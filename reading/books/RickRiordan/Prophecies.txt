The Lightning Thief

You shall go west and face the god who has turned,
You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned,
You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend,
And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.


The Sea of Monsters

You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone,
You shall find what you seek and make it your own,
But despair for your life entombed within stone,
And fail without friends, to fly home alone.


The Titan's Curse

Five shall go west to the goddess in chains,
One shall be lost in the land without rain,
The bane of Olympus shows the trail,
Campers and Hunters combined prevail,
The Titan's curse must one withstand,
And one shall perish by a parent's hand.


The Battle of the Labyrinth

You shall delve in the darkness of the endless maze,
The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.
You shall rise or fall by the ghost king's hand,
The Child of Athena's final stand.
Destroy with a hero's final breath,
And lose a love to worse than death.


The Last Olympian (The Great Prophecy)

A Half-Blood of the eldest gods,
Shall reach sixteen against all odds,
And see the world in endless sleep.
The hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap,
A single choice shall end his days,
Olympus to preserve or raze.


The Heroes of Olympus (The New Great Prophecy/The Prophecy of Seven)

Seven half-bloods shall answer the call.
To storm or fire, the world must fall.
An oath to keep with final breath,
And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.


The Lost Hero

Child of Lightning, beware the earth,
The giants' revenge the seven shall birth,
The forge and dove shall break the cage,
And death unleash, through Hera's rage.


The Son of Neptune

Go to Alaska.
Find Thanatos and free him.
Come back by sundown on June twenty-fourth or die.

To the north, beyond the gods, lies the legion's crown.
Falling from ice, the son of Neptune shall drown.


The Mark of Athena

Wisdom's daughter walks alone,
The Mark of Athena burns through Rome.
Twins snuff out the angel's breath,
Who holds the key to endless death.
Giants' bane stands gold and pale,
Won through pain from a woven jail.


The Sword of Summer

Wrongly chosen, Wrongly slain
A hero Valhalla cannot contain
Nine days hence the sun must go east
Ere Sword of Summer unbinds the beast


The Hammer of Thor

Blitzen
Bloodshed
Cannot be stopped
Before OSTARA


The Hidden Oracle

There once was a god named Apollo
Who plunged in a cave, blue and hollow
Upon a three seater
The bronze fire eater
Was forced death and madness to swallow

Caves of blue.
Strike the hue.
...Westward, burning.
Pages turning.
...Indiana.
Ripe banana.
Happiness approaches.
Serpents and roaches.


The Dark Prophecy

The words that memory wrought are set to fire,
Ere new moon rises o'er the Devil's Mount.
The changeling lord shall face a challenge dire,
Till bodies fill the Tiber beyond count.
	Yet southward must the sun now trace its course,
	Through mazes dark to land of scorching death
	To find the master of the swift white horse
	And wrest from him the crossword speaker's breath.
To westward palace must the Lester go;
Demeter's daughter finds her ancient roots.
The cloven guide alone the way does know,
To walk the path in thine own enemy's boots.
	When three are known and Tiber reached alive,
	Tis only then Apollo starts to jive.


The Burning Maze

Apollo faces death in Tarquin's Tomb unless the doorway to the soundless god is opened by...

Bronze upon gold.
East meets west.
Legions are redeemed.
Light the depths;
One against many,
Never spirit defeated.
Ancient words spoken,
Shaking old foundations!

Destroy the tyrant.
Aid the winged.
Under golden hills,
Great stallion's foal.
Harken the trumpets,
Turn red tides-
Enter stranger's home,
Regain lost glory!
(That says going from top to bottom: "BELLONAS DAUGHTER")
