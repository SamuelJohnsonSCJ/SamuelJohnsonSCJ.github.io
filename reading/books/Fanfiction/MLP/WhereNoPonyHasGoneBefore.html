				<summary>Equestria makes contact with the Enterprise. Star Trek/MLP crossover.</summary>
<p>Equestria finds itself caught in the cold war between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Can friendship prevail, or will this cold war turn hot, despite their best efforts?</p><p>This is a crossover with Star Trek, taking place in late 2269 of the Prime timeline, during the fourth year of the five-year mission of the original television series. It's not a crossover with the movies made by J.J. Abrams. It is mid-season five or so for Friendship is Magic. it is my humble offering for the fiftieth anniversary of Star Trek, which debuted September 8, 1966. </p><p>Thanks to  <a href="/user/236708/FoalsHalf" rel="nofollow">FoalsHalf</a> for being essentially my co-writer/sounding board, and to all those who have helped with proofreading and editing.</p>			</details>

<p>Princess Celestia sat, sipping tea with a guest. This action, in and of itself, was quite a normal activity for her. Her guest, however, was not one most people would call normal.</p><p>At first glance, he was a simple earth pony, wearing a robe that hid a grayish coat and the cutie mark of a reddish ball. His face was that of an older pony, lined, but with nothing beyond that to distinguish it or make it stand out. Anyone in his path would give him a first glance, maybe a second, then a tip of the head and goodbye. If by happenstance they managed to exchange pleasantries, he'd tell them his name, but it wouldn't register in their mind. Alley... something. Maybe.</p><p>The pony, named Ayelborne, of the planet Organia, looked up at Celestia. “They're both young, and a bit violent, but they do seem to have... potential.” He held up a hoof. “I know, I know. 'We were all there one time or another. I shouldn't look down on them like that.'”</p><p>Celestia took a sip of tea. “Hmm, you seem to have the conversation well mapped out. Am I really necessary, here?” Her expression turned serious. “To be honest, that’s the same line I hear from most advanced energy beings who have ‘evolved beyond the need for physical form’. Q, the Metrons, even some of your own people! Come on, Ayelborne. I thought you more like the Douwd, or the Thasians, than Trelane. You can’t blame them for not evolving five billion years earlier than they did.” </p><p>Ayelborne chuckled. “My apologies, Celestia. That <i>was </i>rude and arrogant of me to say.” He cleared his throat. A biscuit floated over to him and he took a bite. “As I was saying, before I interrupted myself, they <i>are</i> young, and nearly went to war. However, last year, two ship captains managed to drive off a rogue windigo through cooperation and laughter!”</p><p>Celestia's teacup slowly floated down to the table, the cup trembling slightly. “That's quite impressive, especially for species with no magic.” She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward. “Do they have magic?”</p><p>“It depends on circumstances and species. What you call 'magic', they use more scientific terms for. Six of one, half a dozen of the other, really. Anyway, they'll be the ones attending this meeting.”</p><p>Celestia half-smiled. “And you didn't have anything to do with that, did you?”</p><p>Another biscuit floated up to Ayelborne, hiding his mouth as he responded. “Oh, I might have put in a good word for them. But they really <i>are</i> the best ones for this, Celestia.” He ate the biscuit, wiped his mouth, and stood up. “As much as I'd like to stay, I think it's time I get going.” He bowed to Celestia. “Thank you very much for the tea and biscuits, and for agreeing to this. I think it will work out quite well for everyone.”</p><p>Celestia frowned, but stood up and returned the bow. “Are you sure you can't stay longer? You haven't even seen Luna, or Cadance, or even my newest student, Twilight Sparkle. She managed to ascend last year.” She stepped over to Ayelborne and leaned down close to him. “She and her friends even managed to get Discord to reform a bit.”</p><p>Ayelborne gasped. “Discord? Behave? Most impressive! Alas, if I'm too long away, Trefayne will start worrying. And you <i>know</i> how he'll get.”</p><p>Celestia rolled her eyes. “Sadly, yes. Is there any chance you could stop by later? Maybe after all this is over?”</p><p>Ayelborne tilted his head back and forth, then slowly smiled. “Maybe I'll bring Trefayne along. He needs to get out a bit more.” His body started brightening. “Good bye for now, Celestia. Good luck, and good success.”</p><p>Celestia watched as he brightened, her eyes never wavering. His form quickly dimmed and faded to nothingness. “Thanks.” Her horn glowed. A quill, inkwell and sheet of parchment floated over. “So much to plan, so little time. Better get Twilight back here, if I can peel her away from that probe.”</p><hr/><p><i>Captain's Log; Stardate </i><i>6011.5</i><i>. The </i>Enterprise<i> is en route to the Klingon Neutral Zone for a diplomatic mission to the Equus System. As per the terms of the Organian Treaty, representatives from the Klingon Empire will be there as well for negotiations. Little is known of the planet, or its inhabitants.</i></p><p>Captain James T. Kirk turned off his log recorder and handed it to the yeoman standing by his chair. He glanced at the viewscreen, taking in the sight of the stars streaking by as the <i>Enterprise</i> traveled at warp speed to its latest destination. He glanced down at the main helm and the two trusted officers stationed there. “Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu.”</p><p>Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu nodded, adjusting several controls. “Aye, sir.”</p><p>Kirk glanced back at the aft science station. There stood Commander Spock, chief science officer and his trusted right-hand. “Mister Spock, this Equus System. What... <i>do</i> we know about it, precisely?”</p><p>Spock straightened up, turned, and pressed several buttons on his station's console. The main viewscreen changed from stars streaking by to a computer-generated image of a planet, a single moon orbiting it, and a star orbiting the planet and moon. “The Equus System, Captain. Two months ago a class-A probe flew by it, malfunctioned and crashed, but not without sending data back. A rather remarkable system, and one I do not believe we have encountered before, at least not naturally-occurring.”</p><p>Sulu's eyes widened. “Mister Spock, am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?” He looked over his shoulder at the half-Vulcan science officer. “A geocentric star system?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Correct, Lieutenant. Somehow A G-type main sequence star, similar to that of Earth's sun, is orbiting a class-M planet and a class-D moon. It defies logic and the known physical laws, yet here it is. Most vexing.”</p><p>Next to Sulu, the newly-promoted Lieutenant Pavel Chekov rubbed his chin. “Hmm, if it's not natural, then someone must have... engineered the system to be like this?”</p><p>Spock looked over at the young helmsman. “A logical deduction, Lieutenant.&quot;</p><p>Kirk snapped his fingers. “Wait, the probe you mentioned, what did it... send back?”</p><p>The image changed from the view of the Equus System to a static-laced shot of a blue sky. A pink head attached to an equine body suddenly slid into view, eyes wide. It looked offscreen and, in a feminine-sounding voice, said, <i>“Twilight! Twilight! I found it! I have no idea what it is, but I found it!” </i>She bounced back slightly. <i>“What is it?”</i></p><p>Another equine appeared, this one purple. A small horn could be seen jutting from her forehead, as well as wings emerging from her back. <i>“I... have no idea, Pinkie.” </i>Her eyes narrowed. <i>“Wait, here's some writing... 'United Federation of Planets</i><i>'.”</i> She shook her head. <i>“We'd better get this to Celestia.”</i></p><p>The image faded out. When it returned, the probe was inside some high-vaulted room. A white head, horned like Twilight's, but quite a bit longer, appeared. She furrowed her brow. <i>“Oh, my...”</i></p><p>The image faded once more, static completely overtaking it. Spock spoke up. “That is the extent of the footage. A survey team was sent out to retrieve the probe and initiate first-contact. After initial cultural exchanges, the ruling government requested a meeting for possible negotiations.”</p><p>Kirk stood up and walked over to the viewscreen. “With the probe located, the Prime Directive pretty much went out the window. And under the terms of the Organian Treaty, the Klingons got an invitation as well.” He looked back to Spock. “Their government? Do they know who set up this...” He waved at the image of the Equus System, “remarkable piece of stellar engineering?”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “The planet is not unified under a central government, but the most powerful country is known as 'Equestria', ruled by the equines we saw in the footage. They witnessed four subtypes, differentiated by wings, horns, having none or both, reminding them of the ancient myths of unicorns and Pegasus. The unicorns exhibited telekinesis, the pegasi flight, and the regular equines had enhanced strength. As for the geocentric nature of the system, most seemed rather surprised and shocked that it was not the norm in the rest of the galaxy. Beyond that, there was little more information they could gather from the natives in the short time they were there.”</p><p>Lieutenant Commander Uhura, chief communications officer and also recently promoted, spoke up from her aft station. “Mister Spock, is there any sample of their native language or writing? I'd like to see if I can work out their language beyond the universal translator, just to make sure we don't miss anything.”</p><p>Spock turned back to his station, bent over and peered into a viewer on the console. “The survey team made some recordings. I shall send them to your station.”</p><p>Uhura touched the transceiver clipped to her ear and turned a dial on her console. Her brow furrowed, and her foot started tapping the deck plating. “Now this is something...” She flashed a brilliant smile. “Quite rhythmic and lyrical. Almost tailor-made for song.”</p><p>Kirk nodded to her. “I look forward to hearing you speak or sing it, Commander.” He looked to Spock. “Well, Mister Spock. Our mission <i>is</i> to... seek out new life and new civilizations. I would say this Equestria qualifies, wouldn't you?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Agreed, Captain. This Equus System presents a rather fascinating mystery.”</p><p>Sulu leaned forward. “You can say that again, Spock.”</p><p>“I do not believe repetition will make the meaning of my words any clearer, Lieutenant.”</p><hr/><p><i>Captain's Log: Supplemental. The </i>Enterprise <i>is approaching the Equus System. The mystery of this system has only grown. How was it constructed, and by who? Could the inhabitants know? Was it... </i>them? <i>The inhabitants of this world? I am eager to find out, yet also</i><i>...</i><i> cautious. Hopefully we shall </i><i>not wake a sleeping dragon</i><i> here.</i></p><p>Kirk leaned forward in his chair as the world of Equus filled the bottom half of the viewscreen. Bright-blue oceans glittered, while even from orbit, large swaths of lush vegetation covered the landscape. He looked down slightly at Sulu and Chekov. “Any problems with orbital insertion, gentlemen?”</p><p>Sulu looked down at the astrogator nestled between the helm and navigation stations. “A little tricky, Captain, but nothing we can't handle.” His head shot up as his console flashed red. “Sensor contact!”</p><p>Spock peered into his viewer. “A Klingon D7-class battlecruiser is approaching, Captain, full impulse.”</p><p>Kirk tensed. He flipped a switch on his armrest. “Yellow alert. Shields up!”</p><p>Klaxons sounded throughout the <i>Enterprise</i>. Crewmembers raced to their ready stations. A tactical viewer rose on Sulu's console. He looked into it as his hands moved across the navigation station. “Captain, the battlecruiser's defensive shields are down, and their weapons are on... cold standby.”</p><p>Uhura spoke up, her expression one of confusion. “Captain, I'm receiving a signal from the battlecruiser, the IKS <i>K'naiah's Pride</i>. Shall I open a channel?” At Kirk's nod, she flipped a switch. “Channel open.”</p><p>A raspy voice came over the internal speakers. <i>“USS </i>Enterprise<i>, we are on a peaceful mission. We do not wish to engage in hostilities. I repeat; we do not wish to engage in </i><i>hostilities</i><i>. Our weapons are powered down.”</i></p><p>Kirk leaned back. “IKS <i>Pride</i>, this is Captain James Kirk of the Federation starship <i>Enterprise</i>. I... apologize for jumping the gun a bit. Your presence startled us. <i>Enterprise</i> out.” He slashed his fingers across his throat.</p><p>Uhura spoke up again. “Captain, we're now receiving a transmission from Equus itself. She identifies herself as... Princess Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p>Chekov and Sulu exchanged a glance. “'Twilight Sparkle'?” Chekov repeated.</p><p>Sulu shrugged. “You got me, Pavel.”</p><p>Kirk sighed. “Put her through, Commander.” He cleared his throat. “Princess Sparkle, this is Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship <i>Enterprise</i>, representing the United Federation of Planets. We come in peace.”</p><p>There was a pause before a static-laced voice came through. <i>“Captain... Kirk? I'm transmitting? YES YES YES! I did it! I got it working!”</i></p><p>Despite himself, Kirk grinned. “Yes, Princess. You are transmitting.”</p><p>“<i>Oh, oh! I am... so sorry, Captain. It's just, this technology is quite beyond anything I've seen before. The survey team showed me a bit how to use it, but getting it working is still quite exciting!”</i> there was a pause. <i>“Okay... according to my checklist, you need coordinates for transporters.”</i> There was a pause. <i>“Is that anything like teleportation?”</i></p><p>Spock spoke up. “Princess, our transporters are designed to convert matter into energy, beam it across space and reassemble on the quantum level at the intended destination.”</p><p>“<i>So that's a yes, I guess? Anyway, here are the coordinates. The location is just outside the town of Ponyville, </i><i>within sight of the capital of Canterlot.</i><i> We'll send some chariots to pick you up and give you a nice tour of the countryside. Is that alright?”</i></p><p>Kirk nodded. “That will be fine, Princess. Please send us the coordinates.”</p><p>Twilight rattled off a string of numbers. <i>“Okay, Captain. I can't wait to meet you! We'll all be great friends! Twilight, over and out!”</i></p><p>Uhura looked down for a moment. “Captain, that was definitely the same Twilight we saw in the footage from the probe.”</p><p>Chekov looked back at her. “You got that from two seconds of her speaking from a probe?”</p><p>Kirk flipped a switch on his armrest. “Spock, Uhura, you're with me.” He leaned in close to a speaker grille next to the switch. “Bones, please meet me in Transporter Room Three. Mister Sulu, you have the conn.” He rose and made his way to the aft turbolift door, Spock and Uhura following.</p><hr/><p>Four shimmering columns of light appeared on the edge of a large, dark forest. They each coalesced into a humanoid figure, fading and leaving behind Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and chief medical officer Leonard 'Bones' McCoy.</p><p>Spock pulled out his tricorder and waved it around. “Gravity is at .9 of Earth. Atmospheric quality is rather remarkable.”</p><p>Bones inhaled deeply. “Now <i>that</i> is some clean, fresh air.”</p><p>Spock flipped his tricorder closed. “I believe I already said that, Doctor,”</p><p>Uhura turned around and looked about. She gasped and pointed as she spotted a large city hanging off the side of a cliff. “Captain, I think I spotted Canterlot.”</p><p>The others followed her gaze. Uhura stepped forward and smiled slightly. “Like Minas Tirith from the old Lord of the Rings novels.”</p><p>Bones chuckled. “A fantasy fan, Lieutenant?”</p><p>Uhura rolled her eyes. “Sulu <i>loves</i> Tolkien’s work, especially the live-action movies they made in the first decade of the twenty-first century. As for myself, I’ve studied them for the languages he created.”</p><p>Bones shrugged. “Ah. Always was more a fan of the Ancient West, myself.”</p><p>Kirk snapped his fingers. “Spock, do you think... whomever built this star system, could have built... <i>Canterlot</i>?”</p><p>Spock flipped out his tricorder once more and pointed it towards Canterlot. “Impossible to tell without more data, Captain. However, it cannot be ruled out.”</p><p>Motion caught their eye. Kirk's hand went for his phaser, but stopped when a small, pink-coated pony appeared, hopping down a path. He quickly recognized her from the probe footage.</p><p>The pony stopped a few feet from Kirk and the others. She looked up at them, eyes widening with every inch she raised her head.</p><p>Kirk held out a hand. “Greetings. I am James T Kirk, representing the United– “</p><p>The pony suddenly jumped into the air. Her mane and tail blew up, not unlike a balloon, as she gasped loudly. She hung in midair for several seconds before dropping back to the ground, turning and speeding off, leaving a cloud of smoke trailing behind her.</p><p>The four stared at her as she sped off. Kirk's jaw canted to the right. “Did you..” He turned to the others, his expression one of total confusion.</p><p>Bones crossed his arms over his chest and scowled. “Beats some of the greetings we've got, but not by much.”</p><p>Kirk looked back to Canterlot. His eyes narrowed as he spotted two large black dots heading away from the castle and towards them. They quickly grew into a pair of chariots, each one pulled by six armored pegasi. “Well, Bones, you can file a complaint with whoever they've got in their diplomatic corps. Unless I'm mistaken, I think that's our ride.”</p>

<p>The two chariots quickly descended as they flew towards the Starfleet officers. They touched down and trotted to a stop in front of the quartet. The pegasi towing the chariots all wore identical plate armor. In the largest chariot stood none other than Princess Twilight Sparkle herself. Unlike in the probe's footage, she wore a crown, cape and golden regalia. Even her saddlebags had golden embroidery to them and were shiny. Before the chariots had stopped, she unhitched the rear door's latch, trotted down and around to stand in front of the Starfleet officers. Twilight strained her neck as she looked up at them, as the top of her head came up to about their waistlines. She bit her lower lip, but the corners of her mouth still curled upward. “Captain Kirk, I presume?” she finally said. “My name is Princess Twilight Sparkle, and welcome to Equestria!”</p><p>Kirk nodded. He dropped down to one knee. “Thank you, your highness. We are... honored to be here.” He motioned to the others. “My science officer Mister Spock, chief medical officer Doctor McCoy, and chief communications officer and expert in xeno-linguistics, Lieutenant Commander Uhura.”</p><p>Twilight nodded along with each one introduced. “Science, medicine, and language. You've got all the bases covered, Captain!” Her horn glowed and a clipboard and quill floated out of one of her saddlebags. “I've had seats installed in the chariots for you, along with safety straps. You'll get a <i>magnificent</i> view of the countryside on the way to Canterlot! Once we arrive, you'll be able to meet with the other three princesses; Celestia, Luna and Cadance.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “These other three princesses, they are... head of the government, along with yourself?”</p><p>Twilight glanced up. “Well, Celestia and Luna are. I'm... not that high up in the hierarchy. Cadance is ruler of the Crystal Empire.”</p><p>Bones slowly walked over to one of the chariots. He looked it over, swallowed, and kicked one of the wooden wheels. “Well, how... interesting.”</p><p>The pegasi all exchanged glances, some of them rolling their eyes.</p><p>Kirk walked over to Bones' side. “Problem, Bones?” He motioned to Twilight. “Come on, we... don't want to keep our hostess waiting.”</p><p>Bones sighed and leaned in close to Kirk. “Jim, I'm not sure this thing is completely safe. Those chairs are bolted in there, and I think I can still see some of the metal shavings from the screws.”</p><p>The lead pegasi of the team hooked up to the chariot looked up at Bones. He cleared his throat. “Doctor? My name is Lieutenant High-Flier. I'd like to assure you that my team has never had an accident in over three-thousand hours of flight-time. We won't let you down.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “Bones, if you'd like, I could arrange for... a shuttle to fly down and pick you up. Just hold your arms up and wave them in when they fly overhead.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Doctor, your trepidation is quite illogical. We witnessed Princess Sparkle traveling in that very chariot on her journey to greet us.” He stepped into the chariot, sat down and strapped himself in.</p><p>Bones groaned. He walked to the back of the chariot, plopped down into a seat and pulled at the straps. “Dammit, if I don't go up <i>now</i>, Spock will never let me hear the end of it.” He finagled a bit with the straps, finally buckling them over his waist and shoulders. “Try not to exceed the speed limit, gentlemen. I'm bad enough with shuttlecraft.”</p><p>Kirk looked up. “Princess Sparkle, pardon the question, but there appears to be only... four seats in the chariots.”</p><p>Twilight smiled and unfolded her wings. “Don't worry, Captain. I'm well-prepared for the trip back to Canterlot.” She glanced down and blushed slightly. “And it gives me a little bit of practice with formation-flying.” She flapped her wings. “Oh, but don't worry! I haven't flown into anyone in a week!”</p><p>Bones gripped the edge of his seat, his knuckles turning white. “Jim, that shuttlecraft you mentioned?”</p><p>Uhura spoke up. “Captain, would you like me to ride with Doctor McCoy? I can hold his hand if he'd like.”</p><p>Kirk waved her off. “Thank you, Commander, but I'll ride with Bones. I'd like you and Spock to confer and bounce ideas off each other, and you'd make a <i>far</i> better sounding-board than I would.”</p><p>Uhura smiled. “Thank you, Captain.” She walked over to Spock's chariot, while Kirk sat down next to Bones and strapped himself in.</p><p>Twilight looked up. “Oh, when we're airborne, we can do a flyby of the Castle of Friendship! You can't see it from this angle, but once we're in the sky we'll pass right by it on our way to Canterlot!” She stomped the ground a few times and giggled. Twilight suddenly stopped, cleared her throat, stretched her wings out and flew up into the sky.</p><p>The pegasi followed suit, quickly taking to the sky. As they ascended, a multi-story castle straight out of a fairy tale came into view. The base looked like a tree carved from crystal, with a huge double-door set into the base. A violet castle was set in its branches, looking like it had grown from the tree itself. A giant crystalline star reached out to the sky from its tallest parapet, shining in the sunlight.</p><p>Twilight flew up besides Kirk and Bones. “That's the Castle of Friendship, Captain.” She squinted, started drifting to the chariot, but stopped and banked a hard left away. “WHOA!”</p><p>High-Flier looked over. “Don't follow your line of sight, your highness! Keep in your proper lane and don't drift!”</p><p>Twilight kept her eyes straight ahead as she nodded. “Got it, High-Flier. Sorry about that, Captain! Ah, as I was saying, that's the Castle of Friendship. I'll... talk a bit more about it when we've got all our hooves and wheels on the ground.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. He turned to Bones, who was now pale as a sheet. “Enjoying the ride?”</p><p>Bones growled. “Jim, next time just <i>beam me</i> to wherever in God's name you need to send me, okay? I'll take my chances!”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted to the left for a moment before he spoke. “I'll... keep that in mind for the next mission, Doctor.” He looked to the castle again, then over to the chariot Spock and Uhura were riding in. He saw both of them with tricorders out, pointing them at the castle. “Good.” He glanced back at Bones. “Any opinions on this... Castle of Friendship?”</p><p>Bones shrugged. “I'm a doctor, Jim, not an architect!” He spared a look over at it. “Hmm, a bit gaudy if you ask me.”</p><p>Kirk went to respond, but a pink streak below caught his attention. He looked down as it winded down a path towards the castle. He waved at Twilight, catching her eye. “Princess! No, no need to fly over here. Could you tell me where Miss... Pinkie, I believe, is going? We had a.... brief meeting before you showed up, but she ran off before we could talk. I hope we didn't... <i>startle</i> her.”</p><p>Twilight glanced over. “Pinkie?” She looked down, eyes quickly locking onto the pink streak. “Oh, Pinkie Pie! No, Captain. I don't think you startled her, or at least any more than she already could be. It's been a bit of a busy couple of weeks for her.”</p><hr/><p>Pinkie Pie galloped down to the Twilight's castle as fast as she could. “They're here they're here!” she yelled as she arrived at the main entrance, dashed inside to the main foyer and stopped on the proverbial bit. Her head craned around. “They're here, and they're all <i>big</i> and important-looking and one of them's got the <i>best</i> ears!”</p><p>High above, Rainbow Dash flew around with Ditzy Doo, the pair hanging a large banner from the ceiling. Rainbow Dash looked down at her friend. “Best ears? What in the–Ditzy, watch out!”</p><p>Ditzy's eyes focused on Rainbow Dash as she flew backwards towards a chandelier. “Watch out for–” She smacked into the chandelier, sending it rattling back and forth. “Oops, I got it!” She dropped her end of the banner, turned around and wrapped her forelegs around the chandelier. She flapped her wings, sending her <i>and</i> the chandelier swinging.</p><p>Pinkie Pie's right ear flopped down. She raced forward as Applejack emerged from another door, tackling her to the ground. The two earth ponies rolled around and and behind a table. “Land's sake, Pinkie!” Applejack shouted, disentangling her limbs from Pinkie Pie's. “What in tarnation–” Her tirade was cut off as the chandelier crashed to the floor, splintering into hundreds of crystalline shards that sprayed into the air.</p><p>Applejack covered her head with her forelegs. She finally looked up and over the table, then back down at Pinkie Pie. “I meant to say, much obliged.” She looked up at Ditzy and shook a hoof at her. “Ditzy, what in the hay?”</p><p>Ditzy scratched the back of her head. “Sorry, Applejack. I tried to catch it.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie's eyes darted back and forth. She shot off, zooming all about the castle. Forty-five seconds later, she ran back in, stopping right where she had taken off from. “Where's Fluttershy? I thought she'd be here to help out?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash floated down. “Mystery of the day, Pinkie. She was with Rarity for their spa appointment this morning, but then Angel ran in, chittered or something, and she said she had to run back to her cottage.”</p><p>Applejack gasped. “Consarnit, you think Discord's up to something?”</p><p>Pinkie Pie ran out, then back in. “No chocolate rain, and everyone's limbs are at their right length. Maybe he's behaving himself?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash, Applejack and Ditzy all looked at each other, then to Pinkie Pie, their eyes narrowing. Pinkie Pie let out a sigh. “Yeah... it sounded silly to me, too.”</p><hr/><p>Fluttershy flew to her cottage at the edge of the Everfree Forest, trailing behind Angel. “Angel, please, there's so much to do back at the castle for the welcome party Pinkie's planned for the visitors. This had better... be...” She trailed off as she turned a bend in the trail and her cottage came into view.</p><p>A large water fountain stood next to the front porch. A statue of Discord stood in the center, arms splayed out and water streaming from its mouth. Angel hopped over to the fountain, chittered, and kicked at the fountain. He let out a shriek and jumped up and down, holding his rear paw.</p><p>Fluttershy flew up to the statue's face and crossed her forelegs. “Discord, what are you doing? The nice people from the Federation are going to be here any minute, if not already! We'd really like your help, so could you please stop fooling around?”</p><p>Discord's stone head slowly turned. He arched an eyebrow, the scrapping of stone against stone sending birds flying and Fluttershy wincing. “My dear, it's precisely <i>because</i> of the people from the Federation that I'm here and like this.”</p><p>A voice from behind caught their attention. “I'd leave him to sulk, Fluttershy. Dear Discord gets <i>so</i> upset <i>so</i> easily. It's rather unbecoming of such a supposedly-evolved being.”</p><p>Fluttershy swung about in midair. She spotted what looked like a human, sitting at a table,underneath a sun umbrella. He wore a red shirt with a pin shaped like the Starfleet arrowhead. He raised his glass and cocked his head to the side. “Well, don't just stand there, Discord. Introduce me! Isn't that what <i>friends</i> do?”</p><p>Discord flashed and turned to flesh once more. He <i>shot</i> into the sky, dwindling to a dot, before turning and flying straight down to the man. The air trembled and vibrated as he picked up speed, a sonic shockwave building around him. About two feet above the table, he spun about, threw his legs out and slowed down within the span of ten inches. He stopped right above another chair and slowly floated down into it. Discord extended his lion's paw across the table. “Q! How marvelous it is to see you! What's shaking, other than the galaxy when we're together?”</p><p>Q chuckled. He put his teacup down and shook Discord's proffered paw. “Oh, not much. Just thought I'd drop by good old Equus and see how an old colleague is doing.” He leaned to his left and looked at Fluttershy. “Now, why don't you introduce me to your friend?”</p><p>Discord leaned to his right, blocking Q's view. “Oh, her? S-she's just someone I t-talk to from time to time. Randomly.”</p><p>Q rolled his eyes. “Rest assured, Discord. I've had my own moment of humility, at least along my personal timeline. She's quite safe.”</p><p>Discord spun about, wrapped his arm around Fluttershy's shoulders and pulled her forward. “Q, this is Fluttershy. Fluttershy, this is Q. His people are called the Q, and he hails from the ever-so <i>imaginatively</i> named Q Continuum.” He looked Q over. “By the way, you're a century too early with that uniform. Having tea with <i>mon capitaine </i>again?”</p><p>Q looked himself over. “Ah, you're right.” He stood up and snapped his fingers. His top changed to a gold-colored shirt, the Starfleet symbol now embroidered over his left breast. Q tugged at the long sleeves and nodded. “Hmm, retro, but it fits well. Clean lines, too.” He sat back down. “So, to get back, what's upset you so? Afraid Klingon opera's gonna become the new popular singing style around here?”</p><p>Discord waved him off. “Believe me, Q. I'd love nothing more for some variety among the music here. The same peppy stuff can get a little wearing.” He looked to Fluttershy. “No offense, my dear. <i>You</i> can make it work, at least.”</p><p>Fluttershy smiled at him. “None taken.”</p><p>Discord slumped in his chair. “I'm a little nervous. You see, a certain captain of a certain starship <i>Enterprise</i> is here. And he's started to get a bit of a reputation among our kind. I'm sure you've heard about him.”</p><p>Q shrugged. “Here and there. Trelane's parents think he did <i>wonders</i> for the little brat. The Organians are rethinking him after he and some Klingon captain had a spat with a windigo last year.”</p><p>Fluttershy gasped and flew forward, Discord restraining her from actually flying into Q's face. “A w-w-windigo? How did they do it?”</p><p>Q tilted his head to the side. “They refused to play its game and laughed it away.” He motioned to Fluttershy. “Now drink up before your root beer loses its fizz.”</p><p>Fluttershy looked to Discord for a second. “Wait, what–” She looked down as a sudden weight hung from her right foreleg. She slowly lifted it up, the handle of a mug of root beer slid onto it. “Oh, my! When did I get this?”</p><p>Q saluted Fluttershy with his teacup before taking a sip. He frowned as Discord glared at him. “Oh, come on! There's nothing wrong with a little bit of root beer between friends. And we're all friends here, right? Now as I was saying, I really think it'd do you a multiverse of good to get out and meet Kirk and his crew. They'll find out about you eventually, so why not do it on your own terms?”</p><p>Discord slammed his paw into the table, sending forth streams of chocolate confetti. “You're right, Q! No need to be shy! Why ten minutes with me and both crews will have a time they'll never forget!”</p><p>Q arched an eyebrow. “I wouldn't go that far. Just show up, say some nice things, don't act too out of line.”</p><p>Discord's expression fell to the table. He placed a paw on his chest. <i>“Moi?</i> I'll be the picture of refinement!” He snapped his talons and vanished in a flash of custard.</p><p>Q looked to Fluttershy. “Well, my dear. Could I interest you in a tour of the galaxy? I promise, no harm will come to you! I'll have you back in plenty of time to meet the Federation and Klingon crews.”</p><p>Fluttershy swallowed and looked down to her half-empty mug of root beer. “I don't know, Mister Q. I've got a lot to do back at the castle.” She suddenly gasped and bolted into the air. “Oh, my gosh! I'm late! Everyone is going to be so... so peeved at me!” She shrunk down into herself and blushed. “Pardon the Prench.” She waved to her cottage. “If you need anything the door's unlocked. Help yourself!” And with that, she flew off.</p><p>Q rubbed his chin, but shook his head. “Hmm, no. It wouldn't be good to take advantage of such kindness. If Discord likes her, and she's managed to tame the beast, no need to push any luck.” He stood up and tugged down on the front of his shirt. “I'd better be off, anyway. Things to do, lessons to teach.” Q snapped his fingers and he, the table, and chairs, all vanished.</p><hr/><p>The two chariots flew over the bustling metropolis of Canterlot, passing by gleaming towers and onion-shaped domes. Kirk let out a sigh. “Like out of a... fairy tale, Bones. Complete with princesses and magic.”</p><p>Bones chuckled. “You forget, Jim. Those fairy tales had wicked stepmothers and monsters.”</p><p>Kirk nodded as they flew towards a rather large castle and descended towards the front entrance. The pegasi touched down at the foot of a long staircase that led up to two golden double-doors. Stallions in plate armor and wielding spears, swords, shields and crossbows lined the stairs and milled about, some casting suspicious glances at the chariots.</p><p>Twilight Sparkle touched down and trotted over to Kirk and Bones' chariot, even as they unbuckled themselves. Her horn glowed and the back door opened, allowing them to walk out. “I'm <i>really</i> sorry about what happened up there,” she said, blushing. She looked back to her wings and sighed. “Maybe next time I'll teleport us all up here. I trust my horn more than my wings.”</p><p>Kirk arched an eyebrow. “Oh? Any particular reason why, Princess?”</p><p>Twilight shrugged. “Oh, I only got my wings about a year and a half ago.” She stretched them out. “I'm a <i>lot</i> better than when Rainbow Dash had to give me flying lessons for the first month or so.”</p><p>Bones' jaw worked to the side. He pulled his tricorder from around his shoulder, flipped the top open and pulled out a small scanner. “Your highness, would it be alright if I took some scans of you with my tricorder?”</p><p>Twilight slowly walked forward. “A tri... corder? What does it do, Doctor? Is it some sort of recording device?”</p><p>Bones dropped to one knee. “It scans your body and gives me information on it. Heart rate, temperature, nervous system, the works.” He turned the scanner around and waved it over his head and upper body. “You won't feel a thing. I promise.”</p><p>Kirk leaned down and looked at the tricorder's screen. “Bones, I think your blood pressure's a bit elevated.”</p><p>Bones turned his head and glared at Kirk. “You're still due your annual physical, <i>Captain</i>. Don't make me pull rank on you!”</p><p>Spock and Uhura walked over from their own chariot. “Doctor, I do not believe it is wise to remind the captain of his medical appointments in the middle of first-contact procedures.”</p><p>Bones slowly stood and directed his glare at Spock. “I was simply exercising my duties as chief medical officer to remind Captain Kirk of necessary appointments, Mister Spock, nothing more. I'm sure Princess Sparkle would appreciate my concern for the captain's welfare.”</p><p>Uhura stepped between the two and held her hands up. “Okay, you two. Let's simmer down, the both of you.” She looked down at Twilight and swallowed. “My apologies, your highness. Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy are both rather... passionate and can let their tempers flare.” She narrowed her eyes and looked from one to the other. “And they're both <i>very sorry</i> for acting like this in public.”</p><p>Twilight waved her off. “Not a problem, Commander. They actually remind me a bit of some of my <i>own</i> friends.” She rubbed her chin. “I think I know how to help them get along better... but we'll save that for later.” She floated her clipboard out of her saddlebag once more and looked it over. “Now, the Klingon delegation's already arrived and should be in the throne room. Once you enter, Celestia, Luna and Cadance will come in and greet you all on equal footing.” She turned and trotted up the stairs. “Right on schedule, excellent!”</p><p>Kirk rose and flashed a smile. “Thank you, Princess.” He started up the stairs, the other three by his sides. “Opinions?”</p><p>Spock pursed his lips. “I do not believe the Equestrians mean us any harm, Captain. Princess Sparkle seems most sincere in her wish to open dialog with us and 'become friends', as she's said. I am, however, concerned that we do not know the identity of the Klingon's representative.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “I think I have an idea who it is. You remember the name of the battlecruiser in orbit?”</p><p>Uhura spoke up. “ <i>K'naiah's Pride, </i>Captain. If I remember, that's a proper name.”</p><p>Kirk nodded to her. “Excellent ear as always, Commander. I've done some research, and that's the name of a relative of an... <i>acquaintance</i> of ours from the Empire.” He stopped as the double-doors swung open. They walked down a short hallway, past some rather impressive stained-glass windows, through another set of doors, and entered the main Throne Room.</p><p>Ponies were scattered about, clustered in small groups. Most of them wore fancy clothing or some sort of adornment in their mane or tail. Near the back was a pair of thrones set against the wall. Near the doors stood three Klingons, two instantly recognizable to the Starfleet officers, and the third at least somewhat familiar.</p><p>Captain Kang of the Klingon Defense Force looked up and locked eyes with Kirk. He broke from the other two and strode up to Kirk. “So, the Federation sends the one Starfleet captain, the one <i>human</i>... I respect.” He thumped his chest, then shot his clenched fist into the air in salute. <i>“</i><i>qaleghqa'mo' jIQuch</i>, James Kirk, son of George Kirk!”</p><p>Kirk returned the salute. “Greetings, Kang, son of K'naiah.”</p><p>Kang looked Kirk over. “I am... honored that you know my father's name, Kirk. A little surprised, but honored.”</p><p>Kirk spread his arms out. “There's an old saying. 'If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles'.”</p><p>The other two Klingons walked up to Kang's side. One of them rubbed his chin. “That's very similar to one of our own proverbs, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk looked to him. “That particular quote was from a warrior-philosopher known as Sun Tzu, from Earth's past.”</p><p>The Klingon grinned. “There may be hope for your people yet, Captain!”</p><p>Kang motioned to him. “My first officer, Kina, whom you may remember from nearly being enslaved by that hate entity.” His face grew hard. “I kept together the survivors of my previous command. It was the least I could do for them.” He turned to the other and his expression softened. “And of course you remember my wife and the ship's chief science officer, Mara.”</p><p>Mara nodded to Kirk and the others. “Captain Kirk, with your permission, I'd like to confer with Mister Spock later today about some rather... pressing matters.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Are you referring to the rather... fascinating layout of this star system?”</p><p>Bones slapped his forehead. “Dear god, he said 'fascinating'. We're all doomed.”</p><p>Mara studiously ignored Bones and kept her focus on Spock. “A geocentric star system, Mister Spock! In all my years, I've never seen anything like it. If this actually occurred naturally, I'll... I'll let myself be covered up to my neck in tribbles!”</p><p>Bones opened his mouth, but Kirk held a hand up in front of his face. “Bones... <i>not now</i>.” He looked to Kang. “I have no objections to the two working together, but if they do, there can be no secrets or unreported discoveries... on <i>either</i> side.”</p><p>Kang slowly nodded. “I agree, Kirk. We are dealing with powerful beings, and after the hate entity and the Organians, I am a bit... wary of inciting their wrath.” He looked to Spock. “I grant you permission to work with Mara, but do not attempt any subterfuge. I am willing to cooperate, but only up to a point.”</p><p>Kirk let out a brief sigh. “Well, it's a... start, at least. Thank you, Kang.”</p><p>Twilight walked over to the group. By her side was Prince Blueblood. “So, how are things going?”</p><p>Kirk knelt down slightly. “Better than expected, Princess. Thank you.”</p><p>Mara walked around Kang and loomed over Twilight. “Princess, do you have any information on how your star system manages to maintain a geocentric orbit with a G-type main sequence star? How was this engineered?”</p><p>Twilight looked up to her, ears folding back. “W-well, to tell you the truth, Mara... up until meeting you, the idea of a heliocentric star system just seemed... odd, almost science-fiction.”</p><p>The stallion let out a sigh and tossed his muzzle into the air. “Your highness, <i>please</i> do not tell me you're actually buying their talk of planets going around stars. I mean, really! If they can't control the orbits of their stars, how do they plan out the weather-management properly?”</p><p>Kang growled and clenched his fists. “You would do well not to accuse my wife of lying!”</p><p>The color drained from Blueblood and he shrank down. “I-I w-was not accusing her of that! J-just merely expressing some... incredulity at the claims of planets going around stars. When all you've seen is Auntie Celestia controlling the sun for your entire life, the idea of it being the other way around just... it's just incredible!”</p><p>Twilight's eyes narrowed. “Blueblood, need I remind you of the videos the first-contact teams showed us?” Her mouth turned up. “If you'd like, think of how special <i>we</i> are, compared to the rest of the galaxy!”</p><p>Blueblood arched an eyebrow. “Well... if you put it <i>that</i> way...”</p><p>Kang and Kirk glanced to each other. “The ruler of this land is the one who controls the sun,” Kang said. He growled. “The name <i>should</i> have been a clue to me.”</p><p>Kirk rubbed his chin. “Well, that's... one than one mystery solved. Although it might create some more.”</p><p>Any more talk was halted as trumpets sounded out. Everyone turned as a pair of doors opened. “Presenting Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Princess Cadance!” a page shouted, as the three alicorns emerged, each one clad in glittering regalia from horn to hooves.</p><p>Kirk snapped his fingers. “Luna... the <i>moon</i>!” he half-whispered to Kang.</p><p>Every pony there, Twilight and Blueblood included, dropped down to their knees and bowed their heads. Celestia looked around and smiled. “Welcome, everyone! I'm glad to see you all here.” The crowds parted as she and Luna walked up to Kirk and Kang, Twilight and Blueblood backing off slightly. “Greetings, and welcome to Equestria.”</p><p>Kang stood up straight as they approached. “I am Captain Kang, along with my first officer Kina, and science officer Mara. We represent the Klingon Empire in these negotiations.” He thumped his chest and held his fist out in salute. “Glory, and honor to us all!”</p><p>Kirk bowed his head. “I am Captain James T. Kirk, representing the United Federation of Planets, along with my science officer Mister Spock, chief communications officer Nyota Uhura, and Doctor Leonard McCoy. We hope for a... mutually beneficial treaty to be signed and diplomatic relations to be opened between us.”</p><p>Luna approached, her expression cool. “A noble goal, Captain Kirk, but we are all too aware of the current state of hostilities between the Federation and Klingon Empire, of planets used as proxy battlegrounds by you.” She stepped back and her horn lit up. A small map of the Neutral Zone between the Federation and Klingon Empire appeared. Small flashes of light blossomed and died in the blackness. “Mark my words, gentlemen. We have the means to defend ourselves if either of you become hostile.”</p><p>Celestia smiled. “Hopefully it won't come to that. Both of you seem reasonable enough to avoid any unwise actions.” Her eyes narrowed by the slightest of margins. “But we will be watching, just in case.”</p><p>Kang rubbed his chin. “I do not think we have any means to combat the sun or moon being used against us. I swear upon my honor, Princesses, that my crew will not cross any lines set by you. We may... stretch them a bit, but we will not cross them.”</p><p>Kirk held his right hand up. “I too swear upon my honor that the crew of the <i>Enterprise</i> will behave itself.” He looked to Kang. “And I... trust you on your word, Kang.”</p><p>Celestia and Luna exchanged a glance and nodded to each other. “Excellent,” Celestia said, beaming. “There will be a formal dinner here in Canterlot tonight at six o’clock, local time. In the meanwhile, the crew of your ships are free to come down, explore Equestria, make friends!” She looked to Twilight. “I know of someone rather… knowledgeable in that last field.”</p><p>Mara grunted. “Yes, ‘friends’.”</p><p>Kirk turned to Spock and stepped in close. “Spock, I’m sorry, but I need you on the bridge, working with Mara on this… mystery of a star system. I meant what I said to Kang about trust. No <i>secrets </i>between you on this matter.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Understood, Captain. I find this mystery to be most intriguing.”</p><p>Kirk looked over as Kang, Mara, and Kina approached. “My bridge is... your bridge, Mara.”</p><p>Kang glanced to his left. “Mara, go to your science station at the <i>Pride’s </i>bridge and copy every log, every scan you’ve taken of this star system since we entered sensor range, then go to the <i>Enterprise</i>. Kina, organize the crew for shore-leave rotations. Make sure you’re on the list.”</p><p>Kina and Mara saluted Kang. While they beamed up, Kang looked to Kirk. “I wonder what sort of food… ponies eat.”</p><p>Kirk scratched his head. “A good question, Kang. I worked on a ranch back in Iowa, but I’m not sure how… <i>close</i> to them Equestrians are, biologically-speaking.” He looked over. “Bones, get some scans done, if you can. Uhura, work on their language.” He slipped his communicator out of his belt and flipped it open. <i>“Enterprise.”</i></p><p><i>“Lieutenant M’ress here, Captain.”</i></p><p>“Lieutenant, announce shore-leave for the crew. Also, let Sulu know that Mister Spock will be collaborating with science officer Mara from the <i>K'naiah's Pride.</i> She’s to be allowed full access to the sensor logs. Kirk out.”</p><p>Twilight tilted her head, finally speaking up. “Captain Kirk? Captain Kang? If neither of you have any duties at the moment, I’d love to take you on a tour of my castle, and of Ponyville. I think both of you would find it really enlightening and fun!”</p><p>Kang and Kirk exchanged a look. “I suppose it would be the best use of my time,” Kang said.</p><p>Kirk knelt down and held his arms out. “I would be… honored to take a tour of your castle, Princess.”</p><p>Twilight smiled. “Thanks, but please. Just call me Twilight, okay? My friends do.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “All right… Twilight.”</p><p>Twilight waved them closer with her wings. “Okay, I can teleport all three of us right to my castle’s gate. It’ll be just like your transporters, and a lot faster than chariot,” she said, winking at Kirk.</p><p>Kang took a step back. At Twilight’s expression, he motioned to Kirk. “The last time he and I were transported together, it did not end so well for me.”</p><p>Kirk rolled his eyes and looked over his shoulder. “Come on, Kang. We were <i>both</i> influenced by that hate entity. Besides, we worked it out in the end.” He waved him forward. </p><p>Kang growled, but knelt beside Kirk. “Very well, but mark my words, Princess. I’ll be on guard when we arrive for any trickery.”</p><p>Twilight’s horn lit up. “No trickery, Captain. I swear on <i>my</i> honor.” All three were enveloped by a flash of light. When it faded, they were gone.</p>

<p>With a flash of light, Twilight, Kang, and Kirk appeared in front of Twilight's castle. Kang slowly stood up and looked around. “Barely any time at all. Much more efficient than our own transporters, Princess. If we could learn how you do this naturally and be able to emulate it with our own transporters, it would be a great boon for everyone, and bring honor and glory to your family.”</p><p>Twilight grinned. “I'd be more than happy to research ways to do that, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk walked up to the castle's front wall. He slowly held up a hand to the violet crystal, noting the soft luminescence. “There's... power, here. This castle, Twilight. This... <i>crystalline</i> formation. How was it formed?”</p><p>Twilight let out a low nicker. “That, Captain... is a bit of a long story, admittedly. Would it be all right if I told you after the tour? Or maybe during it?”</p><p>Kirk slowly nodded. “That would be... fine, Twilight. I look forward to hearing it.”</p><p>Twilight led the pair up to the doors. “Well, for the record, this is the Castle of Friendship.” Her horn glowed and the double-doors slowly opened. “It's my residence, along with my assistant Spike and–” Twilight's eyes went wide, and she slammed the doors shut. “Captains, if you could... excuse me?” she said, her right eye twitching.</p><p>Kang's right hand drifted down to the disruptor holstered at his belt. “What's going on inside, Princess?”</p><p>A nervous chuckled escaped twilight. “Inside? Inside, yes! No, nothing's going on inside, Captain Kang!” Her horn lit up. “Nothing bad... I hope.” She suddenly vanished.</p><p>Kang growled. “Jumpier than a Tarcassian razorbeast!”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted to the right. He held out his hands. “Can't disagree with you on that, Kang.” He walked up to the door. “Think someone threw her a party and forgot to tell her?”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “I wouldn't mind a bit of merriment, Kirk.” He arched an eyebrow at the captain's expression. “Surprised? We Klingons aren't all work or scheming or fighting. Mara and I enjoy going out for an evening of entertainment. We're fond of opera, and the occasional concert.”</p><p>A sigh escaped Kirk. “A bit surprised, yes. I'll admit I'm not sure I can envision you two going for a night at the opera.”</p><p>Kang half-smiled. “Would it make it easier to know we both make sure to bring our <i>batt'leths</i> with us, in case we are displeased with the performance?”</p><p>“That... <i>would</i> make it easier, yes.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight appeared inside the front hall. “PINKIE!”</p><p>Pinkie Pie hopped from around one of the tables and over to Twilight. “Do you like it? Do you think they'll like it? How are they? Do they like Equestria? Sorry about the chandelier. I think we got everything swept up. Fluttershy helped with–”</p><p>Twilight stuck a hoof in Pinkie Pie's mouth. “Pinkie, you did a... great job setting all this up. Thank you very much for taking the time and effort.” She looked around. “Thank you, everyone. I really do appreciate your hard work.” She stopped and locked eyes with Pinkie. “Wait, what about what chandelier?”</p><p>Applejack cleared her throat. “I think I hear a 'but' in that first part, sugarcube.”</p><p>Twilight's cheeks colored slightly. “Right. But... I don't think it would be wise to shout 'surprise' at them or act a bit too... enthusiastic. At least at first.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie leaned back, extricating Twilight's hoof. “I understand, Twilight. No shouting, no jumping up and down.” She paused. “Can we sing?”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin. “Maybe later.” She turned and opened the doors with her magic. “Captains?”</p><p>“... Come now, Kirk! Mara and I thought the Federation had death camps, and plotted the destruction of the Empire. I'll proudly admit we can be fierce warriors, but there's more to us than combat and killing.”</p><p>“True, Kang. Our little... trip on the <i>Enterprise</i> made that quite clear. Old prejudices die hard.” Kirk stopped speaking and turned. “Ah, Twilight. Any problems inside?”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “No, Captain Kirk.” She walked up to the two and escorted them inside. “Everyone, this is Captain James Kirk of the United Federation of Planets, and Captain Kang of the Klingon Empire. Captains, these are my best friends.”</p><p>“Howdy, Captains!”</p><p>“It's wonderful to meet such handsome-looking officers.”</p><p>“H-hello, sirs.”</p><p>“Hey, welcome to the coolest planet in the galaxy!”</p><p>Pinkie Pie hopped forward, a tray of food balanced on her head. “Welcome to Equestria!” she shouted, bouncing up and down. A muffin flew up in Kirk's direction, while a broiled salmon on a stick tumbled over to Kang. “Enjoy!”</p><p>Kirk looked the muffin over. “Thank you, Pinkie.” He took a small bite of the muffin, then another larger one. “Quite nice.”</p><p>Pinkie beamed at him and jumped up and down. “Thank you, Captain!”</p><p>Kang looked the salmon over. His nose wrinkled as he sniffed at it, finally taking a bite. “Not bad,” he admitted. He looked to Kirk. “I thought you said horses on Earth were herbivores.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “<i>Mostly</i> herbivores, Kang. I've seen more than one horse <i>kill</i> a squirrel and eat it back at the farm.” He spread his arms out. “Not that this is my old farm, of course”</p><p>Near one of the tables, Applejack arched an eyebrow. “Must've been one <i>hungry</i> horse to have to do that.”</p><p>Fluttershy walked over to the captains. “I'm very happy to hear you like the salmon, Captain Kang. I caught and cooked it myself.”</p><p>Kang tore off a large strip and swallowed it, quickly finishing it off. As soon as he had stripped it to the bone, Pinkie Pie stood before him, a mug of cider balanced on her head. He slowly picked it up off of her and looked it over. “Not quite warnog or blood wine...” He took a sip, swishing it about in his mouth before swallowing it. “I may grow to like this place, or at least its cuisine.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “Well, Kang. It's a start.” He looked down and spotted Pinkie Pie with another mug of cider on her head. His brow furrowed, but he picked it up and tilted it to Kang. “To... friendship, Kang. And to you.”</p><p>Kang said nothing, but tilted his own mug imperceptibly towards Kirk before draining it dry.</p><p>Twilight slowly wandered from the pair and over to Applejack and Rainbow Dash. “Hey, have either of you seen Spike? I'm surprised he's not down here. I need to ask him something.”</p><p>Applejack waved a foreleg to the back door leading to the kitchen. “Last I saw the little guy, he was still working on the food. Nearly wore the scales off his claws he was going so quick making food and getting the place ready.”</p><p>Twilight glanced to the door, face falling slightly. “Oh, the poor guy. I was fretting so much about this, and he wanted to help out as much as he could.” She stomped a hoof to the ground. “I'm getting him out of there, <i>and</i> getting him an extra-large ruby as a present for him.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash took another gulp from her mug of cider and let out a slow sigh. “Ah, that's the good stuff.” She looked to Twilight. “What do you need Spike for, anyway?”</p><p>Twilight glanced back at Kang and Kirk. “Well... you know about the magic mirror, Sunset and the alternate reality where everyone kind of looks like them?”</p><p>Applejack's jaw dropped. “Oh, horse apples! You think they came from there?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes. “Applejack, they're not from another dimension... right?” She leaned over and looked at the two captains. Fluttershy was conversing with Kang, while Rarity was eyeing Kirk. “Are they?”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “No, Dash. They're not from another dimension... I think.” Her clipboard and quill floated out of her saddlebag. “I might have to look into that with Sunset.”</p><p>Applejack reached over, pushed the clipboard down, and locked eyes with Twilight. “Twilight, I don't think it would be too good of an idea to go back to Canterlot High while we got <i>aliens</i> visiting Equestria. Might be a bit rude. Send a letter, but don't go traipsing over there, you hear?”</p><p>Twilight swallowed. “Oh, gosh, you're right. I can just send a letter, no problem.” She reached out and patted Applejack on the shoulder. “Thanks. I'm gonna go see Spike for a moment.” With that, she walked back and through the doors to the kitchen.</p><p>Applejack and Rainbow Dash exchanged a look. “Think we gotta tie her down?” Applejack asked.</p><p>Rainbow Dash wiggled her head back and forth. “She'll be fine. I think.” She drained her mug dry. “I hope.”</p><hr/><p>Mara stood in the Enterprise's bridge, next to Spock's science station. She inserted a computer tape into a slot on the glossy-black console. “I'm a little surprised our technology is so... compatible.”</p><p>Spock, standing next to her, arched an eyebrow. “I have adapted the interface for a wide variety of non-Federation information storage units. Considering the wide variety of systems I have encountered, I felt it a logical course of action.”</p><p>The computer station whirred, clicked, and clacked. A vaguely-feminine voice sounded out over the intercom. <i>“Data input successful. Integrating with previous scans.”</i></p><p>Spock pressed a few buttons and turned a dial on his console. He then turned and walked up to the main viewscreen, past Sulu as he sat in the captain's chair. “Mister Sulu, with your permission?”</p><p>Sulu leaned forward and gripped the armrests tight. “Mister Spock, go right ahead. I'm itching to see what we've got here.”</p><p>Spock spoke. “Computer, display sensor information from the <i>K'naiah's Pride's </i>sensor logs, starting from their entrance into the Equus System.”</p><p>The computer triple-beeped. <i>“Acknowledged. Analyzing...” </i>The image on the viewscreen changed from Equus to an overhead view of the system itself. Lines, charts and boxes of text sprang up. The rest of the bridge crew all slowly looked to the viewscreen.</p><p>Mara walked up to Spock's side. She pointed to a pair of lines, one that reached from Equus to the star, the other from Equus to the planet's moon. “Princess Sparkle said that Celestia is the one who controls the sun. The <i>Pride's</i> sensors <i>have</i> detected gravimetric distortions coming from the planet, along with some other energy waves. We've been able to trace it to the star, and another to the moon as well.” She bared her teeth in a grin. “Celestia and Luna, apt names. Twilight Sparkle, Blueblood...” She leaned back. “Does that mean he's anemic?”</p><p>Sulu spoke up. “Actually, Lieutenant, 'blue blood' used to refer to upper classes and nobility on Earth. It wasn't exactly used in the most flattering of manner.” His brow furrowed. “Wait, one of them has the <i>actual</i> name 'Blue Blood'?”</p><p>Mara barked a laugh. “Yes. He did not make the best impression on anyone there, and Princess Sparkle seemed to have had to deal with him before.” She looked to Spock. “I think this is something we should investigate, among other things.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “It <i>would </i>be an interesting query, Mara. Our sample size has been a bit limited, so far. I will assign Commander Uhura to investigate further.”</p><p>At the communication station, Lieutenant M'ress spoke up. “Well, you'll be able to get a larger sample size at the dinner tonight,” the Caitian said, her whiskers twitching.</p><p>Mara turned and glanced at M'ress. “I had almost forgotten about that.” She looked to the viewscreen and scowled. “I do not have time for such frivolities. There are so many questions. How does Celestia control the sun, precisely? The gravimetric distortions we've detected shouldn't be enough to move this star! Is she utilizing subspace? Does it have to do with that unknown energy? How is she doing it, and how did she gain control of the sun in the first place, if it <i>was</i> her, and not some other being?”</p><p>M'ress leaned back in her chair and drummed her claws against the console, producing tiny dents. “She and her sister could be part of a race of advanced energy beings in the guise of mortals. The Organians appeared as Iron-Age peasants when we first encountered them, and look at what they did when roused. The could have also evolved this way from the ponies themselves.”</p><p>Spock turned to her. “Princess Sparkle <i>did</i> mention that she 'received her wings' approximately a year and a half ago. Your observations definitely merit further investigation, Lieutenant.”</p><p>M'ress' ears perked up. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>Mara shook her head. “I'm... not sure if it would be wise to ask during dinner. It may sound cowardly, but I do not wish to risk their ire and be facing down a solar flare, or their moon being used as a battering ram against our ships.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “As a wise man once said, only a fool fights in a burning house. And one should not confuse caution with cowardice.”</p><p>Mara snorted and crossed her arms. “I hate to admit it, but you're right, Spock. Only a fool fights the storm. We could ask Princess Sparkle, but I'm not sure what she'd know of it. She expressed shock at the idea of a heliocentric star system. It's possible she's never done much research into the system.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “I find that <i>highly</i> unlikely, Mara. At the very least, we will not know what she knows, until we ask.”</p><p>A bark of laughter escaped Mara. “You're right.” She looked herself over, her expression darkening. “Neither Kang nor I are diplomats. He is a warrior, while I am more at home in a lab. We still don't know why we were chosen for this assignment.”</p><p>Sulu rubbed his chin in thought. “Maybe the politicians remember last year, when we managed to cooperate and fight off that thing that was manipulating us into fighting each other. As Mister Spock would say, we're the 'logical' choice for a diplomatic mission.”</p><p>Mara looked to him. “As good an explanation as any.” She looked back to Spock. “I must return to the <i>Pride</i> and prepare for the dinner, as well as checking on our own sensors.” She thumped her chest. <i>“Qap'la</i>, Spock!”</p><p>Spock held his right hand up, fingers splayed in the traditional Vulcan Salute. “Live long and prosper, Mara.” He turned to Sulu as Mara walked to the aft turbolift. “Commander, it would be most prudent for us to prepare for the dinner as well. The senior staff of both vessels should be in attendance.”</p><p>Sulu slid out of the command chair and tugged down on his shirt. “Probably wouldn't be a good idea to be outdone by the Klingons in diplomacy.” He turned and made his way to the aft turbolift, Spock following. “I think that's one achievement the <i>Enterprise</i>  doesn't want to be first in.”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “Indeed not, Commander. I do not believe we would ever escape that stigma.” The turbolift doors slid open, allowing the pair to enter. “Lieutenant M'ress, you have the conn,” he said, mere moments before the lift doors closed.</p>

<p>Kirk finished off his muffin. As soon as he swallowed, another one bounced up at him. He caught it, but lowered it back down to Pinkie Pie. “Thank you, Miss Pie, but I think I'm... full.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie nodded. “I figured, Captain. Thank you very much for enjoying them!” Her tongue snaked out, wrapped around the muffin and pulled it into her mouth. She gulped it down, grinning.</p><p>Rarity rolled her eyes. “Pinkie Pie, <i>please</i>! Don't be so uncouth around our guests!” She looked up at Kirk. “Please accept my apologies for her behavior, Captain. Pinkie means well, but can be a bit foalish.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Thank you, Miss Belle, but it's all right. She's a wonderful cook, and should enjoy the... <i>fruits</i> of her labor.” He paused. “So, you're a... seamstress?”</p><p>Rarity tossed her head back and forth. “Well, I prefer to think of myself as an <i>artiste</i>, and fabric is my canvas!” She stood up on her hind legs. “I use fabric, gemstones, and thread to create wearable works of art!” She looked Kirk up and down, eyes narrowing. “Hmm, your uniform is a bit... well, I suppose 'functional' would be preferable in space, correct?” She held up a hoof. “Oh, and please, call me 'Rarity'.”</p><p>A smile crossed Kirk's mouth. “Very well, Rarity.” He looked to Pinkie Pie. “And your profession, Miss Pie? Let me guess... baking?”</p><p>Pinkie Pie let out a loud gasp. “How'd you know?!”</p><p>“Lucky guess.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie nodded rapidly. “Yeah, I live with Mister and Missus Cake at Sugarcube Corner in Ponyville. Before that, I lived with my family on our rock farm.” Her eyes glazed over slightly, then regained focus. “All day long, it was rotating the fields. Move the crystals from the south field to the north field, the feldspar from the–”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Wait, did you say... <i>rock farm</i>?” His jaw worked for a moment. “Is that some sort of... mine? Does your family work in mineralogy?”</p><p>Pinkie Pie laughed and waved him off. “Oh, no! The Pie family's been farmers for generations. Well, okay. My sister Maud's getting a rocktorate, but that's pretty much the extent of our higher education.”</p><p>Kirk hesitated. “I... see? So what does your family do with these rocks?”</p><p>Rarity waved Kirk down to her. As he dropped down to her level, she leaned in close. “Captain, if I may explain a bit better, Pinkie's family uses earth pony magic to imbue certain kinds of rocks and crystals with naturally-occurring energy. Admittedly, some of it <i>does</i> involve digging up rocks, but it's more about placement for them.”</p><p>Kirk nodded, his expression clearing. “I see. Thank you, Rarity.” He looked to Pinkie Pie. “And I... apologize for my confusion, Pinkie. As my first officer would say, it sounds quite fascinating.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie waved him off. “Oh, don't worry, Captain. Sometimes <i>I</i> don't know what I'm talking about.” With that, she turned and hopped back to one of the buffet tables.</p><p>Kirk watched her bounce away. “I should have Scotty look into this... rock farming. Perhaps with Ensign Naraht.”</p><p>Rarity looked back to Kirk. “So, Captain? Would I be able to interest you in some civilian-style clothes? Truth be told, barring Spike, I don't believe I've ever worked on a biped before!”</p><p>Off to the side, Kang stood near a wall, Applejack and Fluttershy flanking him. He held up a mug of cider and eyed it. “So, this is what you call cider?”</p><p>Applejack nodded, grinning. “Yes, sir! Made with pride by my family! You <i>can't</i> get better cider anywhere in Equestria! I should know, I make it myself.”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. He tilted the mug back and took a sip. He swished it around in his mouth before swallowing. “Not bad, not bad at all!” He took a big gulp. “You bring honor to your House, Applejack.”</p><p>Applejack slid her hat off her head and held it close to her chest. “Thank you kindly, Captain!” She paused and arched an eyebrow. “Beggin' your pardon, though but what's 'House' mean in the way you used it?”</p><p>Kang looked down at her. “My family, extended family, all our property and holdings. I am the head of my House, the House of Kang.”</p><p>Applejack slowly nodded. “Ah, I get it. I'd be part of the House of Apple, then. I got kin <i>all</i> over Equestria.” She looked to Fluttershy. “Sound about right?”</p><p>Fluttershy nodded. “I think it's a wonderful name, Applejack.” She looked back to Kang. “Captain, can I get you any more salmon? I've got some other meat-based foods, too. Do you eat plants, or baked goods?”</p><p>Kang shrugged. “It depends.” He smiled slightly. “My mother makes the best <i>rokeg</i> blood pie in the whole Beta Quadrant. Whenever I came home from the Academy, I'd walk in and the smell would hit me like a disruptor blast.” He looked to the tables. “Did you catch the fish yourself?”</p><p>Fluttershy nodded. “Oh, yes! I take care of a lot of animals, and they all have <i>very</i> different dietary needs. Some need plants, some need meat, some need a combination of both. All part of the circle of life.”</p><p>Applejack nodded. “I hear you on that, Fluttershy.” At Kang's look, she shrugged. “Sweet Apple Acres, my farm. All sorts of critters, plus my dog Winonna. Gotta make sure they're all properly fed.”</p><p>Kang leaned forward a bit. “A farm, you say? How well is it run? How efficient is it?'</p><p>Applejack's brow furrowed. “Well, we do a good job. It's only four of us, you see, and Granny Smith is... getting on in years. We can get three, maybe four crops in a year before–”</p><p>“Three or four crops?” Kang said, eyes widening.</p><p>Applejack shrank back a bit. “Ah... yeah. Although some of the larger farms in my family can manage more.” She paused. “Is that a problem?”</p><p>Kang shook his head. “I would call that a miracle, especially if we were to learn how you do it.” At her stare, he growled and stared off at the far wall. “Q'onos has little arable land, and many of the planets in the Empire are poor in resources.”</p><p>Applejack scratched the side of her head. “Well... I'm not so sure how much of it you Klingons can 'learn', but I'll do my best to help. No one should go to bed on an empty stomach.”</p><p>Kang looked up as Kirk walked over, Rarity in tow. “Ah, Kirk. Your legendary charm appears to be in action once more.”</p><p>Kirk waved him off. “Not this time, Kang. Although you seem to have a... good rapport forming with the Equestrians yourself.”</p><p>Kang grunted. “Applejack has strong ties to her family, and wishes to bring them honor. Both she and Fluttershy recognize the realities of nature. Red tooth and claw. Quite the Klingon mindset, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Perhaps, Kang... but those qualities aren't... <i>exclusive</i> to the Klingons. The Federation values family, and we too recognize the realities of nature. You're not so different from the Equestrians, but neither are we.” The ghost of a smile crossed his lips. “Perhaps, perhaps <i>we're</i> not so different, either.”</p><p>Kang leaned his head back. “I have respect for you, Kirk, but I doubt we have <i>that</i> much in common.”</p><p>Kirk shrugged. “Oh, I don't know. Two starship captains, representing the best of our two governments. We came together once, Kang. Who says we can't... do it again?”</p><p>There was a pause. Kang shifted his stance, but kept his eyes on Kirk, his expression neutral. “Extraordinary circumstances, Kirk. One that might not come again.”</p><p>Applejack stood up on her hind legs and held her forelegs out. “Okay, you two. I'm not exactly up to date on... galactic politics or anything like that, but I do know a thing or two about two people who think they've got nothing in common, but can still get along despite, or even <i>because</i> of that.” She dropped back down to all fours, her gaze lingering on Rarity. “And trust me, it's <i>very</i> worth it.”</p><p>Rarity giggled. “Take it from her, gentlemen. She <i>is</i> the Element of Honesty, after all.”</p><p>Kang opened his mouth, but stopped. His brow wrinkled. “Element... of Honesty?”</p><p>Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack all looked at each other. “Ah, horse apples!” Applejack said, rolling her eyes. “Sorry, Captain. We got kinda caught up there a bit in the small stuff.” She waved a hoof at the other two. “Rarity's the Element of Generosity, and Fluttershy's the Element of Kindness.” At their blank expressions, she sighed. “You got no idea what we're talking about, do you.”</p><p>Kirk's jaw worked for a moment. “Are these... ceremonial positions in your government? Do these titles carry actual weight?”</p><p>Rarity spoke up. “Actually, Applejack, with the Elements in the Tree of Harmony, are we <i>really</i> the Elements of Harmony anymore?” At Applejack's glare, she chuckled nervously. “W-well, all right!”</p><p>Kang walked up to Kirk's side. “I have a feeling neither of our briefings fully prepared us for this, Kirk.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “I have a feeling you're right, Kang.” He looked around the room. “Has anyone... seen Twilight?”</p><p>Applejack shrank down slightly. “W-well, she had to go take check on Spike, then write a... a letter to a friend.” Her eyes shifted from Kirk to Kang. “It's the honest-to-Celestia truth, I swear!”</p><p>Kirk glanced to a door near the back. “And this Spike is, Applejack?”</p><p>Rarity spoke up. “He's Twilight's assistant, and quite the dashing dragon, if I do say so.”</p><p>Kirk's eyes widened. “A... an actual <i>dragon</i>?”</p><p>Fluttershy nodded. “That's right, Captain. Twilight hatched his egg when she applied for Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, and they've been together ever since.”</p><p>Kang looked to Kirk. “Is there a problem? You look as if Kahless himself has appeared before you.”</p><p>Kirk looked to him, then back to Rarity and Fluttershy. “Just... <i>remembering</i> something I said during a log entry.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight and Spike made their way to a room in the castle. Spike had a basket of gems slung around one arm, and he occasionally tossed a ruby or emerald into his mouth. “I don't think Sunset's got any information on these guys,” he said between chewing and swallowing. “Don't they have like, only a few space stations in orbit or something? Oh, and thanks for the gems!”</p><p>Twilight glanced back as they entered the room and stood before a large mirror and a techno-magical contraption surrounding it. “First off, thank <i>you</i> for doing all that hard work. And second, good point. I just wanna make sure all the bases are covered. You never know.” She turned back to the mirror and a book floated up and over to her. A quill and inkwell floated over and she began to write in it:</p><p><i>Dear Sunset Shimmer</i><br/><i>Hello. I hope things are going well for you over at Canterlot High. I apologize for not writing lately, but it's been a busy couple of weeks. A probe from outer space crashed down outside of Ponyville, and we've had contact with people from the stars!</i></p><p><i>The beings who landed here bear quite a striking resemblance to the humans where you live. It piqued my curiosity. Do the names 'James T. Kirk', 'Spock', or 'United Federation of Planets' sound</i><i> familiar to you at all</i><i>? Any information would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.</i></p><p><i>Twilight Sparkle</i></p><p>Spike spoke up as Twilight set the book back. “So, do we wait?”</p><p>Twilight chuckled and shook her head. “Probably not a good idea to keep our guests waiting too long. Faust knows what Sunset's doing right now.” She waved Spike closer to her as her horn lit up. “Speaking of which, ready to meet the captains?”</p><p>Spike nodded, grinning. He raised a claw. “Hey, think I could get a tour of their ships?”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Let's not get <i>too</i> ahead of ourselves.” Her horn flared as she teleported them both out of the room.</p><p>As soon as Twilight and Spike left, words started to appear on the book's pages...</p><p><i>Ha ha, Twilight. How did you find out 'Star Trek' was one of my favorite shows?</i></p><hr/><p>Twilight and Spike reappeared right outside the front hall. They entered, finding Kirk and Kang surrounded by every other guest. Several other Ponyville residents had wandered in and listened as the two captains spoke, their voices rising and lowering.</p><p>Kirk held up his right hand and waved it about. “We... <i>work together</i>, Kang, for the good of all! All members of the Federation,” he clasped his hands together, “for the good of <i>all</i>!”</p><p>Kang snarled. “I will not apologize for my people being invaded and our planet plundered by the Hur'q! They left us stripped of almost everything but our honor. We <i>had</i> to strike out for our very survival! Do you deny our right to exist?”</p><p>Kirk rounded on him. “I am not denying your right to survive, Kang. What I <i>do</i> deny is your right to survive at the expense of others. Humans have found a way to coexist and cooperate within the Federation.”</p><p>Kang shook his head. “Would you be able to, if the Vulcans had come to conquer, instead of to help?”</p><p>Kirk opened his mouth, but any rejoinder died on his lips.</p><p>Twilight walked up and cleared her throat, gaining their attention. “Are you two all right?”</p><p>Kang's head shot down. “An old argument, Princess Sparkle. It's one our nations have had for a long time.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “I... apologize if the arguing got out of hand, Twilight. Both Kang and I can be rather... <i>passionate</i> about our views.”</p><p>“I would not respect you if you held back, Kirk,” Kang said, half-smiling.</p><p>Twilight motioned to Spike. “Well, I <i>would</i> like to introduce you two to my assistant and best friend, Spike the dragon.”</p><p>Spike stepped forward, straightened to attention and saluted. “Reporting for duty, Captains!” He leaned forward, grinning. “And maybe a ride on one of your ships?”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Spike!”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “Quite bold for one so young and small. Yes, Spike. Barring any problems, I'll give you and Princess Sparkle a tour of the <i>Pride</i>.”</p><p>Twilight's ears perked up and her wings fluttered. “Wait, really?”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Well, I'd be... remiss if I didn't offer a tour of the <i>Enterprise</i> as well, for you and perhaps small groups as well.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's head shot up. “Wait, wait... a tour of your ships? Up there, in outer space?”</p><p>Kirk and Kang exchanged a look. “Well, yes,” Kirk said. “If you'd like to go, that–”</p><p>Rainbow Dash flew up to his head, then over to Kang's. “Count me in!”</p><p>Kang eyed her. “Enthusiastic. I like you!”</p><p>Kirk knelt down to Twilight and Spike. “If I may ask, Twilight, Applejack mentioned you were writing a letter to a friend. Anything... wrong?”</p><p>Twilight's brow furrowed. “I don't... think so? I just needed to touch base with a friend of mine in an alternate dimension.”</p><p>Kirk shot back to his feet. “An... alternate dimension?!”</p><p>Twilight scooted back slightly. “Y-yeah. Is that a... a problem, Captain?”</p><p>Kang leaned in close. “Kirk, you've gone quite pale.”</p><p>The other ponies gathered closer to Kirk, their expressions of concern for him. Pinkie Pie shot off, returning with a mug of cider balanced on her head. She bounced, sending it up and over to Kirk.</p><p>Kirk caught the mug and took a long swig from it. “Thank you, Pinkie. I... apologize for that. Two years ago, I was... sent to an alternate dimension, thanks to a transporter accident, along with Uhura, Bones, and Chief Engineer Scott. We were transported to a warped, distorted version of the Federation called the Terran Empire.” He looked to Kang. “It reminded me a bit of what Mara told me about your... information concerning the Federation.”</p><p>Kang chuckled. “A good point, Captain.”</p><p>He looked back to Twilight. “We managed to escape by the skin of our teeth, our counterparts returning at the same time. It was... sobering, to see the worst that could happen.”</p><p>Applejack looked to Twilight. “That doesn't sound like what you described Canterlot High as, Twilight. Still...”</p><p>Kirk held his hands up, palms out. “I... apologize if I've caused undue worry, Twilight. I merely hope your friend is all right.”</p><p>Twilight and Spike looked to each other, then back up at Kirk. “Last time we checked...” Spike said. “Twilight, you think maybe we should go check on the journal again?”</p><p>Twilight held up a foreleg. “Let's... not jump to any conclusions, Spike.” A small bit of her mane sprang up. “No, no jumping to <i>any</i> conclusions that–”</p><p>Spike placed a hand over her muzzle and squeezed it shut. “That's right, Twilight. <i>No</i> jumping to conclusions in front of the nice captains!”</p><p>Twilight nodded. She waited for Spike to let go, then looked up to the Kirk and Kang. “So, gentlemen, again, apologies for the delay. Would you still like a brief tour of the castle before tonight's dinner?”</p><p>Kang nodded. “A brief tour, Princess.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “I'd be... honored.”</p><hr/><p>“... And here is the cutie mark map room. It's where my friends and I meet, discuss important matters, and even get missions from the map itself.”</p><p>Twilight led the two into the room. She flew up and around the table and waved at the seven chairs. “One chair each for my fellow Elements of Harmony, and one for Spike.”</p><p>Kang leaned in close to Kirk. “Is it my imagination, or does this castle seem a bit... bigger on the inside than the outside?”</p><p>Kirk glanced at him out of the corner of his eyes. “Now that you mention it...”</p><p>The two walked over to the crystalline table. As Twilight dropped onto her chair, a holographic map of Equestria appeared. “If there's a friendship problem in Equestria, the map lights up, and the cutie marks of the ponies best suited to go and solve the problem float over wherever it is that need our help.”</p><p>Kang hovered over the map, eyes darting back and forth. “Kirk, how much of that did you understand?”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted slightly. “Most of it, Kang. I... think.” He looked to Twilight. “What is a... cutie mark?”</p><p>Twilight blinked. She groaned and slapped her forehead with a hoof. “Ho, boy! This is gonna take some... time.” She floated up and turned around slightly to present her flank to the two. “All right, see this symbol, here? It's my cutie mark. It represents a pony's special talent, what they like doing best. Most of the time it's pretty straightforward, but not all the time.”</p><p>Kang leaned forward. “Is it some sort of dye? Is there a certain age you receive it? Are there trials to find your special talent?”</p><p>Twilight's brow furrowed slightly. “Well, no. It just... shows up when you realize what you want to do with your life. It's not a dye, and while it usually shows up when you're a foal, it doesn't always happen that way.” She rubbed her chin. “Darn it, there's so many gaps in our knowledge of each other! I tried to fill the first-contact teams in as much as I could, but there were just so many things that came to mind!” Her horn flashed. A scroll, quill and inkwell appeared in front of her. “Hmm, where to start on <i>this</i> list?”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Twilight, I think, at the moment, any explanation would... not be adequate, and leave gaps. Perhaps at a later time, when you're more fully prepared? It would be better for you to... think it over a bit.”</p><p>Twilight slowly nodded. “Okay, that makes sense.” She hung her head. “I apologize for acting like that. Sometimes stress can lead me to a bit of rambling, taking action before I've fully thought things out. It's a weakness of mine, and I still haven't fully gotten over it.”</p><p>Kang smiled. “One's heart can be quite powerful and overriding, Princess. The challenge is taming your passions and directing them towards your goal.” The smile fell away. “Not all Klingons have mastered it.”</p><p>Kirk looked to him. “Not all <i>humans</i> have, either.”</p><p>Twilight's ears perked up. “Oh, really? Both your people have that in common?” Her eyes sparkled slightly. “What about you two? You seem rather... in control of yourselves. Almost... friendly.”</p><p>Kang growled. “I have respect for Kirk, Princess. He is honorable, and I owe him. Friendship, however, is not something I would claim with him.”</p><p>Kirk thumped his chest. “Kang, I'm hurt!”</p><p>Twilight flew up, around and over to the two. “Well, it <i>is</i> fairly obvious in hindsight that you're not exactly on friendly terms. I think, though, that you two have a lot in common, that you can build on it to a genuine friendship.” She drew her wings out around them. “What do you say? Care to give friendship a chance?”</p><p>Kang stared at her for a moment before raising his hand, blocking her wing from coming any closer. “You overreach yourself, Princess. Friendship is... not something I can see myself having with Kirk. I respect him, I find him to be an honorable opponent, even. But friendship?” He slowly shook his head. “Impossible.”</p><p>Kirk regarded him. “Kang, I've learned the 'impossible' is not nearly as absolute a term as I once thought it was.”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “It's true, Kang. I've made friends with a lot of people I never in a million moons I thought I would. It's not easy, but it's worth it.” She slowly extended a foreleg. “Would you... consider it?”</p><p>Kang's eyes narrowed. He activated his communicator. <i>“Pride, </i>one to beam up.” He looked over and locked eyes with Twilight. “Thank you for the tour, Princess. It was most... informative.” He glanced down. “Energize.” A swirl of red energy surrounded him as he disappeared.</p><p>Twilight hung in midair, staring at the spot Kang occupied. She slowly dropped down into her throne and rested her forelegs on the table. “Captain Kirk, I've heard a <i>bit</i> about how bad it's been between the Federation and Klingon Empire.” She looked up at him. “Even near-war a few times?”</p><p>Kirk knelt down. “You are... correct, Twilight. It <i>has</i> been bad, on the brink of war more than once. The Broken Bow incident was... not the best way first-contact could have gone. There have been a few bright spots, but not many.”</p><p>Twilight massaged her forehead. “Friendship problems between two people, or even groups of people, are one thing. But interstellar nations is a whole other league.”</p><p>Kirk shrugged. “Well, Kang and I are individuals. Perhaps you should start small, for now? Another old saying is that the longest journey begins with... one step.”</p><p>Twilight slowly nodded, her expression brightening. “Captain, I think you're right.” She flew up and turned to face him. “I'm gonna take that small step, and maybe a few more!” Her horn lit up. “If you'll excuse me, Spike and I have a lot to do before that dinner tonight.” And with that, she vanished.</p><p>Kirk chuckled. He slid his communicator from his belt. <i>“Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>“<i>Enterprise, Lieutenant M'ress here, Captain.”</i></p><p>Kirk paused for a moment. “Where's... right, getting ready for the dinner. One to beam up, Lieutenant.”</p><hr/><p>Canterlot Castle's main hall had hosted many functions over the years, but none of them seemed to hold as much weight as the one being held that night. Dignitaries, bureaucrats, royalty, Klingons and humans were scattered all about, servants darting back and forth with trays of food and drink. Several groups clustered around buffet tables while Octavia Philharmonic and her band played on the main stage.</p><p>Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of his command staff walked in, all in dress uniform. A page at the door looked up at him. “Announcing Captain James T. Kirk, Commander Spock, Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, Lieutenant Commander Hikaru Sulu, Lieutenant Commander Nyota Uhura, and Lieutenant Pavel Chekov of the USS <i>Enterprise!”</i></p><p>The guests all turned, a hush settling over the crowd. Kirk flashed a smile as several ponies approached. He knelt down slightly as they chatted with him, smiling and trying to commit their faces and names to memory, at least for the course of the evening.</p><p>The now-familiar voice of Twilight caught his attention. He looked up and spotted the Princess flying over, now dressed in regalia more fitting the occasion. “Your majesty,” he said, bowing slightly.</p><p>Twilight chuckled. She sketched a midair bow to him and the others. “Good to see you.” She waved a wing at the tables. “We've had the finest chefs in Equestria working all day to make this.”</p><p>Kirk nodded to her. “And we... appreciate the effort, Princess.” He turned to the others. “You've met Spock, Bones, and Uhura. Allow me to introduce–”</p><p>“Hikaru Sulu, chief helmsman, Pavel Chekov, navigator, and Montgomery Scott, chief engineer?” At their stares, she shrank down slightly. “Sorry. I did a bit more research this afternoon and found out your positions.” She leaned in close to Kirk. “You weren't kidding about it being bad between your two governments.”</p><p>Kirk turned to the others. “Hikaru, Pavel, Scotty, this is Princess Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship for Equestria.”</p><p>Chekov tilted his head back slightly and smiled. “Ah, Princess of Friendship! Must've inherited the title from Anastasia, of the Romanov's!”</p><p>Twilight blinked. She leaned in close to Chekov. “Sorry, what? Who?”</p><p>Scotty patted Chekov on the shoulder. “Now, now, lad. Let's not confuse her <i>too</i> much.” He stepped around him and bowed slightly to Twilight. “Honored to meet you, your highness. Montgomery Scott, but you can call me 'Scotty'.”</p><p>Twilight bit her lip. “It's an honor to meet you as well, Scotty.” She giggled slightly. “I just realized. You're the... the chief engineer of the <i>Enterprise</i>. You run the warp engines that enable your ship to go faster-than-light. I have... <i>so</i> many questions I want to ask you right now. But if I start, I may not stop! I mean, how the engines can overcome the light-speed barrier without infinite energy, for one.”</p><p>Scotty grinned. “Ah, I think you and I will get along <i>just</i> fine, your highness!”</p><p>Movement from Kirk's left caught his eye. He turned as Kang, Mara, and Kina walked over, all three clad in a dress uniform that was more armor than cloth. Kirk nodded to the three. “Enjoying yourselves?”</p><p>Kina grunted. “The food is... surprisingly good. And the Equestrians themselves are... not as annoying as I thought they'd be.” He leaned in close. “Their soldiers, though?” He barked a laugh. “My grandmother in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i> would be able to best all of them!”</p><p>Kang glanced at him out of the corner of his eyes. “Do not underestimate them, Kina. You and I both know how deceiving appearances can be.”</p><p>Kirk looked to Mara. “I haven't had a chance to get more than the barest briefing from Spock about his research. What progress have you made?”</p><p>Mara looked to Spock, even as the Vulcan broke from the others and stepped towards them. “Our scans have detected gravimetric distortions from the planet to the sun, along with some other unknown form of radiation. We believe that's how Celestia controls the sun. ”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Mara is correct, Captain. We have also theorized she, Luna and Cadance are part of a race of energy beings similar to that of the Organians, and others we have encountered over the past three years.”</p><p>Kirk rubbed his chin. He looked over, spotting Twilight and now Rainbow Dash chatting with Scotty and Sulu, then turned back and leaned in. His voice dropped as he spoke. “What about Twilight? Is she... <i>evolving</i> into this next stage of their development? And if she can, what about other ponies?”</p><p>Mara growled. “All things are possible until they are not, Kirk. I am tempted to ask Princess Sparkle, but Spock and I agree to... tread lightly for the moment.”</p><p>Kang nodded to her. “A wise decision, my wife. Only a fool fights the storm.”</p><p>Kina's eyes darted back and forth as everyone looked to him. “I'm a warrior, but no fool,” he said. “I'm just not sure about the rest of the crew, or the Empire itself.”</p><p>Kang crossed his arms. “They are not here. <i>I</i> am, Commander. And I will take the responsibility for the decisions made.”</p><hr/><p>Rainbow Dash crossed her forelegs as she hovered in front of Sulu. “So, you fly the ship?”</p><p>Sulu grinned. “That's right, Miss Dash. Well, Pavel and I work together. It's a complicated procedure, flying a starship at warp eight.”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin. “Actually, I've been meaning to ask you how the warp scale measures your speed.”</p><p>Scotty spoke up. “You cube the warp factor, and that's how many times the speed of light the <i>Enterprise</i> goes, lassie. Warp one is the speed of light itself. Warp two is eight times the speed of light, warp three twenty-seven times the speed of light, and so on. Under normal power, we can get up to warp eight, or five hundred-twelve times the speed of light.” His smile widened. “Or ninety-five million, three hundred-twenty thousand miles per second.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's jaw dropped and her wings extended. “I... I... I can't wait to go up there for that tour Captain Kirk mentioned.”</p><p>Sulu leaned forward. “Well, if you'd like, I'm certain I can <i>also </i>arrange for a trip on one of our shuttles. It's not as fast as the <i>Enterprise</i>, but she'll be in standard orbit for most of this mission.”</p><p>Twilight leaned forward. “Tell me, Mister Sulu. How many ponies–I mean passengers–can this shuttle carry at one time?”</p><p>Sulu grinned. “You're more than welcome to join us, your highness.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash held up a foreleg and waved it about. “I call shotgun!” At everyone's stares, she shrugged. “Well, I <i>was</i> offered first.”</p><p>Any further discussion died as the main doors opened. Celestia, Luna, and Cadance walked in, a page announcing their arrival. As they strode in, every pony dropped to one knee and bowed their heads. Even Rainbow Dash and Twilight dropped to the ground and bowed.</p><p>Celestia walked up to Kirk and Kang. “Welcome back, captains!” She looked to the window, just as the sun dropped below the horizon. “How has your stay here been so far?”</p><p>Kirk and Kang exchanged a glance. “It's been... educational,” Kirk said, holding up a hand. “I must admit, we've learned that there is... so much more to <i>learn</i> about your planet. About your culture and people. As my first officer would say, it's been... interesting so far.”</p><p>Kang nodded. “I will agree with Kirk about seeing how much we have to learn. Personally, I was not sure <i>what</i> to expect here, but it has been rather enlightening for me.”</p><p>Luna walked up to Celestia's side and locked eyes with Kang. “Enlightenment is a rare and precious gift, Captain Kang. I am glad to hear you've attained it.”</p><p>Kang returned the stare and smiled. “I <i>do</i> seem to find myself more thoughtful than normal around Kirk.”</p><p>Celestia smiled. “I hope your crews find Equestria to be just as enlightening as you have.” She swept a wing towards the buffet tables. “Please enjoy yourselves. Our finest chefs have worked their hardest on these meals.”</p><p>Kang turned to face Kirk. “And now our real battle begins, Kirk. I shall do my utmost to win their alliance.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “I'd be insulted if you did less than your best, Kang.” He paused for a moment, then thumped his chest. “Good luck.”</p>

<p>Uhura stood in front of a large mural, her eyes narrow as she took in every detail of it, from the armor-clad ponies jousting, to the archaic script that twisted and flowed along its edges. She raised a finger to it, stopping just short of touching the paint. “Let me see, here. 'And the brave knights strode forth to battle the Ursa Minor.'” Her eyes flicked up. “Ah, star bear.” She paused. “Wait, 'star bear'?”</p><p>“Is there something amiss?”</p><p>Uhura turned around at the voice. She glanced down, spotting a unicorn stallion and unicorn mare standing behind her. The stallion wore a suit jacket and tie, with a monocle that floated a few inches above his muzzle. The mare was lanky, almost willowy, and carried herself with an aura of confidence and grace.</p><p>The stallion bowed his head. “Ah, terribly sorry, Commander Uhura. How rude of me.” He extended a foreleg. “My name is Fancy Pants. My wife Fleur Dis Lee and I couldn't help but overhear you.” His monocle swung around and floated up towards the mural itself. “Ah, I remember this one! From the era of the Three Tribes. Sir Bill the Brave, if I'm not mistaken.”</p><p>Uhura looked back to the mural. “Ah, yes. Sir Bill the Brave, and his good friends, Sam the Wise and Frozen Door. It reads that they fought a 'star bear'. Do you have any idea what they could be referring to?”</p><p>Fancy Pants' monocle swiveled to face Uhura. “My dear, are you actually able to <i>read </i>that?”</p><p>Uhura nodded. “Well, it's a little difficult, Mister...”</p><p>Fancy Pants chuckled. “Oh, just call me Fancy Pants. But as I was saying, you're really able to read that?”</p><p>Uhura rubbed her chin. “Well, there's more than a bit of extrapolation. From my research, your modern language appears to be a merger of several languages, related but still distinct from one another.”</p><p>Fleur nodded. “The languages of the Three Tribes merged together after the first Hearth's Warming. There are still some terms distinctive to pony type, but by and large we all speak the same language.”</p><p>Uhura nodded. “That makes sense–horns and wings <i>would </i>leave some lingering slang and phrases. There’s also how your senses would differ. Pegasi and wind currents, unicorns and their horns, and earth ponies and hooves”</p><p>Fancy Pants' brow furrowed. “Tell me, how long have you been able to study our language?”</p><p>Uhura shrugged. “Oh, not long. Maybe three or four hours, when I wasn't helping Doctor McCoy with some of his medical examinations.”</p><p>Fancy Pants and Fleur stared up at Uhura, mouths agape. “T-three or four hours?” Fancy Pants asked.</p><p>Uhura sighed. “Admittedly, it's not my usual speed. I'm still a little iffy on vocalization. There are some structural differences between our throats, for example, that make it difficult.”</p><p>Fleur leaned forward. “Is there... any chance we could hear you speak without those machines we've heard of?” She held up a hoof. “I swear, we won't laugh.”</p><p>Uhura glanced down, her eyes half-closed. She suddenly looked up, pressed the fingers of her right hand to her throat, and began to speak. Melodious words came out, rising and falling in pitch. [Hello I am happy to be speak-singing with you. The eels of the Federation of Worlds say hello!] She stopped speaking, her brow furrowed. “Wait a minute... no. I think I said 'eels' there, didn't I.”</p><p>Fancy Pants bit his lip, but the mildest of chuckles came out. He waved a foreleg in the air. “My apologies, Commander,” he finally said, his cheeks turning red. “In all seriousness, that you can actually read <i>and </i>speak our language so well after a few hours of study is remarkable!”</p><p>Uhura flashed a brilliant smile at him. “Thank you, Fancy Pants.” She looked back to the mural. “So... 'star bear'? Would you happen to know what that would refer to?”</p><p>Fleur trotted up to the mural and looked the images over. “Well, it's probably referring to the tale of their fight against an Ursa Minor. I seem to recall reading about that in school, but for the life of me I can't recall the exact details.”</p><p>Uhura looked from the mural to Fleur. “So, this is an actual animal that's native to the planet?”</p><p>Fleur nodded, smiling. “Oh, yes. They spend a lot of time hibernating, but if you wake one up, it can get <i>very </i>nasty very quickly. Last time I heard about one being woken up was about...” She looked to Fancy Pants. “Four years ago, in Ponyville?”</p><p>Fancy Pants nickered. “Ah, yes. I remember reading about that little incident in the next day's briefings. Ponyville was <i>very </i>lucky Princess Sparkle was there to placate it and send it back to its mother.”</p><p>Uhura looked at the writing on the mural and squinted. “This mentions something about a major problem. Wait, no. Not a problem. A larger... is that mentioning another bear?”</p><p>Fancy Pants chuckled lightly. Yes, it's referring to the adult form of the bear, the Ursa <i>Major</i>. That one can cradle the Ursa Minor like a mother would cradle their foals. Positively gargantuan!”</p><p>Fleur shuddered and kicked at the floor. “I'm not sure anyone's seen an Ursa Major in living memory, barring either Celestia or Luna. And I'm fairly sure that's a good thing, too” She looked to Uhura. “Have you encountered any large beasts in your travels among the stars?”</p><p>Uhura nodded, half-smiling. “Oh, there have been a few here and there. Some were friendly, others not so much.” Her head rose as the band started playing once more. “What lovely music!”</p><p>Fancy Pants and Fleur followed her gaze. “Ah, yes, Octavia Philharmonic,” Fleur said. “One of the rising stars in the Canterlot music scene. She's quite brilliant and skilled.”</p><p>Uhura and the two ponies started moving towards the stage. By then Octavia's bow moved furiously across the strings, her head down and movements precise. Her bandmates somehow managed to keep up, all their movements in sync as they produced beautiful music.</p><p>Uhura slowly knelt down and leaned in close to Fancy Pants. “Pardon me for asking, but how does she hold onto the bow with hooves?” She looked back up at the band. “Or for that matter, manipulate the strings?”</p><p>Fancy Pants chuckled. He held up his own foreleg and waved it back and forth. “An earth pony channels their magic not through a horn or wings, but through their hooves. They're also quite a bit more flexible than they appear to be.”</p><p>The band finished their piece. Uhura stood up and clapped, while the others around her stomped their hooves. Very quickly, she stomped her a foot up and down.</p><p>Another unicorn mare walked over to Uhura's side opposite Fancy Pants and Fleur and looked down at her feet. “I say, how <i>do </i>you manage to keep your balance like that?”</p><p>Uhura stopped stomping in applause. “Oh, it's not that hard, Miss...”</p><p>The mare chuckled and bowed her head. “My apologies, Miss Uhura. I'm Lyrica Lilac. It's a pleasure to meet you.” She glanced at the mural. “I overheard you speaking our language. Remarkable!”</p><p>Uhura knelt down to Lyrica's level. She held out her fist, allowing Lyrica to bump it. “Thank you. Please call me Nyota. Hopefully over the next few days I can figure out how to say the word 'worlds' instead of 'eels'.”</p><p>Lyrica opened her mouth, silent for a moment, before laughing. “I look forward to that! And please, call me Lyrica.”</p><p>Fancy Pants walked forward and turned to face Lyrica. “Enjoying yourself, my dear?”</p><p>Lyrica smiled as she regarded Fancy Pants. “Quite so, dear Fancy. I must admit, I'm rather concerned about being stuck between the Federation and Klingon Empire.” Her head shot up. “Ah... no offense, Nyota. But it's still a bit... nerve-wracking.”</p><p>Uhura let out a sigh. “I can't blame you for that, Lyrica. Even the current cold war between our governments can flare up. I can only assure you, the Federation will respect any decisions made by your government.”</p><p>Lyrica nodded slightly. “Thank you, Nyota, for that. I only hope the Klingons will respect it, too.”</p><p>Uhura's eyes lifted and she focused on a group of Klingons near the stage, looking up as Octavia began another song. “Well, Kang will. And if they're smart and don't want their fleets swallowed by a solar flare, they'll abide, too.”</p><hr/><p>Scotty, Chekov, and Sulu walked up to a buffet table. Scotty looked over a punch bowl filled with cider and groaned. “Ach, this is ridiculous! Don't they have anything stronger than this dressed-up water?” He unclipped a flask from his kilt's sporran, unscrewed the stopper and took a swig. “Ah, now that's better!”</p><p>Chekov rolled his eyes. “Bah, whiskey? Little old ladies in Leningrad brew that. They need vodka!”</p><p>Sulu slapped his forehead. “Do you two <i>have </i>to do this every time alcohol's involved?”</p><p>Scotty waved him off. “'Tis a matter of pride, Sulu! I won't have that mother's milk touted over the finest liquor in the galaxy!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash flew over and jabbed a hoof at Scotty's flask. “Hey, what's in that?”</p><p>Scotty and Chekov looked to each other. Scotty held up the flask and looked it over. “This, lassie, is whiskey. It's a might stronger than the cider in that bowl.”</p><p>Chekov rubbed his chin. “Miss Dash, do you think you could help Mister Scott and I in an experiment?”</p><p>Sulu interjected himself between Rainbow Dash and his fellow officers. “Okay, now hold on, you two. You are <i>not </i>getting anyone drunk in order to settle this damned grudge between you.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash groaned. “Okay, <i>fine</i>! Listen, there's a bar at the edge of Ponyville called the Punch Bowl. I'll be done my weather-patrol duties tomorrow by about one o'clock, so why not stop by there a little after with whatever you've got? Hay, I’ll even pick up Applejack. This Cider <i>is </i>from Sweet Apple Acres.”</p><p>Scotty rubbed his chin. “Well, I think I can swing by after visiting that rock farm or whatever it was with Ensign Naraht. All right, lassie. You got yourself a deal.” He turned to Chekov. “Unless you're afraid, Mister Chekov, of finally being proven wrong?”</p><p>Chekov scowled. “<i>Nyet</i>, Mister Scott!”</p><p>A small group of Klingons walked over. “Whiskey? Vodka? Why not let her and the others taste some real drinks?” the leader, a rather stocky Klingon with a bald head but rather thick beard, said. “I have a vat of blood wine aboard the <i>Pride</i>, and I will place that against anything you two earthers bring down from the <i>Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>Scotty sidestepped Sulu and approached the Klingons. “Aye, lad? Yah think so?”</p><p>The Klingon held up a hand. “Let us not get violent here, Mister Scott, or at this Punch Bowl. I was one of the survivors of Captain Kang's former command, the <i>Voh'tahk</i>. Let us wage our battle with drinks this time around.”</p><p>Scotty looked to Sulu, then Chekov, then back to the Klingon and smiled. “Aye, I think that'd be a wonderful idea...”</p><p>“Kellett, son of Grix,” he said. “Chief engineer of the <i>K'naiah's Pride</i>.”</p><p>Scotty leaned his head back slightly. “An honor to meet you, Mister Kellett.” He looked to Rainbow Dash. “Any objections, Miss Dash?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash shook her head. “No way, Mister Scott.” She rubbed her front hooves together and cackled. “I'm looking forward to this, now!”</p><p>Kellett exchanged a glance with his compatriots. Then tomorrow we meet on my... <i>preferred </i>field of battle.” He thumped his chest before turning and walking off.</p><p>Scotty leaned over and glanced back at Chekov. “Laddie, break out the saurian brandy. The pride of the <i>Enterprise </i>is on the line, and I'll be damned if we lose to the Klingons over this!”</p><hr/><p>Celestia, Luna and Twilight wandered through the main hall, their course seemingly random, but carefully laid out so they could see the maximum number of guests in the minimum amount of time. They exchanged small talk for the most part, some conversations taking a deeper turn. They eventually came upon Kirk, Spock, and Bones, the trio standing near a balcony. “Enjoying yourselves, gentlemen?”</p><p>Kirk looked up and raised a glass. “Quite an... informative party so far, your highness.” He motioned to Bones. “My chief medical officer's been filling me on on some examinations he's done on some of your citizens.” He then waved to Spock. “My first officer has also told me about some rather... <i>unique </i>properties of the Equus System, as compared to others we've been to.”</p><p>Luna laughed. “I presume you speak of it being a geocentric star system, as opposed to heliocentric?” She looked to Spock, her expression softening. “We've overheard your reluctance to broach the subject, Mister Spock. We appreciate your respect, but it is unnecessary. If you and Mara have questions, then please ask.”</p><p>Bones smirked behind a glass. “Might not want to have said that, Princess. Once Mister Spock gets started asking questions, we could be here all week.”</p><p>Spock rocked slightly on his heels. “I am sorry my curiosity upsets you, Doctor. Shall we use small words so as not to confuse you?”</p><p>Bones rolled his eyes. “Well, Mister Spock. That almost sounds like an emotional response. How very human of you.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “There is no need for insults, Doctor. I was merely inquiring how you wished for us to proceed.”</p><p>Twilight's head whipped back and forth between the two. “Are you two... really okay? You seem <i>really </i>argumentative, even more so than before.”</p><p>Kirk held his arms out. “You'll have to forgive them, Twilight. Bones and Spock mean well, but their personalities are so... extreme to each other, clashes are <i>inevitable </i>between them.”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin, her eyes still darting back and forth. “If you say so, Captain. Still, you two <i>did </i>seem to fall into arguing pretty quickly.”</p><p>Bones held up a hand. “Now, Princess, things might seem a bit extreme between Mister Spock and I, but in all honesty we <i>do </i>respect each other.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “That is true, Princess Sparkle. It is simply that I find Doctor McCoy to be somewhat... emotional. Vulcans pride themselves on emotional control. Logic and rational, controlled thought are among the cornerstones of our society.”</p><p>Bones smiled. “It's harmless overall, your highness. Nothing to worry about.”</p><p>Twilight eyed Bones and Spock. “Right, sure.” She stepped back and bowed her head. A clipboard and quill popped into existence in front of her face.</p><p>Bones stared at Twilight as she wrote. “Why did I just get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach?”</p><p>Luna slowly nodded as Spock spoke. “I… see.” At Bones’ look of confusion, she shrugged. “Such thoughts to rein in emotion like that are, admittedly, quite alien to Equestrians. We can be <i>very </i>expressive.” She bowed her head. “I hope this does not offend you, Mister Spock.”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “Negative, your highness. Vulcans practice a philosophy known as IDIC, or Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. We celebrate the vast array of variables in the universe.”</p><p>Spock looked to Celestia. “As I was about to begin, your highness, the setup of your solar system is geocentric, which goes against all known cosmological models of solar systems. Do you know how such a thing is possible? And if so, can you also illuminate us on how it came to be?”</p><p>Celestia nodded. “I would be happy to talk to you about that, Mister Spock.” She turned and looked over her shoulder, eyes narrowing as she scanned the crowd. “However, I don't think it would be fair to say anything without your Klingon counterparts here.”</p><p>While Celestia searched, Bones spoke up. “Begging your pardon, your highnesses, but I do have two questions, if I may.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “<i>You </i>have questions, Doctor?”</p><p>Bones ignored Spock as he continued. “Well, first off, the food's quite good. Compliments to your chefs. I was just curious, why such an informal setting?”</p><p>Luna turned partially around and extended a wing towards the main hall. “You mean, why buffett and no formal seating arrangement at tables? We Equestrians are communal. Most of the time, we feel better being able to mingle among our friends and family.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “That makes sense. On Earth, we too have horses. Non-sapient as compared to Equestrians. They're... <i>herd</i>-animals, tending to live in groups.”</p><p>Twilight looked up from her clipboard. “Sounds a lot like how we are, Captain. No matter what you're doing, it's more fun with a friend.”</p><p>Celestia let out a small gasp. “Ah, found them!” She waved a wing towards the far end of the room. Kang and Mara stood near a large painting, looking up at it. Mara would occasionally point at it, while Kang nodded every time she spoke.</p><p>Celestia looked to Luna, then the others. “If you'll excuse me, I'll go ask them to join us.” With that, she walked off.</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Fascinating. I would have expected her to send an aide to retrieve them, not go herself.”</p><p>Twilight grinned. “Princess Celestia likes to do things herself when possible. She doesn't like bothering others if it's something minor.”</p><p>Bones chuckled. “I knew there was something else I liked about her. Actually leads into my second question.”</p><p>Luna leaned her head forward slightly. “And what is this question, Doctor?”</p><p>Bones shrugged. “Well, just wondering why you're 'princesses' instead, I don't know, queen?”</p><p>Spock looked to him. “Interesting, Doctor. The same line of inquiry had also occurred to me.”</p><p>Bones barked a laugh and rocked on his heels. “Well, will wonders never cease?”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Indeed, Doctor. There may be hope for you, yet.”</p><p>Luna half-smiled, even as Twilight looked back to her clipboard and resumed writing. “Both Celestia and I feel that the title of 'queen' would put too much of a distance between ourselves and others. Princesses can walk amongst the populace with a modicum of closeness and familiarity. Queens cannot.”</p><p>Any further conversation was cut off as a loud <i>crash </i>echoed through the main hall, silencing the band and any conversation. All heads turned to a table near the center of the hall. Rarity and Blueblood stood there, Celestia, Kang and Mara right by them. A large platter of hors d'oeuvre was on the ground, scattered and splattered on the carpet. Several of them were also stuck to Rarity's dress and Blueblood's tuxedo.</p><p>Blueblood shuddered and patted his tuxedo down with his hooves. “Oh, you clumsy foal! You've ruined my suit!”</p><p>Rarity's right eye twitched. She ground her teeth together, the scrapping of enamel audible to everyone in the hall. She opened her mouth, and with an exaggerated politeness, said, “Oh, please forgive me, Prince Blueblood. I didn't see I stood still and you backed into me, knocking me into the table and sending the platter flying. How <i>clumsy </i>of me!”</p><p>Blueblood jabbed a hoof at Rarity. “Don't try and deflect any blame! I...” His eyes narrowed and he leaned in close, causing Rarity to lean away. “Wait, I think I know you. Haven't I seen you somewhere before?”</p><p>Rarity's left eye joined her right in the twitching. “You can't be serious.”</p><p>Celestia stepped forward and dipped her head. “Are you two all right?”</p><p>Kang scowled. He stepped up to Celestia's side and crossed his arms, but remained silent for the time-being.</p><p>Luna turned around to face the escalating situation. She slapped her face with a hoof and slowly dragged it down.</p><p>Kirk looked to Spock, then Bones. “If you'll excuse me,” he said before breaking from the group and walking over.</p><p>Bones reached out and grabbed Kirk by the arm. “Jim, what in God's name do you think you're gonna accomplish over there?”</p><p>Kirk shrugged him off. “Hopefully heading off an interstellar incident.” He tugged down on his shirt before continuing over. “Is... there a problem?”</p><p>Blueblood's head shot up and his eyes narrowed. “Of course there's a problem!” He suddenly gasped. “Wait, I <i>do </i>know you!”</p><p>Rarity let out a sigh. “Finally.”</p><p>“You're one of those miscreants who ruined the Grand Galloping Gala a few years ago!” His eyes narrowed. “You got cake all over my suit!”</p><p>Rarity's eyes widened. “W-w-what?!” She let out a growl, causing Blueblood to flinch. “<i>You </i>used me as a shield to block that cake in the first place. <i>And </i>you acted like a boorish oaf the entire evening!”</p><p>Kirk dropped to one knee and held out his hands. “Now, if you both calm down and take a step back, I think–“</p><p>Blueblood waved him off. “Captain, this is none of your concern.”</p><p>Rarity rolled her eyes. “Afraid of someone impartial, Blueblood? You and I both know how the honorable Captain Kirk would view this.” She looked over to him, expression softening. “Captain, you <i>do </i>believe I would never be the instigator in any sort of altercation, do you?”</p><p>Kirk hesitated for a moment. “Rarity, I <i>do </i>wish to believe you, but I haven't–“</p><p>Blueblood's cheeks flushed red. “Y-you would believe <i>her </i>over me? How dare you!” He spun to his left, dragged his hoof along the floor and snorted. “I am Prince Blueblood, and I will be given the respect I deserve!”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “Respect is earned, not given, 'Prince'. I believe Kirk is giving you all the respect you deserve.”</p><p>Kirk looked up at Kang. “Kang...”</p><p>Blueblood lowered his head and jabbed his horn in Kirk's direction. “You spurious <i>cur</i>! I will not be insulted by you!” He pulled out a handkerchief from a pocket with his magic and threw it at Kirk, smacking him in the chest with it. “I challenge you to a duel!”</p><p>Kirk looked down at the handkerchief, then up at Blueblood. “I... don't think that would be wise in this case, your highness. The negotiations between Equestria and the Federation!” He held out his hands. “Do you... <i>wish </i>to endanger them like this?”</p><p>Blueblood's cheeks turned red. “Bah, you coward!”</p><p>Kirk's gaze drifted to Kang and Mara, who were both watching with increasing interest. He looked to Celestia. “Your highness?”</p><p>Celestia let out a sigh. “Captain... Blueblood <i>is </i>within his right to challenge you like this. And there's nothing I, Luna, Cadance or Twilight can do about it. This dates back to the Three Tribes, and we agreed not to interfere in duels. If it makes it any easier, this won't affect any negotiations.”</p><p>Kang spoke up. “He challenged you, Kirk. The only honorable thing to do <i>is </i>accept!”</p><p>Kirk rubbed his forehead. “Very well.” He picked the handkerchief up. “I... accept.”</p><p>Murmuring broke out among the spectators. Blueblood nodded. “Very well. We'll meet in Canterlot Castle in two days' time. Ready yourself!” With that, he spun about and trotted off.</p><p>Spock and Bones ran over to Kirk's side, while Uhura, Chekov, Scotty and Sulu also arrived. “Jim, that was a <i>bad </i>idea,” Bones said. “A duel? And you accepted?”</p><p>Kang walked over. “He did the only thing a man such as he can, Doctor.” He patted Kirk on the shoulder, sending him stumbling a bit. “Teach that <i>targ </i>a lesson!”</p><p>Celestia walked up to Kirk. “I am <i>very </i>sorry about my nephew, Captain. Sometimes I think he has a bit of a chip on his shoulder.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Thank you, your highness. I will... keep that in mind.” He looked to his left. “Spock, I need everything you can dig up on these dueling traditions.”</p><p>Twilight teleported over. “Captain, may I be of assistance to Mister Spock? Duels nowadays are <i>very </i>rare, and I think he might need some assistance digging any information up in our libraries”</p><p>Kirk looked down and smiled. “Thank you, Twilight. That would be most... helpful. Mister Sulu, make sure all diplomatic and survey missions are continuing. I don't want any interruptions to our schedule. Commander Uhura, while you're not busy with their languages, please assist Spock and Twilight. I have a feeling your skills will be... most helpful.”</p><p>Bones spoke up. “And you, Jim?”</p><p>Kirk sighed and waved in the general direction of Blueblood's departure. “I'll be... trying to defuse the situation. Barring that, making sure I get out of this in one piece.” He looked around at his officers. “Dismissed.”</p>

<p><i>Captain's Log; supplemental. Negotiations have hit an unexpected snag. I have found myself locked in a... duel with one of the local aristocracy, a Prince Blueblood. Commanders Spock and Uhura are digging up anything they can on the ancient dueling traditions, aided ably by Princess Twilight Sparkle and her own assistant, Spike. Meanwhile, survey missions continue under Commander Sulu's supervision.</i></p><p><i>I am also continuing talks with the Princesses. Hopefully I will be able to...</i> defuse <i>the situation.</i></p><hr/><p>Spock sat at a table one of the Canterlot's Royal Library's study rooms, the table almost groaning with ancient tomes. He flicked through the pages, eyes missing nothing and brain categorizing everything he read.</p><p>Twilight walked over, three books floating beside her head. “Okay, I think this is everything the library's got on the ancient dueling traditions of the Unicorn Tribe.” She placed the books on the table. “Let's see, we've got 'The Dashing Duelist's Designs', Fencing for Fun and Faith', and 'Honorable Orneriness.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Fascinating.”</p><p>Twilight leaned forward. “What is?”</p><p>Spock picked up 'The Dashing Duelist's Designs' and opened it up. “Ninety-five point seven percent of all the books you have brought me have alliterative titles, your highness.”</p><p>Twilight slowly nodded. “Oh, right! It's a memory device to aid in remembering the titles. Complex spells have the same thing in <i>their </i>titles as well.” She chuckled. “It's so familiar to me, I gloss over it most of the time.”</p><p>Uhura walked over, her nose buried in a book. “Hmm, if I'm reading these and others right, Captain Kirk has the right to dictate what weapons used, as well as the rules.”</p><p>At that moment, Spike walked in, carrying a tray laden with mugs of coffee and setting it down on an end table. “Well, in that case, why not just use phasers at thirty paces and stun him with one shot?”</p><p>Uhura opened her mouth, but looked to Twilight before speaking. “Is that allowed?”</p><p>Twilight scratched her temple. “I... I don't see why not!” She suddenly groaned. “But then again, that would mean Blueblood would get a phaser, too.” She looked to Uhura's midsection and the phaser pistol hanging off of her belt. “How hard is it to learn how to use one of those things?”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “An admirable idea, Mister Spike, but Starfleet regulations forbid arming civilians with phaser weapons unless there is a dire need. I am afraid in this case, phasers cannot be used.”</p><p>Spike let out a groan and kicked at the floor. “Darn. Sorry, Mister Spock. Oh, and just call me Spike. No need for a 'mister' there.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “There is no need for apology, Spike. Your idea, in other circumstances, would work.”</p><p>Twilight walked over, leaned her head down and gently nuzzled him. “Spock's right, Spike. That <i>was </i>a pretty smart idea there.” She turned back to the main table, but a <i>giant </i>yawn escaped her lips. She blushed and floated a cup of coffee up to her mouth, taking a large gulp. “Sorry,” she said after swallowing, “I guess it's been a pretty long day for me.”</p><p>Uhura looked around, spotting a window. Night had fallen, and the full moon shone brightly in the sky. “Damn, where did the time go?”</p><p>Spock flipped through another book. “Commander, by my calculations, the <i>Enterprise </i>should be entering its night cycle. And you do have a tour of Ponyville tomorrow morning. Perhaps it would be best for you to return to the ship for rest.”</p><p>Spike and Twilight looked to Spock. “Well... what about you?” Spike asked. “Don't you need to sleep, too?”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “Negative. My Vulcan physiology allows me to perform multiple tasks for an extended period of time without rest or even the consumption of food. I shall stay and continue the research for thirty-three more minutes. Then I shall attend a meeting with the Princesses.”</p><p>Spike blinked. “Whoa, cool.” He looked to Twilight and waggled a claw at her. “Don't get any ideas, Twilight. You're <i>not </i>a Vulcan!”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “I know, Spike.” She dipped her head down and away from him. “Maybe that could change, though...”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Twilight's head shot back up. “Nothing, nothing!”</p><p>Uhura sighed. “Yes, Mister Spock is half-Vulcan. But as Doctor McCoy would remind you, you're <i>half</i>-human.” She held up a hand. “And no, that's not an insult, but a statement of fact.”</p><p>Spock nodded slightly. “You are correct, Commander. However, I am still far from exceeding my physical capabilities. And Captain Kirk still needs any and all information we can retrieve from these books.”</p><p>Twilight spoke up. “Well, there's one <i>big </i>piece of advice I can give about fighting unicorns.” She motioned to her horn. “No matter how powerful a unicorn is, he or she still needs to be able to concentrate to perform even basic telekinesis. Hay, I've had my own magic disrupted by loss of concentration.”</p><p>Uhura's face blossomed as she smiled. “That's a damned good piece of advice, Twilight.” She looked to Spock. “Maybe we should advise the Captain to have the rules be barehanded, or barehooved? Knowing him, he can get in close and punch that horn before Blueblood can do anything!”</p><p>Spike snapped his claws. “Yeah! That's a great idea, Commander!” He leaned back and punched the air. “Give him the old one-two!”</p><p>Spock bobbed his head slightly. “An interesting suggestion, and one I shall consider giving the Captain at the meeting.”</p><p>Twilight looked to the door. “Well, the librarian said you can stay here after-hours, Mister Spock. Just please make sure to sign out any books at the front desk, okay?”</p><p>Spock nodded to her. “I can assure you, your highness. I will make sure any and all books I take with me will be properly checked out before I return to the <i>Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>Spike looked to Twilight. “Hey, think we should check out if Sunset wrote back to you before bed?”</p><p>Twilight's eyes widened. She slapped herself in the forehead. “Oh, darn! I completely forgot about that!” Her horn glowed and Spike floated up onto her back. “If you two will excuse me, please?” Her horn flared, and she and Spike vanished.</p><p>Uhura unclipped her communicator from her belt and flipped it open. “<i>Enterprise</i>, one to beam up.” She looked to Spock. “I expect to see you back at the <i>Enterprise </i>sooner rather than later, Spock.” She looked back to the communicator. “Energize.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight and Spike reappeared in their castle, right in front of the mirror that led to the alternate reality. Spike hopped off of Twilight's back, but before he could say anything, he let out a <i>deep </i>yawn. He rubbed his eyes and scratched his back. “Twilight, is it okay if I hit the hay?”</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed and the door opened. “Go right ahead, Spike. And thank you again for all your hard work today. Sleep in tomorrow if you want, too.” She giggled as he hugged her, returning the embrace with her wings. They broke off and Spike walked out, waving to her even as he disappeared from view.</p><p>Twilight looked back to the mirror and book. Her horn glowed and the book floated over to her. Her brow furrowed as she read what was written in it. “Wait, what's this? What's 'Star Trek'? Who's 'William Shatner'?”</p><hr/><p>Captain Kirk leaned back, blinking slightly. He, Kang, and Mara sat with Celestia, Luna, and Cadance in some numbered conference room in Canterlot Castle. A magically-conjured map of the Equus System floated above the table. Celestia looked around the table before speaking. “Although I wish Mister Spock was here, I believe we <i>should </i>explain the unusual setup of our solar system sooner rather than later.” She looked to Kirk. “How long will he be at the library?”</p><p>Kirk opened his mouth, but any response was cut off as Spock materialized in the conference room. “I believe that answers your question, your highness.”</p><p>Spock stepped forward and bowed his head. “My apologies for my tardiness. I had several books checked out from the Royal Canterlot Library. I felt it prudent to bring them to the <i>Enterprise </i>first.”</p><p>Celestia's horn glowed and the final unoccupied seat slid out. “No problem, Mister Spock. I'm glad we're all here, now.” A small smile played at the corners of her lips. “And now, to sate your curiosity, our solar system.” She waved at the map, still floating above the table. “Yes, Luna and I control the movements of the celestial bodies around our planet. We use the gravimetric distortions you've undoubtedly detected to direct them.”</p><p>Mara leaned forward. “Your highness, those distortions aren't powerful enough to direct a star. However, there <i>is </i>another energy linking this planet to your sun and moon.”</p><p>Luna's right eyebrow quirked. “You're able to detect that?”</p><p>Mara's eyes widened. “You didn't expect us to?”</p><p>Luna shook her head. “There's no real scientific term for it. Consider it part of our essence, our soul.” She placed a hoof on her chest. “Celestia and I are not just what you see here. We have... evolved, beyond the physical.”</p><p>Kang clenched his hand into a fist and slammed it into the armrest. “Like the Organians, or the...” He snapped his fingers. “What was his name, Kirk, Trelane?”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Right, Kang.” He motioned to the map. “Your highness, is it <i>just </i>control, or do you and Luna... <i>embody </i>the sun and moon?”</p><p>Celestia nodded to him, her smile widening. “An apt analogy, Captain. Yes, Luna and I do more than just control the celestial bodies. We're part of them, and them, us.”</p><p>Spock leaned forward. “Control of them must be difficult.” At their looks, he shrugged. “The speed of light, your highnesses. By my calculations, it would take the light from the star approximately eight minutes, fifty-seven point nine seconds to reach Equus.”</p><p>Celestia chuckled. “What a precise approximation, Mister Spock.”</p><p>Kirk grinned. “I've found Mister Spock's approximations to be more accurate than other's concrete measurements.”</p><p>Mara spoke up. “I <i>have </i>found him rather knowledgeable as I've worked with him.”</p><p>Celestia waved a wing back at the map. “Well, since a part of me is in the sun, control is not as difficult as you'd think, Mister Spock. I–”</p><p>A voice boomed out in the room. <i>“Oh, come on, Celestia. Why all the boring technical babble? You use magic to control the sun, Luna the moon. Let's get onto the fun stuff, like Kirk in a shirtless fight with that boneheaded Blueblood!”</i></p><p>Kirk, Spock, Kang, and Mara all rose to their feet, looking around. Spock held his tricorder up and activated it, Mara following suit. “I am unable to detect the source of the voice, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk looked to the princesses, who were both blushing and shrinking down in their seats. “Something tells me you... weren't expecting anyone else showing up?”</p><p>Celestia groaned and leaned forward. “To be honest, I was wondering when you'd show up, Discord.”</p><p>Kang's hand went to the disruptor in his belt-holster. “'Discord'?”</p><p>A flash of light lit up the room as Discord teleported in, floating right in front of Kang. He bowed, spinning about in midair. “Why <i>hello</i>, Captain!” he stopped spinning and, upside down, extended a hand. “How positively delightful to meet you!”</p><p>Kang crossed his arms. “I presume you are Discord.” He looked him over. “What species <i>are </i>you?”</p><p>Discord rolled his eyes around in their sockets. “Oh, dear.” He rotated around once more, ending right-side up. “Although the technical term is draconequus, I don't like to limit myself in such a stultifying manner. I'm Discord. I'm unique!”</p><p>Luna rolled her eyes. “You're a royal pain in the flank.”</p><p>Discord turned and pointed at her, but stopped. “Eh... you've got a point, Lulu.” He snapped his claws. A lit cigar appeared in Luna's mouth, and a bottle of wine appeared on the table in front of her.</p><p>Celestia forced a brittle smile on her face. “Captains Kirk and Kang, Mister Spock and Miss Mara, this is Discord, a being that embodies chaos and randomness. Beyond that... he's somewhat hard to describe.”</p><p>Discord waved an arm in the air and bowed. “My dear Celestia, a higher compliment you cannot pay to me!”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted to the right. “Well, it's... certainly an interesting way to introduce yourself, Discord.”</p><p>Discord spun around to face Kirk, his head twisting around several-dozen times. He finally held his front limbs up and pressed them to the side of his head, stopping it. He turned his head to face Kirk. “My dear Captain Kirk, you have <i>no </i>idea how glad I am the Federation made contact when it did.”</p><p>Kirk looked Discord over. “Really?”</p><p>Discord nodded and leaned in close. “Dear Princess Sparkle was about to lock herself up in her castle's library with Spike and do some sort of <i>massive </i>reorganization or something for minuscule amounts of efficiency.” He rolled his eyes around in his head, the orbs falling out of his mouth, bouncing on the floor and back up into his eye sockets. “Chaos knows what I would've had to do then.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Fascinating, Captain. He does not register on my tricorder.”</p><p>Mara held up her own scanner. “Nor mine, Spock.” her head shot to her left as Discord was by her side. She shouted, let go of her scanner with her right hand, pulled out her disruptor and fired it at Discord's head.</p><p>A stream of water shot from the emitter, washing over Discord's face and matting his fur and beard down. He held a hand to his forehead and swooned. “Oh, my dear Mara! I had no idea you felt that way!”</p><p>Kang placed a hand on Mara's disruptor and pushed it down. “A good shot, Mara. Not a good idea to take it, though.” He looked to Celestia and Luna and bowed his head. “I take full responsibility for her actions.”</p><p>Celestia and Luna exchanged a look. Celestia turned to Kang and Mara and shrugged. “Truth be told, if I had a bit for every time I wanted to shoot Discord, I could buy both Earth <i>and </i>Q'onos and have enough left over for some cake.”</p><p>Discord held up a claw, but stopped and shrugged. “Eh, can't blame you too much there, Celly dear.” He looked to Kirk and Kang. “I bet you two have <i>so </i>many questions! Where do you even start?”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Fascinating, Captain. He is rather reminiscent of Trelane. At least in his level of maturity.”</p><p>A teacup and saucer appeared in midair. Discord snatched the cup, took a sip and then spat it out. “Me? Reminiscent of that bratty little half-pint? Please! I'm the picture of refinement and maturity.” He pulled back part of his fur and reached into a dark hole. “And if you believe that, I have the deed to Sherman's Planet here somewhere.”</p><p>Kirk rolled his eyes and leaned heavily on the table with one hand while massaging his forehead with the other. “I hope your antics will be somewhat... limited, Discord. Or at least relatively... <i>harmless</i>.”</p><p>Celestia shrank down slightly in her chair. Discord snorted. He disappeared, reappearing inside a witness stand. Another version of himself stood in front of him and held out a book. Discord placed one paw on it and held the other up. “I won't lie, Captain. I was a vicious, sadistic monster. Other sapient beings were my playthings. I twisted reality around like it was taffy. All for my banal, base amusement. I offer no defense for what I did.”</p><p>Kang crossed his arms. “I note you used the past tense there, Discord. That and Celestia and Luna are not in a blind panic, either. You are... better?”</p><p>The witness stand and other Discord disappeared. Discord held a microphone up to his mouth as applause sounded out. “Johnny, tell him what he's won!” Discord suddenly dropped his arms. “As seriously as I can, Captain, I suppose I am. I learned all-too-well what it was like to be the victim, to be on the receiving end. A bit of friendship and kindness from those who had every reason to abandon me has put me down a... better path. I'm still a bit wacky, and definitely chaotic, but I limit myself to mostly-harmless pranks nowadays.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Fascinating.”</p><p>Discord chuckled. “Probably the best reaction I could get from you, Mister Spock.” He held up a paw. “No worries. I won't try to break your emotional control. I'm not a <i>Platonian</i>, for Chaos' sake. I'm a lot better than I used to be.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “I am rather grateful for that.”</p><p>Kirk waved a finger in the air. “So, Discord... how chaotic... <i>are </i>you, nowadays? Or even back then?”</p><p>Discord steepled his digits together and leaned forward. “Oh, quite a bit, Captain. I'd be all over the place, literally! Even now I can go off here and there and everywhere!”</p><p>Kang snorted. “Like a child vying for attention.”</p><p>Discord turned to face him. He moved forward, but stopped. “Well... yes, I suppose.”</p><p>Kirk exchanged a look with Kang, then looked at Discord. “I... doubt you're as chaotic as you claim, Discord.”</p><p>Discord's head snapped around. “What?”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “You're right, Kirk. If he was as chaotic or random as he makes himself out to be, would he even be coherent? You play with some random gags and tomfoolery, but it's all to get other's attention.”</p><p>Kirk nodded and waved a finger at Discord. “Yes, Kang. You're right. This... avatar of chaos is really just playing the fool. There's probably quite the... <i>calculating mind</i> underneath his jibes and all these random acts. Although they're not so random, are they.”</p><p>Luna arched an eyebrow. “Very astute observations, Captains.” She turned her head. “Well, Discord?”</p><p>Discord held up a paw, but lowered it. “Quite astute,” he finally said. “You're right. I <i>do </i>so love the attention. And when I didn't get it, I would... force others to pay attention to me. Against their will and all that. Quite horrid of me, on reflection.”</p><p>Spock spoke up. “You mentioned earlier that you felt what it was like to be on the receiving end of such torture, Discord.”</p><p>Discord straightened up, his unruly hair replaced by a hairdo eerily similar to Spock's own. “Very good observation, Mister Spock. I was–”</p><p>Celestia spoke up. “Discord, you don't... <i>have </i>to say anything.”</p><p>Discord slowly looked to Celestia, a small, genuine smile forming. “I do, Celestia. These gentlebeings deserve to know who and what they're dealing with.” He held his hands up and a window appeared above him. The image of Tirek appeared inside it. “I betrayed Equestria and all its citizens to aid a monstrous demon known as Tirek. He was attempting to acquire all the magic in Equestria.”</p><p>Mara spoke up. “To what end?”</p><p>Discord shrugged. “As it's been said, some people just want to watch the world burn. In the end, he tricked and betrayed me, stripping me of my <i>own </i>chaotic magic and imprisoning me.”</p><p>Kang snarled. “Honorless coward, stabbing his allies in the back. May this Tirek rot in <i>Gre'thor</i> for all time.”</p><p>Discord grinned. “He is, Captain. He is.” The image changed to that of Twilight Sparkle. “In the end, Twilight freed me, despite having no sane reason to, other than it was the right thing to do.” He lowered his hands and the window disappeared. “And now I'm just trying my best to make up for past misdeeds.”</p><p>Kirk and Spock exchanged a glance. “Well, it is rather... <i>admirable </i>of you to do that,” Kirk said. “I just hope you don't take too much offense if we remain... on our guard.”</p><p>Discord grinned. “I'd be insulted if you <i>didn't</i>, Captain. I may pop onto either of your ships. Or I may not. Either way, I'll be seeing you.” A door flashed into existence behind Discord. He tipped a hat that was suddenly on his head to everyone before opening the door, walking through it and closing it behind him. The door vanished, along with Discord.</p><p>Kang reached up and activated his communicator. “<i>Pride</i>, this is Captain Kang.”</p><p><i>“Commander Kina here, sir.”</i></p><p>“Kina, Mara and I have just encountered a... a being known as Discord.” He growled. “He's one of those semi-omnipotent godlings that have begun popping up. Give word to the crew that if he's encountered, he is not to be attacked. He's immune to our weapons, and if angered, would be very dangerous. Remember your Kahless, Kina.”</p><p><i>“Understood, Captain. I'll make a ship-wide announcement immediately. Anything else?”</i></p><p>Kang looked to Mara. She shook her head after a moment, and he spoke once more. “Negative, Commander. We'll keep you informed. Kang out.”</p><p>Kirk turned to Spock. “Well, if I may borrow a catchphrase, this has certainly been a... <i>fascinating </i>turn of events.”</p><p>Spock nodded slightly. “Indeed, Captain. One would call it interesting.”</p><p>Celestia slid off her chair and walked around the table. “Captains, Discord may be annoying, but he's also right. Luna and I could bore you with technical details about gravimetric distortions and transwarp sensing, but the simple truth is, Luna and I use our innate powers to move the sun and moon around our planet in stable orbits. There's a path that leads from the sun to Equus that lets any changes be seen by the populace instantly. Due to our connections, we can detect any changes or problems nearly instantaneously and work to correct it. We weren't the first to do so, we may not be the last to do so.”</p><p>Luna rose and also walked around the table, opposite the direction of Celestia. “In the meantime, we maintain the system's orbital mechanics for those living here. It is our duty, and one we gladly perform.”</p><p>Kang looked from one to the other, then to Kirk. “I suppose that is the best explanation we will receive on this matter. At least for now.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “Well, at least it's <i>an </i>explanation.” He bowed to Celestia, then Luna. “Thank you for speaking with us about it.”</p><p>Celestia smiled, returning the bow. “You're more than welcome, Captain. Spock, Mara, you both are more than welcome to continue your research. Ask any questions you wish to, conduct any scans you feel necessary.”</p><p>Mara held up her tricorder and flipped it on. “I will definitely take you up on the offer. Princess, may I take a scan of you?”</p><p>Celestia cantered about to face Mara. She leaned forward, tilting her head from side to side. “It won't tickle, will it?” At Mara's look of confusion, she winked. “Kidding, kidding!” She let out a snort and shake of her head. “When you've lived as long as Luna and I have, a little fun is needed to break the monotony.”</p><p>Luna barked a laugh. “Yes, 'fun'. I have rather come to enjoy fun over the past few years. It does tend to relieve stress.”</p><p>Kang grunted. “I know the feeling. I think all those with power and responsibility do.”</p><p>Kirk slowly nodded. “Spock and I have encountered other beings that... express the same desire.” He looked to Spock and waved his hand about. “At the... <i>amusement </i>park planet. The more advanced the mind, the greater the need for play.”</p><p>Spock slowly nodded. “Not your exact phrasing at the time, Captain, but it does convey the original message.” He looked to Luna and flipped his own tricorder open. “With your permission, your highness?”</p><p>Luna stretched her wings out. “Proceed, Mister Spock. I am actually quite curious to hear what your device will tell us.”</p><p>Spock held the tricorder up and slowly waved it across Luna's wings. “I would have to download the scans into the <i>Enterprise's</i> computer for a thorough analysis. However, I am detecting high levels of energy flowing through discrete channels in your wings, horn, and hooves.”</p><p>Mara turned her head at Spock's words. “As am I.” She turned back, continuing to wave her tricorder over Celestia's body. After a few minutes, she snapped it shut. “Thank you, Princess. This will be most illuminating.”</p><p>Celestia's brow furrowed. “Mara, was that a joke?” She slowly smiled. “If so, it was a good one.”</p><p>Kang leaned his head back and laughed. “We Klingons are not as joyless as some would make us out to be.”</p><p>Kirk walked over to Celestia's side. “Your highness, as Discord brought up earlier, concerning the... upcoming duel with Blueblood. Are you... <i>sure </i>there's nothing you or Luna can do to dissuade him from this course of action?”</p><p>Celestia's head drooped, while Luna unsuccessfully tried to stifle a nicker. “I'm afraid not, Captain. You remember me mentioning the Three Tribes earlier?” At his nod, she continued. “To put it briefly, before Equestria, the ponies were mainly divided along racial lines–earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns. They eventually unified into Equestria, and eventually Luna and I came to rule over them.”</p><p>Kang spoke up. “Did Discord have anything to do with you two coming to power?”</p><p>Celestia looked to him, smiling slightly. “Yes, he did.” She looked to Kirk once more. “When Luna and I assumed power, we negotiated certain compromises with those still in power. Legal checks on what we can or can't do. And we <i>will </i>abide by those. One of them is... concerning formal duels.”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted to the right. “Formal duels... such as the one Blueblood challenged me to.”</p><p>Celestia's ears folded against her skull. Her cheeks flushed red. “There hasn't been a formal duel like this in a <i>very </i>long time, Captain. As loathe as I am to say this, it just... slipped through the cracks.”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “It is good to see that the monolithic bureaucracy is a universal constant.”</p><p>Celestia half-smiled. “Too true, Kang. Too true.”</p><p>Kirk held his hands out. “Well, thank you for explaining, Princess. I'll just have to... do my best against Blueblood when the time comes.”</p><p>Kang's brow furrowed. “Do I sense trepidation or even... fear from you, Kirk? This is an honorable duel against a foppish idiot.” he reached over and smacked Kirk on the shoulder. “It won't be the most glorious battle, but it should be quite entertaining to see you win!”</p><p>Kirk stumbled a bit. He nodded to Kang, even as he rotated his arm around and massaged his shoulder and upper back. “Thank you, although I'd prefer to... not have to duel him in the first place.”</p><p>Celestia waved a wing at him. “As I said before, Captain, no matter the outcome, it will not affect negotiations with the Federation. Blueblood challenged you after insulting Rarity. It's on his horn.” Her expression softened. “Just... go easy on him, all right?”</p><p>Kirk motioned to himself. “Me? Go easy on <i>him</i>?”</p><p>Spock spoke up. “Captain, you <i>have </i>dealt with far more dangerous opponents. I estimate you have a ninety-three point seven-six percent chance of defeating him without causing any permanent or fatal injuries to him.”</p><p>Kirk looked to Spock. “Spock, you do remember I grew up on a farm, right? I know what... horses can do if they manage to connect with a kick. It's not pretty. Add in any innate unicorn powers and this won't be easy.”</p><p>Kang smiled. “Nothing worth doing <i>is </i>easy, Kirk.”</p><p>Kirk looked to Kang, merely returning the smile and nodding.</p><p>Spock continued. “I do, Captain. That is why I place your chances so high. I have also been conversing with Princess Sparkle about how to negate unicorn magic. I should be able to prepare a brief training regimen for you tonight.”</p><p>Kirk walked over and slapped Spock on his left arm. “Thank you, Spock. I'm sure it will be a most thorough briefing.”</p><p>Luna cleared her throat, getting everyone's attention. “Is there anything else, then?” She waited a moment for any objections before continuing. “Very well. I call this meeting to be adjourned. Captain Kirk, Captain Kang, we'll see you tomorrow at nine o'clock. Conference room five, this time.”</p><p>Mara held up her tricorder. “Mister Spock, I shall be over to the <i>Enterprise </i>tomorrow, 0900 hours. I have a feeling we will have much to discuss.”</p><p>Kang stepped over to Mara's side. “I shall be there, Princess.” He activated his communicator. “<i>Pride</i>, two to beam up.” He looked to Celestia, then Luna, then Kirk. “Tomorrow I shall begin to show you the wisdom of allying with the Klingon Empire, and the glory that would await you by our side. Energize.”</p><p>Kirk pulled out his own communicator and flipped it open. “<i>Enterprise</i>, two to beam up.” He bowed to Celestia, then Luna. “Good night, your highnesses. Tomorrow I shall show you... <i>our </i>side. And what we have to offer.” he looked back down at his communicator. “Energize.”</p><p>Luna waited until Kirk and Spock had disappeared before walking over to Celestia's side. “Sister, I do believe they feel we have to choose one <i>or </i>the other.”</p><p>A teacup floated up and over to Celestia. She took a slow sip before speaking. “I do believe you're right, Lulu. We're going to have to nip that in the bud and show them a third option.”</p>

<p>1. Thanks to <a href="/user/sun+tzu" rel="nofollow">sun tzu</a> for editing and suggestions.<br/>2. The incident with Twilight that Discord refers to is from the beginning of 'What About Discord'. The events of this fic mean that the episode never happened. It is the <i>only</i> way for me to include Discord and not have him be resealed or killed, since that episode <i>destroys</i> any lingering chance of me taking the attempts at him being 'reformed' seriously. That is all I'm gonna say on it, unless you want thirty-plus pages of Striker's Rants of Ranty Ranting here.</p>						</aside>

<p>Scotty looked out and up at the two-story cottage in front of him, and the six ponies standing in front of it. Five were earth ponies, and the sixth was a unicorn. He, several science officers, and four security guards, had beamed down to a 'rock farm' on Captain Kirk's orders for a survey mission. An equal number of Klingons were there as well, clustered together in their own group. He paid them no mind as he walked up to the sextet. “Good morning...” He focused on the lone stallion. “Mister Igneous Rock Pie, I presume?”</p><p>Igneous slowly looked up at Scotty, a stalk of wheat in his mouth twitching back and forth. “Aye, Lieutenant Commander Scott. I welcome you to my family's rock farm. May providence favor you.” He waved a foreleg to his right. “Allow me to introduce my wife, Cloudy Quartz, and my oldest daughter, Limestone.”</p><p>Cloudy Quartz adjusted the glasses perched at the tip of her muzzle. “A pleasure to meet you, Commander,” she said, her voice never rising or lowering.</p><p>Limestone stalked forward, head high and upper lip curled back. She jabbed a hoof at Scotty. “You and the rest of your gang better not get in our way too much. We've got a <i>lot </i>of work, especially in the south field.”</p><p>Scotty held his hands up. “Don't worry, lass. We'll stay out from under your hooves. I know what it's like to have people underfoot when you're trying to get work done. Or perhaps underhoof in this case?”</p><p>Limestone continued staring at him, but her expression softened slightly. “Well... okay. Just keep that in mind.”</p><p>Igneous waved his foreleg to his left, his expression never changing. “This is Marble, our youngest, Maud, the second-oldest, and Maud's marefriend, Trixie Lulamoon.”</p><p>Marble shrunk back, her cheeks flushing from gray to beet-red and her mane flipping over her eyes.</p><p>Maud slowly looked up. “You're from space? How fascinating. How many rocks are there?”</p><p>Trixie stood up on her hind legs and waved her forelegs about. A strong breeze kicked up, sending her cape waving about. “Welcome, visitors from the stars! I, the Great and Powerful–sorry, the Humble and Penitent Trixie, am most eager to hear your tales from beyond!” Her horn lit up and fireworks blossomed above her and the others.</p><p>Limestone slapped her forehead. She walked around and right up to Trixie, literally butting heads with her. “For Celestia's sake, Lulamoon! Can you tone it down a bit?”</p><p>Trixie growled and pushed Limestone back. “This is neither the time nor the place, Limestone! We have visitors!”</p><p>“I know. That's why I'm cutting your horse apples short!”</p><p>Scotty held out a hand. “Ah, lasses. I think–”</p><p>Limestone's eyes narrowed. “Yeah, and you're embarrassing the Tartarus out–”</p><p>Maud shoved herself between the two. Her eyes shifted from Trixie, then to Limestone, both mares quickly quieting down. She looked up at Scotty. “My apologies, Lieutenant Commander. Limestone and Trixie can be a bit volatile.”</p><p>Scotty held a hand up and waved her off. “No worries, lass. Truth be told, my own sister and I can have a devil of a time getting along. Then there's my brother-in-law.” His expression suddenly grew distant. “I can only hope young Peter takes after his mother.”</p><p>Limestone backed up slightly. “Okay. Sorry, Trixie. Sorry, Lieutenant Commander Scott.”</p><p>Trixie bowed her head. “I also apologize. That was the old Trixie. The new Trixie is supposed to not be so overbearing.”</p><p>Igneous spoke up. “Trixie, Maud, if you could, please take Lieutenant Commander Scott to the north field. Show him the basics of how rock farming operates. Answer any and all questions he has.”</p><p>Trixie started to stand up on her hind legs, but a quick glance from Maud settled her down. “Trixie and Maud would be honored,” she said.</p><p>Igneous looked to Cloudy, then to Marble. “Very well, then. If there's nothing else, Cloudy, Marble, Limestone, and I have several things to do around the farm. Lieutenant Commander Scott, you have our itinerary if you need to find us, correct?”</p><p>Scotty reached back, unclipped a PADD from his belt and held it up. “Aye, I do, Mister Pie. If I need you or the others, I'll come running.” He paused. “By the way, no need to be so formal. You can just call me 'Scotty',” he said, smiling.</p><p>Igneous slowly nodded. “I shall keep that in mind, but I would prefer to use your full name and rank. If you'll excuse us?” At Scotty's nod, he and Cloudy turned and headed for the house.</p><p>Limestone walked over to Marble, who had shrunk down and was studiously examining a clod of dirt in front of her hooves. “One thing, Scotty,” Limestone said. She pointed to a <i>huge </i>egg-shaped rock near the farmhouse. “Don't go near Holder's Boulder. Okay? Holder Cobblestone found it in a dragon's nest, and it brings the family good luck. You wanna use your doohickeys and scan it, go ahead. But <i>don't </i>touch it!”</p><p>Scotty bit back a sigh. “All right, lassie. We'll leave your... boulder alone...” His brow scrunched as he followed the direction of Limestone's foreleg and took his first good look at Holder's Boulder. “Are you sure that's really a boulder, lass? I mean, found in a dragon's nest? Why would a dragon have an egg-shaped boulder in a dragon's nest?”</p><p>Limestone waved him off. “Dragons are instinctive hoarders. If it was an egg, it would've hatched by now. It's completely solid, through and through.” She started to lead Marble off, but stopped, glanced over her shoulder at Scotty, pointed a hoof at her eyes, then jabbed it back at him before finally turning and walking off in a southerly direction, Marble right behind.</p><p>Maud and Trixie walked up to Scotty. “Mister Scott, if you'll follow Trixie and I to the north field? I think you'll find our work interesting, there.”</p><p>Trixie glanced to Maud. “More weeds?”</p><p>Scotty's brow furrowed. “Wait, lassie. 'Weeds'? At a rock farm?” He barked a laugh. “Aye, and if my mother had wheels, she'd be a wagon!”</p><p>Maud shook her head. “No. She'd still be your mother.”</p><p>Trixie walked right up to Scotty. “As odd as it might sound, calling them 'weeds' <i>is </i>rather appropriate. However, I think it'd be better for us to show you, rather than just stand around and talk about it.”</p><p>Scotty rubbed his chin. “Good idea, lass. I might need a geology expert for this.” He pulled out his communicator and flipped it open. “Ensign Naraht, please report to the Pie's house.” He looked back down at the ponies. “Now, Ensign Naraht is a bit... unique. He's a Horta from Janus VI.”</p><p>Trixie barked a laugh. “Oh, Scotty! Equestria is populated by a wide variety of people. In my travels I've been all over, and seen a–”</p><p>A loud <i>shuffling </i>and <i>scraping </i>cut Trixie off. She and Maud stared as a large, bulbous mass of brown-and-red rock passed through the fence's gate and shambled over to the trio. A Starfleet utility belt was fastened to his hide, a tricorder, phaser, and standard-issue communicator attached to it. “Ensign Naraht, reporting as ordered,” he said, drawing himself up. A pseudopod of rock extended and doubled back, almost as if in salute.</p><p>Scotty smiled. “Excellent timing, Ensign. We've got work to do in the north field.” He waved at the ponies. “May I introduce Maud Pie and Trixie Lulamoon. Ladies, this is Ensign Naraht, a silicon-based lifeform.”</p><p>Maud's ears twitched back and forth. Her eyes lit up slightly, but her expression otherwise remained unchanged. She walked up to Naraht, reached into her blouse, and pulled out a small, gray rock. “Hello, Ensign. I'm glad to meet you. This is my pet, Boulder.” She held the rock out. “I think you two will be good friends.”</p><p>Trixie stared at Naraht. She looked up to Scotty. “Okay. Definitely... unique.”</p><p>Naraht shuffled around. Though he had no face or visible eyes, everyone could tell he was looking at Trixie. “Well, thank you. Truth be told, though, back home there's a lot of us crawling around. You'd be the odd one out.”</p><p>Trixie grinned. “Perfect. I <i>love </i>being the center of attention!”</p><p>Scotty chuckled. “Now that I can believe, lass.” Movement to his left caught his eye. Scotty looked up as Kellett, son of Grix, approached. “Mister Kellet. I'd ask what you're doing here, but I reckon it's the same as me.”</p><p>Kellett nodded. He held out an arm and waved it around. “If it's preparing survey teams before our date with destiny at the Punch Bowl, then you're right.” He suddenly grinned. “You're not thinking of backing out, are you?”</p><p>Scotty turned to fully face him. He crossed his arms and furrowed his brow. “Not a chance, Mister Kellett. I'm quite looking forward to our little contest.”</p><p>Trixie looked from one to the other. “You two aren't going to start fighting, are you?”</p><p>Kellett looked to her. “No, small pony. Our battlefield will be a tavern. Our weapons, liquor! A far better fight than the last one we were in.”</p><p>Trixie arched an eyebrow. “'Small pony'?”</p><p>Maud shrugged. “Well, to them, we are.”</p><p>Scotty slowly nodded and smiled. “Aye, Mister Kellett. I'll be looking forward to that, too. Soon as I'm finished here.”</p><p>Kellett looked to Maud and Trixie, then to Naraht. “What <i>is </i>going on, here?”</p><p>Scotty paused for a moment. He scratched the back of his head. “Well, Trixie and Maud are about to take Naraht and I on a tour of the north field and show us some 'weed's. Care to come?”</p><p>Kellett frowned. “Weeds?”</p><hr/><p>Trixie and Maud walked along a wide, barren, gray-hued plain. Crystals, gems, and other minerals were strewn about the ground, each one glowing and quietly humming. The very ground beneath the objects glowed and pulsed rhythmically, creating a hypnotic light show.</p><p>Scotty, Kellett, and Naraht all shuffled along, giving the spots of light as wide a berth as possible. They held their tricorders out, the portable scanners whirring and beeping. Scotty held his up and looked the display screen over, eyes wide. “Ensign, is your tricorder registering this?”</p><p>Naraht rumbled along. “I can <i>smell </i>the pergium, sir, along with a number of other valuable minerals and crystals. If I had a traditional mouth, I'd be salivating.” He shuffled up to a line of shaped ingots, his body quivering. “Oh, duranium, cesium, it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet!”</p><p>Scotty barked a laugh. “Laddie, what do you call that acid you can pump out to tunnel through rocks and eat them up, then?”</p><p>Kellett knelt down besides a line of rocks. He shook his head. “I have been on planets in over a hundred star systems in two quadrants of the galaxy. I have seen many things, but by Kahless, I have <i>never </i>seen anything like this.”</p><p>Maud walked up to Kellett's side. She looked to a lightly-glowing crystal as she spoke. “Energy from the planet can leak through the ground, here. Normally it's spread evenly throughout the area, but certain kinds of rocks and crystals draw the energy to them, concentrating it within them and absorbing it, becoming power sources for all kinds of things. Metal gets strengthened when it absorbs the energy, too.”</p><p>Kellett slowly nodded. “The energy gets concentrated in those few spots, which would explain why the rest of the land looks so... desolate.”</p><p>Naraht piped up. “I don't think it looks too bad. Kinda reminds me of home.”</p><p>Maud's voice rose, almost imperceptibly. “I've been studying the energy's effects on different materials all my life. It's so fascinating.” She suddenly turned her head and glanced down, her cheeks coloring the slightest shade of red. “I apologize, Mister Kellett. I didn't mean to let my emotions get the better of me.”</p><p>Kellett stared at her. “Maud, you would make a Vulcan look gregarious.”</p><p>Maud arched an eyebrow. “Thank you, I think.”</p><p>Trixie walked up to a mound of white crystals jutting up haphazardly from the ground. She scowled as her horn glowed and a pickaxe floated out of a saddlebag. “Gentlemen, you were wondering about weeds?” She stood up on her hind legs and waved both forelegs at the mound. “<i>This </i>is what we're talking about when we mention weeds.” She dropped back down to all fours as the three looked to her. “The crystals and other minerals don't capture all the energy. Some of it leaks through the ground and forms these useless growths.” She groaned as she tapped her pickaxe at the base of the mound. “Stupid darned useless...”</p><p>Scotty's mouth slowly dropped as he took in the shape and color of the crystals. He walked over to Trixie, his gait increasing with every step. As soon as he reached Trixie's side, he dropped to one knee and ran his tricorder's scanner over the crystals. He barely noticed as Kellett dropped down beside him, his own tricorder whirring. “If I dinna' see it with my own eyes, I would never have believed it!”</p><p>Kellett snapped the top of his tricorder shut. “I see it with my eyes, scan it with my tricorder, and if someone told me this was happening, I'd call them a liar and fool!”</p><p>Trixie stared at the two. She slowly lowered the pickaxe and slid it back into her saddlebag, her eyes never straying.</p><p>Maud trotted over, Naraht shuffling behind. Maud walked up to the mound and tapped the mound. “What is it?”</p><p>Scotty waved his hand at the crystals. “This-this is insane! Do you have <i>any idea</i> what these are?”</p><p>Trixie slowly shook her head. “No...”</p><p>Kellett barked a laugh. “If they did, I doubt they'd call them 'weeds'.” His expression turned serious. “These are dilithium crystals. They're the key component in our ship's matter/antimatter reaction assembly.”</p><p>Scotty continued. “When exposed to high-enough temperatures and electromagnetic pressures, it becomes porous to antimatter. It's one of the the only known substances to be able to do that, and it does it the best by far.”</p><p>Trixie slowly nodded. “I see...”</p><p>Naraht rumbled forward. “Sir, may I?” At Scotty's nod, Naraht continued. “Dilithium is one of the key components on our ships being able to go faster than light, and move between star systems. Without it, there might not be a United Federation of Planets, or Klingon Empire. It's one of the most valuable substances in the galaxy!”</p><p>Trixie gasped. “Oh, <i>now </i>I get it!”</p><p>Kellett stood up and waved his hand around. “Tell me, does dilithium grow like this in all your fields? Or at other rock farms?”</p><p>Maud looked to the crystals. “They do, and from what I've read about and seen, they form at other rock farms. They've been growing like this since the Pie family settled here.”</p><p>Trixie tilted her head back and forth. “Okay, so what we've been thinking of as 'weeds' are really the most valuable thing in the entire galaxy?” At Scotty's slow nod, she grinned and lightly jabbed Maud in the barrel. “I think your rocktorate's tuition just got paid.”</p><p>Maud looked to her. “We might be able to afford you that new wagon you've had your eye on, too.”</p><p>Scotty rose to his feet. “Are you two daft? That mound of dilithium alone would be enough to buy your own moon!”</p><p>Trixie gasped. She looked up at the sky. “The <i>moon</i>?”</p><p>Scotty held his hand up. “Well, not <i>your </i>moon, but <i>a </i>moon, at least.”</p><p>Kellett also stood up. “Well, Mister Scott. I must speak with Igneous Pie, talk with my survey team, then make a report to Captain Kang and Commander Mara. I shall see you at the Punch Bowl?”</p><p>Scotty nodded. “Aye, Mister Kellett. I have a feeling we'll <i>both </i>be needing a bit o' the strong stuff before this mission's all said and done.”</p>

<p>Uhura walked along Mane Street of Ponyville, tricorder open and whirring softly. She waved at residents of the town as they went about their day, ears picking up everything. Her tricorder recorded it all for later perusal and study.</p><p>All around her, ponies were going about their day. Shops were opening up. Open-air stalls were rolled into place by vendors, opened up, and wares pulled out for perusal and possible purchase. She stopped in front of one such vendor. An easel was set up, with a canvas on it. Several other canvases were in a neat pile on the side. The artist, an earth pony stallion, looked up at Uhura. He closed his right eye, narrowed the other, and held a hoof up. “Madam, let me paint you! Inspiration has struck!”</p><p>Uhura smiled. She placed her left hand on the back of her head and tilted her head back. “Why thank you, Mister...”</p><p>“Ponet, Miss Uhura. Please, pose for me, even if just for a moment. Your beauty is such that it <i>must</i> be captured for all time.” He gently picked a graphite pencil up with his teeth and held it in the side of his mouth, gripped by his teeth while his lips remained free. “With your permission, Miss Uhura?”</p><p>Uhura nodded to him, flashing a dazzling smile. “Don't let me stop you.”</p><p>Ponet spent the next few minutes glancing at Uhura, then sketching on the canvas. Several ponies gathered around him and Uhura as he worked. After a few minutes, he swung the easel around to face Uhura. On the canvas was a pencil sketch of Uhura. “Not my best work,” he admitted. “What do you think?”</p><p>Uhura reached out. “May I?” At his nod, she reached out and took the sketch off the easel. She looked it over, nodding. “It's absolutely wonderful.” She reached into a handbag slung over her shoulder and pulled out a gold coin. “I had some Federation credits exchanged for Equestrian currency.” She held it up to her eye and looked it over. “Is fifty bits enough?”</p><p>Ponet gasped. “Fifty bits? Miss Uhura, please, take it as a gift. I insist.” He looked around at the crowd gathered. Some of them had their forelegs raised and were asking about portraits. He looked back to Uhura and winked. “Besides, I think you just did my business a world of good.”</p><p>Uhura barked a laugh. She slid the coin back into her bag, waved goodbye to Ponet, and turned and walked off. She glanced from stall to stall, but her she quickly spotted a familiar-looking pegasus mare walking down the street, saddlebags half-filled with fruits and vegetables. It took a moment, but Uhura remembered her name. She smiled and waved to her. “Hello, Fluttershy. I didn't know you lived around here.”</p><p>Fluttershy's head shot up at her name, her body tensing slightly. She looked over her shoulder and relaxed as she spotted Uhura. “Oh, hello, Miss Uhura,” she said, turning around to face Uhura as she approached. “Sorry about that. It's been so busy with you and the Klingons showing up, I've neglected my animals a bit.” She waved a wing at the produce.</p><p>Uhura slowly nodded. “That <i>does</i> tend to happen when we show up in orbit. It can get <i>very</i> exciting and hectic during first-contact. Sometimes even dangerous.”</p><p>Fluttershy's ears folded down. “I wish I could say I was surprised.” She looked to the sky. “It must be so dangerous and scary up there. I know Rainbow Dash wants to fly up to your two ships and even take a flight in one of your, what did she call it, one of your shuttles?” At Uhura's nod, she continued. “I know she wants me to go up with her and Twilight, but I don't know. I still get slightly dizzy <i>really</i> high up.”</p><p>Uhura looked to the sky. “Well, like a wise man once said, it's a dangerous business, going out your door. You never know what's awaiting you. It's the same on the <i>Enterprise</i>. We never know what we'll find when we beam down to a planet.” She knelt down beside Fluttershy. “But you know what? That's what makes it worth it. Sometimes it's scary, sometimes it's not. But we'll never know unless we go.” She held out a hand. “It's the only way to meet new people, to meet new friends.”</p><p>Fluttershy's expression softened. She raised a foreleg and placed it in the palm of Uhura's hand, letting her gently grasp it. “You're right, Miss Uhura. It <i>is</i> the only way.” She paused. “Well, unless friends <i>go</i> to your door. Does that work?”</p><p>Uhura laughed. She slowly stood up, and spread her arms. She opened her mouth, and began to sing...</p><p>Uhura: <i>&quot;The universe is great, the universe is vast</i><br/><i>Explore it and you will make friendships that last.&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;This big wide world is scary, at times it is hostile</i><br/><i>But the friends that you make will make it worthwhile!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;The world's a scary place</i><br/><i>But friends you meet will help you keep the pace!&quot;</i></p><p>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;Outside your door, and into the unknown,</i><br/><i>There are countless things to make you scared</i><br/><i>But if you find friends, and don't go alone</i><br/><i>Then fear is lessened as it's shared!&quot;</i></p><p>Both: <i>&quot;The universe is great, the universe is vast</i><br/><i>Explore it and you will make friendships that last!</i><br/><i>The world is terrifying, but worth it in the end</i><br/><i>If one time in ten you make a good friend!</i></p><p><i>&quot;The universe is wide&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;With forests of doom-&quot;</i><br/>Uhurua: <i>&quot;-And stars in the sky!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;The world is very strange&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;With bisons, breezies-&quot;</i><br/>Uhurua: <i>&quot;-And culture exchange!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;The world is so diverse&quot;</i><br/>Uhura: <i>&quot;With Vulcans and Klingons-&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;-Draconequus!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;Across all space and time</i><br/><i>New friendships make discovery sublime!&quot;</i></p><p><i>I can find the friends that I need</i><br/><i>Near and far from home!</i><br/><i>Fear will not stop me</i><br/><i>As in my search for friends through the universe I roam!</i></p><p><i>There's friend throughout the world&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;In Los Pegasus-&quot;</i><br/>Uhura: <i>&quot;-On Earth or Zakdorn!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;There's friends through time and space&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;Up in Canterlot-&quot;</i><br/>Uhura: <i>&quot;-And back in Elas!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;Across the Galaxy&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;Here in Ponyville-&quot;</i><br/>Uhura: <i>&quot;-Or further than Kzin!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;Those we meet on our way</i><br/><i>Are the friends who will lighten up our day&quot;</i></p><p><i>I can find the friends that I need</i><br/><i>Near and far from home!</i><br/><i>Fear will not stop me</i><br/><i>As in my search for friends through the universe I roam!</i></p><p><i>The human and equine</i><br/><i>Or horta, spirit, or crystalline!</i><br/><i>The loyal and the kind</i><br/><i>The strangers, allies, or unaligned!</i><br/><i>The laughing ones who sooth</i><br/><i>And those whose duty is to the truth!</i><br/><i>The giving hearts and more</i><br/><i>All the friends who make our spirit soar!</i></p><p><i>Life is like a song</i><br/><i>With friends beside you to sing along!</i><br/><i>True friends are what we need</i><br/><i>Sometimes in words and sometimes in deed!&quot;</i><br/>Fluttershy: <i>&quot;Friendship is like a spark!&quot;</i><br/>Uhura: <i>&quot;...Yes it is!&quot;</i><br/>Both: <i>&quot;Across the universe</i><br/><i>Our friends are there for us for better or worse!</i></p><p><i>I can find the friends that I need</i><br/><i>Near and far from home!</i><br/><i>Fear will not stop me</i><br/><i>As in my search for friends through the universe I roam!&quot;</i></p><p>Uhura's and Fluttershy's voices held the final note. All around them, ponies stood, transfixed on their duet. As their final note faded, they stomped the ground, cheering and whooping.</p><p>Uhura bowed at the waist. “Thank you, thank you!” She straightened up, but her smile quickly turned into a frown. She looked down. “Fluttershy, why did we start singing like that?”</p><p>Fluttershy looked up and winked at Uhura. “Oh, you'll get used to it.”</p><hr/><p>Scotty, Chekov, two other members of the <i>Enterprise's</i> crew, and two anti-grav sleds loaded down with several bottles and one large barrel, materialized in front of a two-story building on the edge of Ponyville.</p><p>Scotty looked the front of the building over, his eyes landing on the large wooden sign hanging from an awning. He smiled at the image on it, of a grinning pony standing next to an over-sized bowl filled with pinkish liquid. “I think I'm gonna like this place.” He walked up to the door, brow furrowing as he heard loud singing and banging inside. “I think Kellett and his group's already in there.”</p><p>Thelin, an Andorian male, walked up to Scotty. “Should we be expecting a fight?”</p><p>Scotty shook his head and waved him off. “No, laddie. We're not gonna be starting anything.” He brought his hands together and cracked his knuckles. “We'll finish anything they start, though.”</p><p>Chekov turned to the fourth person there, M'ress. “Things could get a little... heated in there, if last time we were at a bar with Klingons is any indication.”</p><p>M'ress nodded and patted Chekov on the shoulder. “Don't worry, Pavel. If anything goes down, I'll keep you safe.”</p><p>Chekov's jaw worked for a moment as M'ress walked towards Scotty and Thelin. “Well, I didn't mean it <i>quite</i> like that,” he muttered.</p><p>Scotty pushed the door open and stepped inside, the others and the sleds following close behind. They stepped into a large room, tables scattered all over the place. A rather long bar was at the back, the Punch Bowl's owner Berry Punch standing behind it. Rainbow Dash and Applejack sat to her left, while other ponies and two or three Klingons were scattered all around, sitting at tables or standing.</p><p>Kellett sat at a piano, another Klingon standing beside it. Kellett's fingers danced across the keys, his voice booming out over the piano, hers joining his as they sang their hearts out.</p><p>Every person in the bar was transfixed on the two. Rainbow Dash and Applejack both sniffed, their eyes watery. Berry Punch slid a stack of napkins over to the two. Rainbow Dash grabbed one and loudly blew her nose with it.</p><p>All too soon, their performance wound down, finally stopping. Even before the final note faded, the ponies stomped their hooves on the ground, while the Klingons all tilted their heads back and howled.</p><p>Chekov leaned in close to Scotty. “I... didn't know they sang like that,” he whispered.</p><p>Kellett stood up and faced Chekov. “There are many things you don't know about us. Our music is but one of them.” He walked up to Scotty. “Our liquor is another, but you'll soon have quite the education on it.” He turned his head. “Worf, Tarqus, the barrels!”</p><p>Two Klingons wheeled two large metal barrels into the center of the room. Worf pulled the tops off of them, while Tarqus grabbed a pair of metal mugs. She dipped them into the barrels, letting them fill with blood wine, then carried them over to Rainbow Dash, and placed them on the bar next to her.</p><p>The liquid sloshed slightly, spilling onto the bar. Where it hit, the wood smoked and bubbled.</p><p>Berry Punch slid her foreleg into the handle of a mug and banged it on the bar. “Okay, listen up!” she shouted. She waited for everyone to turn her way before continuing. “Just so I nip this in the bud, keep the fighting or brawling to a minimum. And no trashing the place. I've got Celestia's assurance that you'll behave yourselves. Well, at least as much as possible.”</p><p>Kellett looked to her. “Captain Kang swore an oath to that effect, Berry Punch. We will not dishonor our captain, nor ourselves, by breaking it.”</p><p>Scotty held his hands up. “Same with us, Miss Punch. We'll keep it as calm as we can.” He walked over to one of the sleds, picked up a bottle from it and held it up. “Now then, Miss Dash.” He walked over to the bar and set the bottle down next to the mugs. “Would you like to try some whisky, lass? Straight from Aberdeen itself, no less!”</p><p>Applejack leaned to her right and held a foreleg between Scotty and Rainbow Dash. “Hold on there, partner. It's not just liquor from beyond the stars.” She looked over her shoulder at a door set into the back wall. “Hey, Big Mac! Pull it in!”</p><p>The door opened. Big Mac walked into the bar, towing a large keg behind him. He parked it in front of Rainbow Dash and Applejack. “This all right, sis?”</p><p>Applejack grinned. “Yup. Thanks, Big Mac. Unhitch yourself and get a seat for some.”</p><p>One of the Klingons tossed his head back and laughed. “Is it that weak cider-water I've heard about? Why bother?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash began to protest, but Applejack waved her off. “Now, darling, no need to get your feathers in a twist. I'll admit, the cider we had at that party a couple days ago wasn't our strongest stuff. Didn't want anyone getting <i>too</i> drunk, you see.” She patted the side of the keg. “This here, however? It's from our <i>special</i> stock.”</p><p>Kellett rubbed his beard. “Is this what your Granny Smith has been brewing in your barn, Applejack?” He knelt down and looked the keg over. “I will try this!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash flew up and over. She looked the keg over, then dropped down next to Applejack. “Wait, Granny Smith's been brewing this?” She rubbed her hooves together and cackled. “Oh, this is gonna be <i>good</i>!”</p><p>Applejack pointed back at the bar. “Why don't you down some of that there blood wine or whisky first, Dash? You've had Granny Smith's special brew before. Remember?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash snorted. “I'm a little fuzzy on the details, Applejack. Shows how good that last batch was.” She flew back to the bar and grabbed one of the mugs. She peered into the top, eyeing the red liquid inside.</p><p>Berry Punch carried a pair of glasses over to Applejack. “I think you two should sample the local wares.”</p><p>Applejack nodded to her. She took the glasses and filled each one with cider the colors of the rainbow, sparkling and shimmering. “Bottoms up, gentlemen!” she said, hoofing a glass to Scotty and Kellett.</p><p>The two looked their glasses over, brows furrowing. Kellett and Scotty looked to each other, locking eyes.</p><p>Scotty held his glass up in salute. “Bottoms up, Mister Kellett?”</p><p>Kellett hesitated for a second, but nodded and returned the salute. “Bottoms up, Mister Scott.”</p><p>With that, both tipped their glasses back. Silence descended over the Punch Bowl as they took a long sip. Scotty and Kellett slowly lowered their glass from their mouths, gasping slightly. Scotty wobbled a bit, but managed to stay vertical. Kellett looked his glass over, blinking rapidly. After a few more seconds, both straightened up and drained half their glass.</p><p>Everyone turned to Rainbow Dash, still holding the mug of blood wine. She held it up to her muzzle and sniffed. “Good bouquet.” She finally sipped some, swirled it about in her mouth, and swallowed. Her wings shot out and her eyes widened. “Oh, this is some of the <i>good</i> stuff!” She drained the mug, then tossed it to the floor with a <i>clatter</i>. “Okay, so how's about some of that whisky?”</p><p>Kellett's eyes narrowed. “You're still flying?” He grinned. “You're made of sterner stuff than I thought!”</p><p>Chekov walked up to Rainbow Dash and held up a square glass bottle. “Miss Dash, instead of that weak whisky, why not try some of Earth's finest alcohol?” He held the bottle up. “Here, vodka! Straight from Mother Russia herself!”</p><p>Scotty placed a hand on Chekov's shoulder. “Belay that, Pavel! The lass wants the <i>good</i> stuff!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash nickered. She floated over, shoved her forelegs between the two, and separated them. “Okay, hold it, you two. Who said I can't try <i>both</i> vodka and whisky? Hay, why don't you two try some blood wine?” She grabbed the mug she had earlier tossed, flew to the barrel, refilled it and flew back to them. “It's pretty awesome!”</p><p>Kellett grinned. He grabbed the second mug from the bar and held it out in front of Scotty and Chekov. “Well, earthers. Care for a <i>real</i> drink?”</p><p>Scotty sniffed. “I would, Mister Kellet, but I think I'll settle for your blood wine.” He took the mug from him, but looked to his bottle. “Care to try some whisky?”</p><p>Kellett took the bottle, pulled the stopper out with his teeth, and spat it into the air. He took a swig from it, swallowing it down. He coughed and shook his head. “Smooth...” he croaked out.</p><p>Chekov slowly shook his head. “Ooh, perhaps it would be best if you held off from sampling the vodka. If whisky does that to you, vodka might knock you out!” He took the mug of blood wine Rainbow Dash had and took a long sip from it. Almost immediately after swallowing, he dropped it from his lips and sputtered. “мой!”</p><p>Kellett barked a laugh, then handed Rainbow Dash the bottle of whisky. She took a <i>long</i> swig from it, then dropped it and licked her lips. “Dang, that's <i>goooood!</i>” She took a big gulp, draining half the bottle. “Okay, what about that vodka? Ooh, Applejack, I still gotta sample what you and Big Mac brought, too!”</p><p>M'ress, sitting at a table with Big Mac, looked to him. “How strong is her constitution?”</p><p>Big Mac chuckled. “Pretty strong, Miss...”</p><p>“Lieutenant M'ress, Big Mac.”</p><p>Big Mac nodded. “Thanks. Well, like I was saying, there was this one time last Nightmare Night she <i>really</i> got soused. Managed to hit a sonic rainboom while flying <i>backwards</i>!”</p><p>M'ress slowly nodded. “Sounds impressive, even if I'm not sure what a sonic rainboom is.”</p><p>Applejack walked over and placed a glass of zap-apple cider in front of Big Mac and M'ress. “Enjoy!”</p><p>M'ress took the proffered glass and held it up. “I wonder how the colors stay separate.” She looked to Big Mac. “Family secret?”</p><p>Big Mac grinned. “Yup.”</p><p>M'ress drank a bit of the cider. She lowered the glass to the table, a grin spreading across her mouth. “Smooth,” she purred out.</p><p>Worf walked over, two mugs of blood wine in his hands. He placed one in front of M'ress, the other in front of Big Mac, then waved at the mugs. “Drink!”</p><p>Big Mac's eyes narrowed. “Come again?”</p><p>Worf pointed to the drinks. “You have not had any blood wine. The purpose of this gathering is to sample unfamiliar drinks. Therefore, I offer you two the finest drink in the Empire!”</p><p>M'ress looked to Big Mac. “For a Klingon, that's rather polite.” She pointed to Big Mac's still-untouched glass. “If that's the case, would it be all right if Mister Worf has your cider, Big Mac?”</p><p>Big Mac nodded and slid the glass of cider over in Worf's direction. “Only if he sits down and enjoys it with us. That'd be might neighborly of him.”</p><p>Worf pulled out one of the other chairs and sat down. He picked the glass of cider up and looked it over. He downed half the glass, dropping it to the table. “This is a warrior's drink!” he said, eyes wide.</p><p>Big Mac looked down at the half-empty glass of cider. “I guess that's one way of putting it...” He slid his foreleg into the mug's handle and held it in front of M'ress. “To your health, M'ress!”</p><p>M'ress grabbed her own mug and lightly tapped it against Big Mac's. “And to yours, Big Mac.”</p><p>The two drank some of the blood wine. M'ress lowered the half-full mug from her lips. Her eyes crossed slightly and her head wavered back and forth.</p><p>Big Mac, meanwhile, slowly drained almost the entire mug. He lowered it from his muzzle and smiled. “Makes me feel slightly warm.” He looked to Worf and smiled. “Thanks, partner. I'll get you a new glass of cider, if you'll fill me up on more blood wine. Deal?”</p><p>Worf rubbed his chin. “An equitable exchange.”</p><p>M'ress' ears twitched. “'E-equitable'?” She purred, grinning widely. “Pretty big word there, Worf.” She suddenly giggled. “Wordy Worf!”</p><p>Worf barked a laugh. “Maybe for some of my crewmates. Not for me.” he looked to Big Mac. “I did not realize we had such a lightweight among us. The Federation is not quite as strong as it appears to be.”</p><p>Big Mac snorted. “Now, now. I remember when I had <i>my</i> first taste of the strong stuff. Put me on my haunches for a bit. Can't tell you the details because, well... I don't <i>remember</i> the details.”</p><p>Worf nodded and raised his glass in salute. “Then it was a good time.” And with that, he drained the rest of the cider. Within seconds, he dropped the glass to the table and coughed a few times.</p><p>M'ress bared her fangs in a grin. “You were saying something earlier, Mister Worf?”</p><p>Worf, still coughing slightly, waved her off. “Unless–<i>hack!</i>–you have that recorded, I will deny any such statement!”</p><p>M'ress' brow furrowed. “What about Big Mac?” she asked, pointing at him with an extended claw. “He heard what you said.”</p><p>Worf waved her off. “He's drunk. Who would trust his memory?”</p><hr/><p>Scotty, Kellett, Applejack, Chekov, and Rainbow Dash all sat at the bar, Berry Punch opposite them. The other patrons were all gathered around them, most of them at least a little wobbly on their feet or hooves.</p><p>Near the back, M'ress was slumped over in a chair, eyes glazed over and purring softly. Worf sat next to her, looking somewhat dazed. Big Mac was still downing shots of blood wine, although he was moving slower with each shot.</p><p>Several bottles and glasses were lined up at the bar. Berry Punch pointed to each one as she spoke. “Okay, this is for 'official' taste-testing.”</p><p>Applejack's brow furrowed. “Well, what was before?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash shrugged. “Fun.”</p><p>Berry Punch pointed to each container. “Okay, we've got whisky and vodka from Earth,” she said, pointing to bottles with a clear liquid, and one a smoky brown. She motioned to a long-necked container with a pale, amber-colored liquor in it. “We've got saurian brandy.” She slid over to the blood wine, and a bottle with a pale, flame-colored liquid in it that had sparks dancing within. “We've got blood wine and fire wine from Qo'noS.” She looked up at Kellett. “Seriously, is that <i>actually</i> made with blood?”</p><p>Kellett grinned. “Does it matter, Berry Punch?”</p><p>Berry Punch tilted her head back and forth. “Hmm... nah.” She looked back down, this time at a carafe with a brown liquid. “And this is raktajino?”</p><p>Kellett nodded. “The closest equivalent would be a human beverage known as 'coffee'. It's not alcoholic, but it <i>is</i> a popular beverage in the Empire.”</p><p>Berry Punch nodded. “Makes sense to me. I have a feeling we'll be needing some of that tomorrow.” She paused in front of a squared-off bottle filled with blue liquid. “And this is...”</p><p>Kellett snatched the bottle and held it up. “Romulan ale?” He looked to Scotty, a grin forming on his face. “I thought this was contraband in the Federation. I knew there was a reason I liked you!” He reared back and slapped Scotty on the back, belting out a laugh.</p><p>Scotty grunted and surged forward, barely stopping himself from hitting the bar. “Oof, laddie! Watch it!” He straightened back up and tugged the front of his shirt down. “There are certain... advantages to being this far out on the frontier.” He gingerly took the bottle back and placed it down on the bar. “Miss Dash, Miss Punch, are you lasses ready?”</p><p>Berry Punch set six eight-ounce glasses in front of each bottle. She gingerly poured from each bottle into the glasses around it. “Okay. We'll each take a drink of each beverage. Don't go too quickly. Make sure to swallow it down before proceeding to the next drink. The raktajino will be last. Any questions?” At their silence and shrugs, she grinned. “Then let us begin!” With that, she grabbed the glass of whisky between her hooves, brought it up to her lips and slowly, but steadily, drained it dry. She wiped her mouth, grinned, then quickly picked up the vodka. Within a few seconds, that too disappeared down her gullet.</p><p>Applejack followed soon after. She downed the whisky. “Smooth!” she said, sighing happily. She looked down the line of drinks and licked her lips.</p><p>Rainbow Dash slurped hers down. She dropped the glass to the bar and licked her lips. “Just as smooth as the last ten!” She backstroked through the air to the next one, grabbed it and downed it just as quickly. She looked to Scotty, Chekov, and Kellett. “Come on, you three!”</p><p>Scotty and Chekov exchanged a glance. “Has she been drinking water all this time?” Chekov asked.</p><p>As the three slowly drank their whisky, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Berry Punch finished off their own drinks, finally stopping at the raktajino. They each picked up a cup, tapped them together and drank it down. Rainbow Dash dropped her cup to the bar and licked her lips. “Dang, that's good.” She looked to Scotty, Chekov, and Kellett as they slowly drank the fire wine. “What is <i>with</i> you three?”</p><p>Chekov paid her no mind as he stepped up to the Romulan ale. His right hand shot out, missing the glass twice. He finally leaned back, closed his right eye and managed to wrap his right hand around it, followed by his left. He gingerly brought it up to his lips, paused, then tilted it back and drank it down. He lowered the glass back to the bar and firmly placed it back on the bar. “Now, don't go anywhere,” Chekov said, waggling a finger at it. He looked back up, smiled... and his eyes rolled into the back of his head as he toppled forward.</p><p>Scotty and Kellet both grabbed him by an arm. They lifted him up onto one of the bar stools, sat him down on it and leaned him back against the brass railing. “He's <i>well</i> past his limit,” Scotty said. As he stood back up, he wobbled back and forth and rubbed his forehead. “And I think I'm near mine, too.”</p><p>Kellett barked a laugh. “It's been a glorious evening. We might not remember it, but still glorious.” He turned his head to the mares as they chatted, Rainbow Dash taking the bottle of Romulan ale and pouring herself another drink. “We lost before we even came into the Punch Bowl,” he said, rubbing his beard.</p><p>Scotty's brow furrowed. “What do you mean, laddie?”</p><p>Kellett shrugged. “They're much denser than we are. They can absorb more alcohol than us.”</p><p>Applejack slammed a hoof on the bar. “Hey, what's 'denser' supposed to mean, exactly?”</p><p>Kellett slowly turned to her. “It means you can drink more and it will affect you less.”</p><p>Applejack nodded and smiled. “Well, then! Not so bad.” She took another swig of Romulan ale and sighed happily.</p><p>Scotty's eyes narrowed. “That's pretty... intelligent of you to say, Mister Kellett.”</p><p>Kellett spun around. He raised a hand, but dropped it to the bar to steady himself. “Ooh, too fast.” He sucked in several breaths before speaking. “Does that surprise you, Mister Scott? Does a Klingon having knowledge beyond how to kill and scheme shock you?” His expression fell. “I cannot blame you if it does.”</p><p>A shadow seemed to fall over Kellett. He leaned heavily on the bar and waved a hand at the table Worf sat at. “That is Worf. He is smart, deductive. He thinks about what the consequences of his actions will be. He is <i>bad</i> with a disruptor or blade. His weapons are words. But in the Empire as it is, the only real way for him to advance is through battle and killing.”</p><p>Kellett patted his chest. “I love my engines. I love tinkering with them, making them more efficient. I'm fair with a blade, but I much prefer a tricorder.”</p><p>Applejack leaned in. “Is... thinking really not all valuable in your empire? I mean I'm not exactly one to talk, but seems a bit extreme, the way you're describing it.”</p><p>Kellett leaned against the bar, almost letting it support his weight. “I suppose, Applejack. The warriors and fighters hold most of the political power in the Empire. It was not always so, but that is how it's become.” The ghost of a smile crossed his lips. “I am lucky that Kang is my captain. He values thinking. He knows that not everyone can wield a blade, not everyone must fight and kill and die. Everything in life is a battle. You, Applejack, fight hunger. You, Rainbow Dash, fight bad weather. <i>How</i> you do such things I am still unclear on, but you still fight your own battles.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash shrugged. “I'm just that awesome, Kellett. And a pegasus, so weather-management is part and parcel of my package.”</p><p>Kellett nodded. “And you, Berry Punch, you fight unhappiness and thirst.”</p><p>Berry Punch smiled and raised a glass of blood wine in Kellett's direction before downing it in one gulp.</p><p>Scotty glanced down at the floor. “Never thought I'd... hear a Klingon speak like this, Mister Kellett.”</p><p>Kellett looked down at his empty mug. “I never thought I'd be in a bar with an earther and not punching them out.” He raised the mug to his nose and sniffed it. “Did you ponies put something into this when we weren't looking?”</p><p>Berry Punch nickered. “I'd prefer <i>not</i> to lose my liquor license, Kellett.”</p><p>Applejack spoke up. “That sort of thing happens in Equestria, Kellett. You make friends. I mean, Klingons make friends, right? Captain Kang seemed pretty friendly when I met him at Pinkie's party. He argued a bit with Captain Kirk, but it didn't really get too bad. Hay, I've had worse rows with Rarity and Rainbow Dash.”</p><p>Scotty and Kellett exchanged a rather uneasy look. “It is different with us, Applejack,” Kellett finally said. “Our nations have been on the brink of outright war more than once. The Federation hems us in, denies us much-needed resources.”</p><p>Scotty straightened up and jabbed a finger at Kellett. “And you Klingons have run roughshod over innocent species all over the place. If it-”</p><p>Rainbow Dash flew up, over, and dropped down between Kellett and Scotty. She unfurled her wings and thrust her forelegs out, separating the two. “Not here, you two. And not now. Just... clink glasses together and don't fight. You two, make the choice not to fight. Just be cool with each other <i>here</i>.”</p><p>Scotty and Kellett locked eyes with each other. After a moment, Scotty held out his mug. “Here, we won't fight. Like back on the <i>Enterprise.</i>”</p><p>Kellett snorted, but he clinked his mug with Scotty's. “Rainbow Dash... is right. Here, now, we are not enemies. We shall drink, get horribly hungover and tell very tall tales of our exploits!”</p><p>Scotty raised his mug to his lips, but before he could sip, the Punch Bowl's front door <i>slammed</i> open. A sextet of yaks muscled through, spreading out. “Yaks thirsty!” the leader bellowed. He trotted up to the bar and slammed a hoof onto the bar, rattling it and sending everyone jumping into the air. “Yaks want cider! Hard cider!”</p><p>Berry Punch's eyes narrowed. She cantered over to the yaks. She stood up and placed her forelegs on the bar, allowing her to stare into his eyes. “Is there any chance you could phrase that a little more polite?” she asked, a brittle smile forming on her muzzle.</p><p>The yak growled, his bushy beard bouncing on the bar. “That <i>was</i> polite! You want yaks to be rude? Yaks can be rude!” He <i>slammed</i> both hooves on the bar, splintering the wood.</p><p>Scotty, Kellett, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack all walked or flew over to the yaks. “Laddie, you're paying for that,” Scotty said, cracking his knuckles.</p><p>One of the other yaks spun about. “Keep out of this, strangely-shaped thing! We yaks want cider, and we get cider!”</p><p>Kellett's hand went to his belt, but stopped before he unsheathed his <i>d'k tahg.</i> He instead jabbed a finger at the yak. “You would be wise to apologize to Berry Punch and pay for damages caused.”</p><p>The yak snarled. He slammed a hoof into Kellett's chest, sending him stumbling back a bit. “We yaks get cider!” he bellowed.</p><p>Applejack and Rainbow Dash maneuvered behind Kellett, stopping from falling and hitting the floor. He nodded to them. “Thank you, friends.” He looked to Berry Punch, who merely nodded. With a loud shout, he <i>hurled</i> himself upon the yak, fists swinging and managing to punch him right between the eyes.</p><p>Berry Punch shrugged. “Well, they <i>did</i> start it.” And with that, she leaned over, grabbed a bottle with her mouth, and smashed it over the yak leader's head.</p><p>Scotty grabbed his mug tightly in his hand. He rushed the yak Kellett was tangled up with and swung at the yak, hitting him square in the side of the face. The yak's head <i>snapped </i>to the right, a tooth flying out.</p><p>Rainbow Dash and Applejack exchanged a look. “Well, guess all bets are off!” Applejack shouted. She reared back and shouted, “Yee-hah!” before galloping forward towards the yaks, Rainbow Dash following.</p><p>The two ponies surrounded one of the yaks, separating him from the others. He swung at the ponies, but they danced around him. Rainbow Dash flew up and over him, landing right on his helmet and pushing it down over his eyes. As he stumbled about, Applejack pulled a lasso out of her saddlebags and flung it, wrapping it around the horns of his helmet. She yanked back with all her might, sending the braying yak into a spin the that sent him <i>crashing</i> into a table–the table Big Mac, M'ress, and Worf sat at.</p><p>M'ress woke with a jolt. She let out a hiss and raised her hands, claws extending from them. As the yak grunted and struggled in the splintered remains of the table, she raked them across his flank. Big Mac, meanwhile, turned and kicked the yak <i>hard</i> with his hind legs. The yak <i>flew</i> across the bar, hitting a wall and bouncing off of it.</p><p>The other yaks let out bellows and shouts. They stomped and pawed at the floor, but the other patrons soon surrounded them, shouting and waving hooves or hands in the air. One of the yaks charged forward, tossing her head about and knocking several ponies about. Thelin and Worf flanked her, ducking her horns. Thelin tackled her, knocking her legs out from under her while Worf swung a chair at her head.</p><p>The fighting continued for several more minutes, a few other tables and chairs being demolished. The front door opened once more, this time five unicorns clad in the armor of the Royal Guard galloping in. They spread out, their horns lighting up. Within seconds, everyone was enveloped in their magic and floated into the air, separated from everyone else.</p><p>Scotty looked to Kellet and chuckled. “Well, party's over, I guess.”</p><p>Above the bar, Chekov suddenly snapped awake. He rubbed his forehead. “Oh...” He blinked and looked around. “What did I miss?”</p>

<p>Kirk paced back and forth in front of Shelin, M'ress, Chekov, and Scotty. The five were in a room in one of the lower levels of Canterlot, the four participants of the brawl in the Punch Bowl having been brought in from holding cells in the rarely-used dungeon, the Klingons and yaks in other cells for the moment. The four all stood at attention as best they could, considering various scrapes, bruises, and the amount of alcohol imbibed only two hours before.</p><p>Kirk clasped his hands behind his back as he stopped in front of Scotty. “Well, this was not... <i>exactly</i> how I wanted the time before my meeting with Celestia to go.” He spun to face the engineer. “In your own words, Commander Scott. What... happened?”</p><p>Scotty stared straight ahead. “Well, Captain, we arrived at the Punch Bowl all right. We all had some drinks. The Klingons had drinks. The ponies, <i>they</i> had a lot of drinks. Kellett and I exchanged... <i>some</i> words, but nothing really came of it.” He shrugged. “For the most part, it was actually pretty nice. Certainly had worse times in a bar, I can tell you that.”</p><p>M'ress smirked and purred. “Like Station K-7, Mister Scott?”</p><p>Scotty grinned. “Aye, lassie. Or that time– ”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Belay that, Scotty.” He held both hands out. “The... <i>Punch Bowl</i>?”</p><p>Scotty's expression fell. “Oh, sorry, sir. Well, Kellett and I were about to toast each other. A genuine toast, with a <i>Klingon</i>! But before I could drink, those blasted beasts came blundering in!” His eyes blazed and he raised clenched hands. “And I didn't even get to finish my drink!”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted slightly. “You didn't get to... finish... your drink. I see, Mister Scott. So, the yaks came in...”</p><p>Scotty nodded. “Aye, sir. And those beasts had the devil in them! One of them yelled at Berry Punch, the wee lass who ran the pub, and smashed her bar like an angry Gorn. Kellett confronted it, and that yak smacked him in the chest. After that, well...”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “That... lines up with the reports I've received. Miss Punch was quite... <i>adamant</i> that the yaks initiated hostilities.” He paused for a moment. “I'll be discussing this with Princess Celestia at the meeting. In the meantime, however, I'm afraid I'll have to... confine you to quarters for one day, although I won't put anything into anyone's permanent record, since none of you were on duty at the time <i>and</i> your actions were in defense of others and yourselves. Mister Chekov, though, is exempt from confinement. He was the... <i>only</i> one not involved in the altercation.”</p><p>M'ress hissed slightly. “Only because he was passed out at the bar.”</p><p>Kirk's head turned and he glared at M'ress, silencing her. “I... <i>can</i> make a note in <i>your</i> record, Lieutenant, if you wish.”</p><p>M'ress straightened to attention. “No, sir,” she said, swallowing.</p><p>Kirk nodded, smiling. “Good. Dismissed.” He waited for them to turn and begin walking out before speaking. “Scotty, wait a moment.”</p><p>Scotty stopped. He stepped back from the others and walked around back to Kirk. “Aye, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk waited for the others to leave the room before speaking. “Scotty... while you were speaking with Kellett. How were you... <i>feeling, </i>at the moment? Do you remember?”</p><p>Scotty's brow furrowed. He rubbed his chin and stared off at the wall. “Well, sir. I must admit the alcohol hazed it up a wee bit. Still... aside from one brief spat, we <i>were</i> getting along rather well.” He smiled rather broadly. “Must admit, it wasn't too bad.” The smile fell away as quickly as it had appeared. “Why, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk leaned in a bit close. “Just something I've noticed among the crew and the Klingons. We seem to be a bit... friendlier than normal. Kang and I had a rather... <i>interesting</i> discussion at Twilight's castle the other day. We managed to keep it about the level of raised voices.” He waved Scotty off. “Thank you, Mister Scott. Dismissed. Although as before, for the moment, you <i>are</i> confined to quarters.”</p><p>Scotty shrugged and smiled. “All right be me, sir. I've got some brand-new technical manuals to catch up on!” And with that, he walked out.</p><hr/><p>Kang stood in front of Kellett, Worf, and Tarqus, hands clenched behind his back. “I must say I was not expecting to find you three here in the dungeons after a brawl in a bar. Most surprising.”</p><p>Kellett stared straight ahead. “Captain, I take full responsibility for the incident at the Punch Bowl. As the ranking officer, I am the one–”</p><p>Kang held up a hand, silencing his chief engineer. “Honorable, but unnecessary, Kellett.” He reached into a pocket on his vest and pulled out a folded piece of paper. “I received a letter from the proprietress of the Punch Bowl when I arrived. She swears that none of you initiated hostilities, and all fault lies with the honorless yaks. I have no reason to doubt her.” He smiled faintly. “I'm actually impressed with you three, that you stood up for Miss Punch and aided her against those <i>Ha'DibaH.</i>”</p><p>Kellett visibly deflated. “Thank you, Captain. Orders, if any?”</p><p>Kang rubbed his chin. “Worf, Tarqus, report back to the <i>K'naiah's Pride. </i>Resume your duty stations and tell tall tales of your epic encounter with the yaks. Kellett, I need you a moment longer.” He waited for Worf and Tarqus to exit before stepping up to his chief engineer. “Kellett, at this bar, before the yaks arrived, how did you and the others interact with the <i>Enterprise</i> crew?”</p><p>Kellett's eyes rolled up slightly as he stroked his beard in thought. “Well, we had a tense moment or two. Mister Scott and I almost got into an argument, but... the pegasus Rainbow Dash managed to defuse tensions.” He barked a laugh. “She did it by telling us to drink, so I'm not sure we could have refused if we wanted to!”</p><p>Kang cracked a smile. “Of course. Nothing can break tensions faster than being offered a drink. Thank you, Mister Kellett. You are dismissed.” The smile fell away as quickly as it had appeared. “Now, then, Princess Celestia. You, Kirk, and I have some things to discuss.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight paced back and forth in front of Applejack and Rainbow Dash. The three stood in the throne room of Friendship Castle, near the Cutie Map. Twilight's head bobbed up and down as she spoke. “I can't believe this! You two were supposed to be having a nice time at the Punch Bowl, not tearing the place down!” She stopped in front of Rainbow Dash and leaned in close. “Well? What do you have to say for yourself?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's ears folded against her skull. “Stop shouting, for one, Twi. Yeesh. You're loud enough to be heard in Tartarus.”</p><p>Applejack spoke up. “And second off, we didn't start anything. It was those dang-blasted yaks! We were having a pretty good time when they barged in and one of them wrecked part of Berry Punch's bar! If we didn't do anything, they would've done even more damage!”</p><p>Twilight turned to her. “Well, okay... but did you try talking to them, first?”</p><p>Applejack and Rainbow Dash exchanged a glance before both directed a withering stare at Twilight. “Well, Kellett did,” Applejack said, “but the one of the yaks kind of planted a hoof in the middle of his chest and tried to cave his rib cage in.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash nodded and snorted. “Yeah. Come on, Twilight! We didn't start anything. And if we didn't <i>do</i> anything, the Punch Bowl would've gotten wrecked! What gives?”</p><p>Twilight opened her mouth, but nothing came out. head dropped. “I... I'm really sorry, you two.” She let out a groan, stretched her wings out, and cracked her back. “This whole thing's got me so tense. There's never really been anything like visitors from beyond the planet itself.” She cracked a smile. “Nothing really in any book for this that I've read. I mean, it's one thing for people from the next house or town or even <i>country</i> to show up, but another star system? <i>Multiple</i> star systems? There's also what Sunset Shimmer wrote back to me.” She rolled her eyes. “Ugh, is it this afternoon, yet?”</p><p>Any response was cut off by a knock at one of the doors. Twilight's horn glowed and it opened, revealing Berry Punch. “I hope I'm not disturbing anything,” she said, peeking in.</p><p>Twilight shook her head and waved her in with a wing. “Oh, no!” She waited for Berry Punch to trot over before continuing. “Are you all right? How's the Punch Bowl? Is Ruby Pinch all right? What about Ponet? And–”</p><p>Berry Punch raised a foreleg and placed it over Twilight's mouth. “I'm all right, thank you. The Punch Bowl's been pretty heavily damaged, and will be closed for maybe a month due to damage. Ruby was at school, and Ponet was at Mane Street. Thank you for asking.” She looked to Applejack and Rainbow Dash. “And to you two, thank you <i>so much</i> for what you did. Things would've gotten a lot worse if you and the others hadn't stopped those yaks. Drinks are on the house for you two for the rest of your lives.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash pumped a foreleg. “Yes!” She glanced from side to side as everyone turned and stared at her. “What? Oh, right. Ah, you're welcome, Berry. And glad you're all right.”</p><p>Applejack bowed her head. “Much obliged, Berry. If you need any help with the repairs, just ask.”</p><p>Berry nodded to the two, then looked back to Twilight as she removed her hoof from twilight's mouth. “I wrote two letters, one for Kirk and the other for Kang. I told them the same thing I told you.” Her expression fell. “I hope none of them get into any trouble.”</p><p>Twilight glanced to the ceiling and rubbed her chin in thought. “I... think I can talk to them later tonight, Berry. I know they're meeting with Princess Celestia this afternoon, and I've got a meeting of my own to attend, too. I'll make sure they're aware of what happened, Berry. Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!”</p><hr/><p>Celestia sat at a small round table in Conference Room Three in Canterlot Castle, quietly sipping some tea and eating cake. Luna was asleep, Cadance dealing with matters in the Crystal Empire, and Twilight had her own business to attend to. <i>This should be interesting, and fun.</i> Two communicators, one from the <i>Enterprise,</i> and one from the <i>K'naiah's Pride,</i> were placed in front of her. She glanced to a clock on the wall, noting the second hand sweeping across the face. “And four, three, two...”</p><p>Both communicators beeped. Celestia's horn glowed and she delicately twisted a knob on each of them. “Hello, this is Princess Celestia. One at a time, please. <i>Enterprise,</i> first.”</p><p>Uhura's voice came over, a tinge of static to it. <i>“Your Highness, Captain Kirk is ready and standing by to beam to your location. Over.”</i></p><p>A few seconds later, a male voice came over the Klingon communicator. <i>“Captain Kang also stands by to transport on your command, Princess.”</i></p><p>“Thank you. Send them down anytime.”</p><p>Two columns of light appeared, quickly resolving themselves into Captains Kirk and Kang. The two oriented themselves before turning to Celestia. “Your highness,” Kirk said, bowing. Kang, meanwhile, thumped his chest in a Klingon salute.</p><p>Two chairs slid away from the table. “Good to see you,” Celestia said, smiling as they sat down. She floated over cups and saucers to them. “Now, before we talk about the official bulletin points, there's the matter of a little incident at the Punch Bowl.” She held up a hoof. “I've read testimony from patrons there and Berry Punch herself. And I know she's written letters to you both. I don't hold them in any way responsible for the destruction caused, and would like to personally thank them for their heroism. As for the yaks, they're in the dungeons at the moment. I sent a letter to Prince Rutherford, the leader of Yakyakistan. I'll wait until I hear from him before dealing with the yaks.”</p><p>Kang nodded, smiling slightly. “I am relieved to hear that, Princess. I felt the same way. I did not punish any of them, and I will make arrangements for them to meet you.”</p><p>Kirk hesitated. “I... didn't put anything in their permanent record, but had all but Chekov confined to quarters pending the... <i>outcome</i> of this meeting. I'll have them released from that, <i>and</i> arrange to have them meet with you.” He leaned forward. “Princess, there's been a... <i>discovery</i> at a 'rock farm'.”</p><p>Celestia took a sip of her tea and bite of her cake. “Oh, you mean the dilithium weeds that sprout up there? I was wondering when you'd find them.”</p><p>The two captains sat in their chairs, frozen for a moment. They exchanged a look before Kang spoke. “You... <i>know</i> of them? How are they formed? Where does the energy for them come from?”</p><p>Celestia pointed at the floor. “There's a small... subspace leak, for lack of a better term, near the core of Equus. A magic portal, in other words. It's not unstable or destructive, and provides for rock farming, the dilithium crystal growths, and is a nigh-limitless supply of power.”</p><p>Kirk waved his hand in the air. “Your Highness, This changes... <i>everything. </i>Dilithium crystals are one of the most, if not... <i>the</i> most valuable substances in the galaxy. And you have them... <i>growing </i>out of the ground! The implications are beyond enormous.”</p><p>Kang nodded. “Kirk speaks the truth. When this gets out–and it will–Equus will become one of the most important planets in two quadrants of the galaxy. It will be quite... dangerous.”</p><p>Celestia sighed. “I think I see where this is going. Now, I <i>do</i> thank you both for the concern you're showing. And you're right. This will change things a bit. However, it won't be <i>nearly</i> as dangerous as you think.” Her horn glowed once more.</p><p>Every object in the room, barring Celestia, Kirk, Kang, and the chairs they sat in, floated up. They spun about, pirouetting in the air. “As I control these objects, I control the sun. And Luna controls the moon. Any starship or starship<i>s</i> who attempt to attack our planet will be in for a very short and unpleasant surprise.” She focused on Kang. “And as you noted, it would be unwise to challenge us. If pressed, we could be more... forceful. As a last resort, mind.”</p><p>Kang nodded. “Mara <i>did</i> note you could unleash a solar flare upon any attacking fleet, or Luna could use the moon itself as an unstoppable kinetic-kill vehicle. You're well-defended, Princess.”</p><p>Celestia hung her head slightly. “Believe me, Captain. Those two options would be our last resort. I loathe the idea of violence, but if it comes down to it, I <i>will</i> protect this planet and all who live upon it.</p><p>Kirk nodded. “A... sensible outlook, your Highness. However, it might not stop those who are... <i>desperate</i> enough. A renewable, almost infinite source of dilithium crystals can... <i>change</i>... the balance of power in the galaxy!”</p><p>Celestia half-smiled as she set everything back down in their proper places. “Well, it's a good thing we've got you two negotiating on behalf of your governments. I have full faith you'll be able to convince them of the folly of trying anything against us, and instead, both governments working <i>with</i> us. As friends.”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “As 'friends', Princess? I highly doubt that will occur.”</p><p>Kirk shifted a bit in his seat. “I must... concur with my Klingon colleague, Princess. I... highly doubt our governments will <i>ever</i> see eye to eye.”</p><p>Celestia looked from Kirk to Kang. “Your crews were able to cooperate and drive away a very powerful entity that fed off of hatred. It had every advantage over you, yet you still put aside your differences and laughed it off the <i>Enterprise</i>. It would've been so easy for you to succumb to your hatred. Instead you both managed to see reason and stop the conflict before it consumed you all. If you can manage to stop fighting under such circumstances, then it's within the realm of possibility for your governments to do the right thing and end hostilities.”</p><p>Kang waved her off. “The circumstances on the <i>Enterprise</i> are <i>far</i> different than those we are currently in. To have real, lasting peace between the United Federation of Planets and Klingon Empire would be difficult, to say the least!”</p><p>Celestia stared at him, expression neutral. “I never said it would be 'easy', Captain Kang. I said it would be 'right'. It's almost never the easiest thing to do, but it has to be done. And it <i>can</i> be done. At one time, I wished for Discord to be gone forever, to be dead or locked away in Tartarus for all eternity. I gave him a chance, and although it went roughly in more than one instance, we are now... not enemies. And someday, we might even be friends. I've lived a long time, and have seen many things that were once deemed difficult or impossible happen.”</p><p>Kang met Celestia's stare with one of his own. “What may happen in the future has no bearing on my mission, here. I was sent by the High Council to secure your allegiance, and within the bounds of my honor, I shall do so.” He glanced to Kirk. “Just as Captain Kirk shall do <i>his</i> best to lure you away from the correct choice.”</p><p>Celestia's wings ruffled. “That assumes, however, that this is a zero-sum game. That we can <i>only</i> ally either with the Federation <i>or</i> the Empire.” She leaned forward and smiled. “My sister and I believe a third option is available, where we ally with both governments and open diplomatic and trade deals with you.” She looked from Kang to Kirk. “And wouldn't that be better for all of us?”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted to the right. “I suppose for the moment... neither of us have any real... <i>choice</i> in the matter, Princess?”</p><p>Kang crossed his arms. “You're right. I too doubt either of us have much of a choice, Kirk. What is it <i>precisely</i> that you propose, Princess?”</p><p>Celestia clapped her front hooves together. “Excellent!” Two folders floated up and over to Kirk and Kang. They landed in front of them and opened up.“Let's get down to the business of business, Captains.”</p>

<p>Twilight stood in front of the mirror and machinery that linked her world with Sunset's. Her horn glowed and the book that she used to communicate with Sunset floated up and into the cradle at the mirror's apex. It flashed, the machinery chugged and moved, and a swirling vortex appeared inside the mirror. Twilight looked back to Spike, standing right behind her. “Okay, I told Sunset I'll be there for an hour tops. I've told the girls, Cheerilee, and even Captains Kirk and Kang about this meeting. If I'm not back in an hour, let them know, Spike. Okay?”</p><p>Spike nodded. “Okay, Twilight, but...” He hesitated and laced his claws together. “Oh, hay stacks.”</p><p>Twilight stepped up to him. “Spike, are you all right?” She cracked a smile. “I thought you'd be relieved I took so many precautions this time around.”</p><p>Spike snorted, tongues of green flame shooting from his nostrils. “Okay, you got me there, Twi.” He sighed and held out his arms. “I dunno. It's just, Sunset not explaining herself and telling you you <i>had</i> to see it for yourself in her last message. I mean, that's out of a bad plot from a Power Ponies comic!”</p><p>Twilight looked to the portal. “That's a good point, Spike. Still, it's Sunset. So I <i>do</i> trust her.” She looked back to the portal. “I... think.” With that, Twilight sucked in a breath and trotted through the portal.</p><p>As before, the transition from Equestria to Canterlot High, from pony to human, was nigh-instantaneous. She walked through the mirror and emerged from the statue in front of Canterlot High, barely breaking stride or even stumbling as she walked across the concrete. Twilight took a moment to marvel at being bipedal and upright. She looked her lanky arms and fingers over, wiggling them. A shout from her left broke her out of her reverie. She looked up and over to her right, spotting Sunset Shimmer and... “Trixie?”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie stood next to each other, the former wearing a rather bulky trenchcoat, while the latter stood off behind Sunset and was glancing at the asphalt. Sunset raised her right arm and waved at Twilight. “Hey, Twilight. Good to see you!” She motioned to Trixie. “And I see you spotted Trixie.”</p><p>Trixie slowly took a step forward. Her head tilted up, but her eyes were still on the pavement. “Twilight Sparkle... Princess Sparkle... Trixie is...” She sucked in a breath. “I'm sorry for my actions last time you were here. They were wrong, and could have injured you and the others.” She held out her hand. “Friends? Please?”</p><p>Sunset reached out and patted Trixie on the shoulder, squeezing slightly. “Like I told you, Trixie, everyone in the school was under the Siren’s spell.” Her eyes flicked up to Twilight. “Hey, you okay?”</p><p>Twilight blinked. “What? Oh, sorry.” She focused on Trixie. Her own expression softened. <i>I've managed to forgive far worse people out there. And she was mind-controlled. It really wasn't her fault. “</i>Sunset’s right, Trixie. You weren’t in your right mind then. No one was. I mean, in the stage pit, Rarity and Applejack were about ready to tear each other’s heads off!” She took Trixie's proffered hand and shook it. “Friends.”</p><p>Trixie grinned as she tightened her grip slightly. “Thank you.” She turned her head to Sunset. “You were right about her. I should've listened.”</p><p>Twilight followed Trixie's gaze. “Sunset, why are you wearing a trenchcoat?”</p><p>Sunset's cheeks colored. “I'll explain in a bit. In the meantime, we've got something to show you.” She turned, knelt down and picked up a briefcase behind her. “Trixie, ask away.”</p><p>Trixie let go of Twilight's hand. She suddenly reached up, grabbed her shoulders, and stared as her eyes widened slightly. “Twilight... is there a <i>Constitution-</i>class heavy cruiser in orbit of your planet named the USS <i>Enterprise</i>, serial numbers NCC-1701?”</p><p>Twilight stared right back at Trixie. Her jaw opened, but it was almost a minute before she could speak. “H-how did you know all that?”</p><p>Trixie paid her question no mind. “And is the captain of the <i>Enterprise</i> one James Tiberius Kirk, from Riverside, Iowa? Is the first officer one Spock from Vulcan? Is the chief engineer Scotty, and are his engines able to take it anymore?”</p><p>Twilight's eyes somehow widened even more. She slowly broke her gaze away from Trixie and looked to Sunset. “Ah... help?”</p><p>Sunset walked up to the two. She held the suitcase and clicked it open. Inside was a laptop and a slim yellow case made of plastic. “These hold the answers you seek, Twilight.” She lowered herself to the ground and leaned against the statue's base. She powered the laptop up and opened the case up.</p><p>Twilight and Trixie exchanged a glance, then sat down on either side of Sunset. Twilight looked across Sunset at Trixie. “So, how much do you know about...”</p><p>Trixie half-smiled. “Sunset and her friends have filled me in on everything. We've all managed to make up. Pinkie and I even did entertainment for a birthday party last week.” She looked down as Sunset held up a DVD. “How much do you know about our technology?”</p><p>Twilight waved her off. “Oh, I know all about computers and your information-storage discs. We watched a lot of them last time I was here for sleepovers, and before when I slept at the school's library.” She paused as she looked at the DVD case. A bit of chrome caught her eye. She jabbed a finger at it. “Hey, wait a minute. That's the <i>Enterprise's</i> command symbol!”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie exchanged a look. Sunset turned to her right and Twilight. “Twilight, brace yourself. You're about to have your mind blown.” She slipped the DVD into a slot on the laptop's monitor. The screen came to life and a fanfare came from the speakers, majestic despite the size and quality of the built-in audio equipment.</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin. “I don't– ” She sucked in a breath as a <i>very</i> familiar-looking starship came on the screen. “Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! That's the <i>Enterprise</i>! It looks just like the image Captain Kirk showed me” She grabbed Sunset's shoulder and shook her. “Sunset, how did you get footage of the <i>Enterprise</i>?”</p><p>Sunset reached up, grabbed Twilight's arm and stopped the shaking. “Twilight, Twilight, calm down! This isn't footage of the real <i>Enterprise</i>.” She suddenly turned to Trixie, and the two giggled for a bit before Sunset looked back to Twilight. She bit her lip and cleared her throat before continuing. “It's a model.” She looked back to Trixie. “Don't you have the blu-ray edition?”</p><p>Trixie scratched the back of her head. “Sorry. I was a bit rushed getting ready. I didn't really notice until it was too late to go back home and get it.”</p><p>Twilight spoke up. “Okay, that's it!” She stood up and crossed her arms. “Will you two <i>please</i> tell me what the hay is going on here?”</p><p>Sunset shrank down slightly. “Sorry, Twilight. We got a bit carried away, there.” She motioned to Trixie, who stood up. “Trixie's the best one to fill you in. She got <i>me</i> into this, after all.”</p><p>Trixie walked around Sunset to Twilight. “All right, Twilight. I'll try to explain this best and as succinctly as I can. Please keep any questions to a minimum, all right?” At Twilight's nod, she resumed speaking. “In the 1960's a man by the name of Gene Roddenberry was trying to create a television show and get it on the air.“ She held her arm up and waved a hand across the air. “A 'Wagon Train to the Stars', as he called it. It took a few tries, but eventually, on September 8<sup>th</sup>, 1966, 'Star Trek' premiered.”</p><p>Sunset finally stood up and walked over to the two. “The show lasted for three years.” She sighed and shook her head. “I've always wondered what a proper series finale to that show would've been.”</p><p>Trixie waved Sunset off. “You and I both know not to bring that up, <i>especially</i> around my parents.” She cleared her throat and looked back at Twilight, smiling. “The show was, as you've probably figured out, about the starship <i>Enterprise</i> and its crew. That's the show we had on DVD, there. It ended in 1969, but the franchise itself didn't. In 1973, they made an animated series that lasted from 1973 to 1974. Then there were the movies.”</p><p>Sunset held up a hand. “I... think that's enough for now, Trixie. I don't think we should get into the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise, or the reboot movies. At least not now. From what Twilight described and how she reacted to the footage, it's the five-year mission itself.”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “Yeah...” She trailed off. “This is insane.” She turned and began to pace back and forth, five steps one way, five steps the other. “I mean, from what you've told me, and what I've just seen, the <i>Enterprise</i>, the crew, the entire Federation and Klingon Empire, they're all fictional here. Does that mean... does that mean I'm fictional, too?” She stopped pacing and looked over at Sunset and Trixie. “What about our planet? My friends? My family?”</p><p>Trixie looked to Sunset. “Should we bring up 'Parallels'?”</p><p>Sunset waved her off. She walked over to Twilight and gently grabbed her upper arms. “Twilight, as soon as I got your first letter about this, I thought the same thing. I've checked and double-checked, and there's no media even coming <i>close</i> to resembling Equestria. Although, Twilight, somewhere out there in the multiverse, in some dimension, our lives <i>are</i> being played out by actors and actresses. There's nothing really wrong with that. As one famous playwright put it, 'All the world's a stage, and the people, merely players'.”</p><p>Twilight let out a breath. “Well, okay. It's still a little weird, though.”</p><p>Trixie shrugged. “I'd be worried if you <i>didn't</i> find it weird.”</p><p>Both Twilight and Sunset laughed. “Thank you, both of you, for explaining this,” Twilight said.</p><p>Sunset nodded, but her expression fell. “I gotta admit, I'd give anything to be able to go back with you, Twilight. Star Trek is probably my favorite form of entertainment here. The optimism, the hope for a better future just appeals to my inner Equestrian. Trixie, I and some others marathon episodes of the show. And the idea of meeting Kirk, Bones, Spock, and the others, or even getting a <i>glimpse</i> of the <i>Enterprise</i> makes my mouth water.”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin. “Well, why don't you? I mean, you're from Equestria, right? I stabilized the portal so it can be opened any time.” She turned her head. “Trixie, you could come over, too! Well, maybe not immediately. I think there's some stuff we'd have to sort out, first. But after that, you could definitely join us!”</p><p>Trixie jumped up and down. “Oh, you mean it, Twilight?” At Twilight's nod, she sucked in a breath. “Thank you!” She wrapped her arms around Sunset's shoulders in a hug. “Sunset, we're gonna get to meet Captain Kirk and Mister Spock and Bones and everyone!”</p><p>Sunset stood still, however. She glanced away from Twilight and seemed to focus on a spot on the sidewalk. “That's great for you, Trixie. But... I don't think I can go back.”</p><p>Trixie's eyes widened and her arms fell to her sides. She and Twilight stared at Sunset for a few seconds before Trixie spoke. “Sunset... are you <i>crazy</i>?” She grabbed Sunset by the shoulders and, with a tug, spun her around to face her. “This is the biggest opportunity any Trekkie has ever had! You can't not go!” She looked to Twilight. “Come on, issue a royal decree or something!”</p><p>Twilight glanced to Trixie. “It doesn't really work that way.” She leaned in close to Sunset and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Sunset, what's wrong? Why don't you think you can...” She groaned and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Let me guess, and pardon me for being blunt, but are you still feeling guilt about how you left in the first place?”</p><p>Sunset's cheeks flushed red. She walked away from the two, head down and hands slid into the pockets of her trenchcoat. “Twilight, I was a self-entitled brat, to put it mildly. I drove away my family, any possible friends I might've had, and in the end, Princess Celestia herself. All for some damned stupid bid for power that nearly cost me everything, and still probably cost me a lot that I can't get back.”</p><p>Twilight ran over to Sunset. “No, no! Sunset, Celestia won't be mad at you! She'd welcome you with open forelegs. No, forearms?” Twilight shook her head. “Doesn’t matter. Your family will welcome you back, too! You <i>have</i> to come back with me!”</p><p>Trixie spoke up. “She's right, Sunset. Well, I presume she's right about Celestia and your family. But also, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!” She walked around to Sunset's front and poked her in the chest. “This is something Trekkies have literally <i>dreamed of</i> for fifty years! There's no way I can let a fellow fan pass this up, even if Twilight and I have to tie you up and toss you through the portal!”</p><p>Sunset stared at Trixie before batting her hand away. “Trixie, you don't get it. I didn't just burn some bridges, I torpedoed them with antimatter. Celestia trusted me, taught me, and I spat in her face and betrayed her. I pushed away my family, drove them off. Mom and Dad were <i>so</i> proud of me when Celestia took me on as her student, and I just...” She screwed her eyes shut, her voice failing her.</p><p>Twilight slowly reached up and placed a hand on Sunset's shoulder. When Sunset didn't flinch, or pull away, she spoke. “Sunset, Princess Celestia won't be like that. She asked how you were, what happened. You and I both know she wouldn't hold any grudges.” A small smile played at the corner of her lips. “I mean, she managed to forgive <i>Discord</i> of all beings!”</p><p>Trixie's brow furrowed slightly. “I'll ask later,” she finally said.</p><p>Sunset slowly turned and looked to the statue and the portal within. “I... I really do want to. Not just to meet the crew of the <i>Enterprise</i>, but also make amends with Celestia and my family. I just... the risk of rejection would–”</p><p>“'Risk'?” Trixie blurted out, catching Twilight's and Sunset's attention. She abruptly raised her hands and curled her fingers.“Do you wish you had never risked getting into Star Trek, or took the risk of singing to defeat the Sirens? You probably wish we were still using... laser disk to watch Star Trek, or that Gene himself never took the risk on the Wagon Train to the Stars!” She held her right hand up and looked to the sky. “Risk... is our <i>business</i>!”</p><p>Twilight and Sunset stared at her. “Trixie... is right!” Twilight finally said. “Yes, it's a risk, but everything is, Sunset. Besides, you won't be alone. I'll be with you if you want me to.”</p><p>“And I'll be there too,” Trixie said. “Well, eventually.” She glanced to Twilight. “That's still on, right?”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Yes, Trixie.”</p><p>Sunset chuckled lightly. “Don't be too harsh on Trixie. She's right when she says this is something people have literally dreamed of.” She sucked in a breath. “Okay, I'm gonna do it. Just, Twilight? Could you...” She gripped the lapels of her trenchcoat, fingers digging into it. “Could you please not immediately tell Princess Celestia about this? I <i>do</i> want to see her, but I don't want to be surprised or have it be massively awkward. It's gonna be awkward enough as-is.”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “I won't tell a soul. Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” Her head bobbed up and down. “Sunset, pardon me for the odd, question, but, well, why <i>are</i> you wearing a trenchcoat?”</p><p>Sunset looked herself over. “Oh, sorry!” She undid the belt around her waist and unbuttoned the front. With an almost theatrical flourish, she opened the trenchcoat wide and shrugged it off, letting it fall to the ground. Underneath, Sunset wore a red, long-sleeved dress that went down to just below her thigh, and black calf-high boots. Gold embroidery wrapped around her wrists, and the Starfleet symbol was expertly stitched onto her left breast. A satchel was slung around her left shoulder, and a belt with a toy phaser and communicator completed the look. She waved her hands over the dress. “Like it? Rarity made it for me for Halloween, the local version of Nightmare Night.”</p><p>Twilight looked Sunset up and down. “It looks just like what Lieutenant Uhura wears!”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie exchanged a glance and giggled. Sunset patted Trixie on the shoulder. “Okay, Trixie. I'll call you later tonight and let you know what's going on, okay?” She stepped back and held her right hand up, fingers splayed out to form a 'V'. “Peace and long life.”</p><p>Trixie returned the salute. “Live long and prosper.” Her face went blank. “I could be doing that with Mister Spock...” She held her fists up to her face and laughed, her cheeks turning a deep crimson.</p><p>Sunset looked to Twilight. “So, can we go in together?”</p><p>Twilight patted Sunset on the shoulder. “Sure thing, Sunset.” She led Sunset over to the base of the statue. “On three?” At Sunset's shaky nod, she started counting. “One, two...” She stepped through, disappearing from Canterlot High.</p><p>Sunset paused for a moment. She turned, waved to Trixie, then followed Twilight back to Equestria.</p><hr/><p>Spike sat in front of the portal, Power Ponies comic open in front of him. “Hmm, I used to like Zapp the best, but Radiance just seems to grab my attention so much more.” Footsteps from outside the door caught his attention. Spike stood up and looked over. “Hey, hello? Who's there?” Any concern he had melted away when Captain Kirk and Mister Spock appeared at the doorjamb. “Oh, hey guys! What's up?”</p><p>Kirk nodded to Spike and smiled. “Mister Spike, it's good to... <i>see</i> you again. I have some news concerning the duel with Prince Blueblood tomorrow afternoon.” He started to kneel down, but stopped as he spotted the portal. “Mister Spock, tricorder?”</p><p>Spock nodded, holding his already-whirring tricorder up. “Already scanning, Captain.” he waved the tricorder over the portal, letting it linger over the journal nestled at the top. “Fascinating. It is an inter-dimensional portal, with this book actually providing a thread for the pathway to follow.” He looked to Spike. “I presume Princess Sparkle is on the other side of this gateway?”</p><p>Kirk slowly walked over to the gateway, Spike following close behind. “Twilight <i>did</i> mention a friend in an alternate dimension that she communicated with.” He knelt down to Spike and waved a hand at the swirling vortex of energy. “Is... <i>this</i> what she was referring to, Spike?”</p><p>Spike nodded. “Yeah! That friend, Sunset Shimmer, has a book that connects to <i>that</i> book hooked up to the gizmo Twilight built around the mirror.” He puffed out his chest. “Normally the portal between worlds only opens once every thirty moons, and for only three days. But Twilight, being smart and awesome, and with a little suggestion from Pinkie Pie, managed to figure out a way to use the books to connect the worlds any time she needed to!”</p><p>Kirk looked the entire device over. “I shudder to think what'd she do if she got her hands on a book of basic warp-theory. She could be the next Isaac Newton, the next Einstein or... <i>Cochrane.”</i></p><p>Spike slowly nodded. “I'm... gonna guess those three are really smart people?” At Kirk's nod, he chuckled. “Well, yeah. That's Twilight for you.” he laced his claws together over his belly. “So, Captain, you mentioned the duel with Blueblood? What's going on with that?”</p><p>Kirk turned and knelt down next to Spike. “Well, I would like to wait for Twilight to come in so I won't have to repeat myself. Still, it's rather... short. We'll duel in downtown Ponyville, at... <i>Mane Street</i>.” He placed a hand on his chest. “I won't use any weapons, and Blueblood will have a magic-inhibition spell placed on him–a temporary one, of course.”</p><p>Spike slowly nodded. “Hand-to-hoof?” He punched the air. “You'll kick his flank, Captain!”</p><p>Spock turned, his tricorder turned off. “Although the odds will be in Captain Kirk's favor, it would have been preferable for the duel to not take place at all.” His head tilted up. “Captain, I have taken multiple readings. However, it <i>will</i> take the <i>Enterprise's </i>computer to fully analyze the information. I believe it would be wise for Science Officer Mara to be present.”</p><p>Kirk glanced up at his first officer. “Of course, Spock. Make the necessary arrangements with the <i>Pride</i>.” He looked back down at Spike. “Spock <i>is</i> right, Spike.” he gestured with his right hand, waving it about in the air. “Sometimes, we... <i>have</i> to fight, but it should only be a last resort. When every <i>other</i> avenue has been exhausted, then we'll fight. As I once told Anan 7, we may be killers, but we can... <i>choose</i>... not to kill today. We can <i>make</i> that choice, Spike. And it's the right one.”</p><p>Spike slowly nodded. “I get it, Captain. It's the same here in Equestria. It's a lot more fun to get along in friendship than to fight. Right?”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “A most logical line of reasoning, Spike. It is one that I wholeheartedly concur with.”</p><p>The portal behind them flashed. All three turned as Twilight Sparkle galloped out of the portal. She quickly slowed to a trot and stopped. She looked herself over, wings spreading out. “Well, back to being a pony.” She smiled as Spike ran over and hugged her, returning it with her wings. “Hi, Spike!” Twilight's smile broadened as she noticed Kirk and Spock. “Oh, hi! What brings you here?”</p><p>Any response was cut off as the portal's brightness increased. Spock held his tricorder up and snapped it open once more. “There is an increase in energy, Captain,” he said, voice rising.</p><p>Kirk held his hands up to shield his eyes. “I can see that, Mister Spock! Any idea what's causing it?”</p><p>A loud <i>buzzing</i> came from the portal as Sunset emerged, silhouetted by the portal itself. She stumbled a bit, then held up a foreleg and looked it over. “This might take a bit of getting used to.”</p><p>Twilight's horn flashed, and the portal winked out of existence. Sunset stood there, still clad in her Starfleet costume, now shrunk down and re-proportioned for her equine body. She trotted over to Sunset and looked her over. “The portal altered your costume to fit your body.” She walked around Sunset, but paused as she noticed two bundles of feathers pressed tightly against her body. She gasped as realization struck. “Sunset... you're an alicorn!”</p><p>Sunset's head shot around. “Say what?” At the same time, both wings flared out, the right one smacking Twilight in the face and sending her reeling back. She sucked in a breath as her left wing extended, stopping halfway from fully unfurling. She glanced from side to side, eyes wide. “Twilight...”</p><p>Spock raised his tricorder, but Kirk held up a hand, stopping him from doing or saying anything at the moment. He jerked his head back and the two stepped away from the portal for the time being.</p><p>Twilight's horn lit up again. Thin, purple tendrils of magic shot from it and wound their way around Sunset's body. “Well, pardon for stating the blindingly obvious, but you've ascended. You're <i>definitely</i> an alicorn, Sunset. The wings are yours, not that they'd be anyone else's.”</p><p>Sunset rolled her eyes. “Thanks, Twilight. I <i>never</i> would've guessed it myself.” She tried flexing her wings, but they spasmed slightly. “How the hell do you work these things?” She spun about, grunting. “Come on!”</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed and Sunset stopped spinning. “It took me a month or so to get used to these, Sunset. No rush.” The tendrils retreated back into her horn. “My best guess is this happened when you defeated the Sirens at the Battle of the Bands.” She wrapped a wing around Sunset in a hug. “You've come a long way, Sunset. You really should be proud of yourself!”</p><p>Sunset glanced away and blushed, but didn't push Twilight away. “Thanks...” Her head shot up as she spotted Spike. “Spike!” She slid away from Twilight and walked up to the young dragon. “Gotta admit, Spike. You look a lot better like this.”</p><p>Spike ran a hand over his head crest and smiled. “Thanks, Sunset. It's a lot cooler being a dragon than a dog.” He opened his mouth and a small gout of fire shot out. “Or maybe a lot hotter?”</p><p>Sunset bit back a laugh. She turned to Twilight, but stopped as she finally noticed Kirk and Spock standing near the back wall. Her jaw dropped and her eyes widened. “Oh, oh, oh...”</p><p>Twilight looked to Sunset, then to Kirk and Spock, then back to Sunset. Her expression fell. “Oh, no.”</p><p>Kirk stepped forward. “My... apologies, Miss... <i>Shimmer</i>, was it? Or perhaps Princess Shimmer? I... didn't want to interrupt things.”</p><p>Sunset continued to stare at Kirk and Spock. “I... I... I...” She held up her right foreleg. “Peace and long life.”</p><p>Spock held his right hand up, fingers splayed out in the Vulcan Salute. “Live long and prosper, Miss Shimmer.”</p><p>Sunset's mouth turned up in a grin that nearly reached from ear to ear. “Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p>Spock's brow furrowed. “You are welcome, but for what, Miss Shimmer?”</p><p>Sunset swallowed. “I...” She suddenly looked down at her foreleg, still in the air. She grimaced and shook it several times. “Come on, come on!”</p><p>Twilight leaned in. “Ah, Sunset? I don't think you can do the Vulcan Salute with a hoof.”</p><p>Sunset's head shot around and she glared at Twilight. “Not with that attitude you can't!” She looked back to her foreleg. “Please?”</p><p>Spike slowly walked over to Twilight's side, his eyes on Sunset the entire time. “Twilight, what's wrong with Sunset?”</p><p>Twilight tapped the floor with her hoof. “It's... kind of a long story.”</p><p>Kirk looked to Twilight. “Twilight, if this was a... bad time, Spock and I can leave.” He placed a hand on his chest. “I... didn't mean to cause distress to Miss Shimmer. I just wanted to inform you about the duel tomorrow with Prince Blueblood.”</p><p>Twilight glanced up at Kirk. “Thanks, Captain. It's a little complicated, but–”</p><p>Sunset's wings unfolded to their full extent and her horn lit up. “Split, damn you, split!” she shouted at her foreleg. She let out a low keening sound. “I... can... do this!” she shouted. Her breath hitched in her throat and she suddenly toppled over onto her back, legs sticking straight up in the air.</p><p>Silence permeated the room for a moment. Spike slapped his forehead and dragged his claws down his face. Twilight, meanwhile, let out a breath. “Well... always did wonder what it was like to witness one of these.” She looked up to Kirk and Spock, a smile plastered on her face. “Sorry about this, gentlemen. Like I told Spike, it's a bit of a long story.”</p>

<p>Celestia let out a breath as she continued going over paperwork. She leaned back from her desk and snapped her neck back and forth, a loud <i>pop</i> echoing through the room. She glanced out the large bay window of her favorite study at the setting sun and made several adjustments to its course. <i>Luna should be up and about by now. I think I'll have breakfast with her, then maybe see if I can talk with Ayelborne.</i></p><p>There was a gentle knock at the door. Celestia's horn glowed and she opened it, allowing a rather flushed pegasus guardspony to march in. He stopped in front of her desk, sucked in a breath, and sketched a short bow. “Lieutenant Sentry returning from Yakyakistan with a message from Prince Rutherford, your majesty.” He winged a scroll from his saddlebags and held it out in front of him.</p><p>Celestia nodded to him, smiling. “Thank you, Lieutenant. That was rather quick.” She took the scroll from him and floated it over. It unfurled, and she spent several seconds reading it. Then reading it again. Celestia read the scroll once more, then lowered it so she could look down at Lieutenant Sentry from her desk. “Lieutenant, tell me. Did you come <i>straight</i> here from Yakyakistan? Did you encounter, say, Princess Luna, or Discord?”</p><p>Lieutenant Sentry's eyes looked left to right. “No, your majesty. Why?”</p><p>A section of the wall opposite the balcony swung open. Discord stepped out, face comically over-severe. He wore a dusty-gray suit. “You rang...” he intoned, before sliding out of the suit and over to Celestia's side. “Ooh, what is it? Did Rutherford confess his secret crush on you?” He clapped his paws together. “Tell me, tell me!”</p><p>Celestia snorted. “You may go, Lieutenant. Thank you.” She turned to Discord, eyes narrowing. “Discord, did you tamper with this in any way?”</p><p>Discord chuckled. “And risk the wrath of the Post Office? Please?” At her continued stare, he sighed and placed his lion's paw over his torso. “I swear on my friendship with Fluttershy that I did not tamper with, or read that scroll. I know Luna is still combing her mane, so she'll be occupied for another few hours.” He reached down and pulled up a microphone from the ether. “So, Johnny? What's the secret word of the day?”</p><p>Celestia looked back to the scroll and cleared her throat;</p><p>“<i>Dear Princess Celestia Sol Invicta, Princess of Equestria and controller of the Undying Sun.</i></p><p>“<i>Greetings and salutations, your Majesty. I am glad to speak with you, but I would have preferred to do so under less onerous circumstances. To hear that citizens of Yakyakistan would engage in such unprovoked acts of aggression raises my ire. I thank you for informing me of their acts, and, after having independently verified their actions, I have decided to leave their fates in your hooves. They have brought shame upon this fair nation. I trust you to be able to decide on a firm, yet fair, punishment for those miscreants.</i></p><p><i>Your Good Brother</i></p><p><i>Prince Rutherford XII, Crown-Prince of Yakyakistan, Ruler of the North.</i></p><p>Discord's mouth twitched. “He <i>does</i> remember destroying half of Ponyville when he first visited, right? Acting so immature Trelane would have been offended?”</p><p>Celestia waved a hoof in the air. “Diplomacy is warfare by other means. Or something like that. I'm not going to question my good fortune with this, Discord. Prince Rutherford isn't raising a stink about this, for which I am very grateful.”</p><p>Discord nodded. “I suppose so.” He slid to the side, revealing a large roulette wheel. He gave it a spin. “So, what will it be, Celestia? Hot coals on their hooves? Ceti Alpha mind worms? Tholian poetry?”</p><p>Celestia's mouth twisted into a straight line, but she still nickered and snorted. “No, Discord. I think... community service in repairing the Punch Bowl, then escorted to the border of Equestria and banished. That should be enough.”</p><p>Discord sighed, his entire body drooping. “Oh, well. I suppose that will have to do. Sure I can't interest you in some Romulan polka to pipe into their cells?”</p><p>Celestia stood up and walked around the desk. “That doesn't exist, Discord. At least I don't think it does.” Her horn lit up. “I think I'll teleport to Twilight's castle and give her the good news.” Her face turned stern. “Now don't go getting into any dangerous mischief, Discord.”</p><p>Discord threw his arms into the air. They hit the ceiling, fell back, and reattached themselves to his body. “But that's the best <i>kind</i> of mischief!” At Celestia's glare, her sighed. “Oh, all right. I'll be... not evil.” He waved at Celestia as she vanished, then twisted and looked around. He flew forward, passing through the walls like a ghost. He quickly came upon the guardspony who had delivered the scroll and phased himself back into reality in front of him. “Hello, there!”</p><p>Lieutenant Sentry jumped back a bit, but he managed to keep his wings from flaring out. “Oh! Ah... hello, Mister Discord.” He swallowed. “What... brings you here?” he asked.</p><p>Discord floated in close to Lieutenant Sentry. “Sorry to bother you, my dear stallion. It gets boring when Celly's not around and Luna's putting her face on. And Fluttershy's told me I should branch out a bit and meet new friends. So, tell me, are you busy?” He thrust a microphone at the stallion's muzzle. “Still on-duty? I try to be somewhat considerate of that.”</p><p>Lieutenant Sentry sighed. “I... delivering the scroll was my last task for the day. I'm off-duty.” He looked up at Discord. “What's your game?”</p><p>Discord threw his arms out, but stopped. “No, no. Too expected.” He rubbed his chin. “Wait, you're actually <i>considering</i> this?” He clapped his hands together. “Marvelous! Nice to see someone with some spunk!” He snapped his fingers, and Lieutenant Sentry's armor vanished, only to be replaced by a tie-dye shirt, shorts, and a bubble pipe tucked between his lips. Discord snapped his fingers again, and a similar outfit appeared on him. “So, tell me...” Discord rubbed his chin. “Wait a second. I can't exactly call you 'Lieutenant' Sentry while we're gallivanting about. Unless that's your actual first name.”</p><p>A chuckle came from Sentry. “My first name is Flash, Discord.” He looked himself over and flared his wings out. “Nice outfit.”</p><p>Discord floated down to the floor and beside Flash. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Flash. Now, then. Tell me, interested in music?” He held up a hand and waved it off. “Never mind, never mind. Stupid question. Instead, would you like to hear some human music?”</p><p>Flash rubbed his chin in thought before shrugging. “Sure, I guess. It won't be too dangerous, will it?”</p><p>Discord shrugged. “Well, you might die from the sheer auditory awesomeness, but other than that you'll be fine.” A door appeared and it opened, revealing a concert hall packed to the gills and a band on stage playing. “Let me introduce you to Queen...” He led Flash through the door. Before it closed and vanished, though, Flash's voice could be heard one more time.</p><p>“Why are they singing my name?”</p><hr/><p>Sunset glanced up from her seat at the cutie map. An hour had passed since her fainting incident. Twilight and Spike had managed to rouse her. Now she sat at the table, Twilight and Spike flanking her, while Kirk and Spock stood off near the far end of the table. “And that's about it. Six television series, thirteen movies, and <i>god</i> knows how many novels, technical manuals and other assorted bits of media. It's so inspiring to me and others. It's the hope for a better future, one where humans and others can get better, that we can choose not to kill today. The messages some of the episodes convey are timeless, and needed. We...” She trailed off and looked back down at the table, cheeks flushing red. “I'm so sorry. I'm doing it again.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Miss Shimmer, please. I can assure you, I'm not... <i>offended</i> or insulted in any way by the information or by your reactions. If I met Captain Proton I'm not sure I'd... react any different.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “I am not offended either, Miss Shimmer. Your information is merely the ultimate expression of the Vulcan philosophy known as Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.”</p><p>Sunset's head bobbed up and down. “Yes, yes, of course! That makes perfect sense. Thank you, Mister Spock! Thank you, Captain Kirk!” She leaned back in her chair and giggled, her hind legs kicking the air.</p><p>Twilight and Spike exchanged a glance. “I'd say something, but I was kind of the same way when I learned Daring Do was real,” Twilight admitted, her head lowering as she blushed.</p><p>Sunset's head shot over. “Wait, Daring Do–”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “Later, Sunset. Let's focus on the here and now.”</p><p>Kirk spoke up. “Miss Shimmer, these other series. They take place... <i>long after</i> the original and animated series based off of our five-year mission?” He straightened up and started walking, one hand gesticulating. “I wonder... could we use this information to plan ahead? To... <i>save</i> lives? To save planets?” He stopped and leaned on the table, staring off at the far wall. “Still, changing the timeline has never been the... <i>wisest</i> of moves.” He looked over. “Mister Spock, your view?”</p><p>Spock's brow furrowed. “Unknown at this time, Captain. It is entirely possible that, aside from some broad outlines, the television shows and movies Miss Shimmer and Miss Lulamoon have watched do not correspond to our reality.”</p><p>Kirk's mouth formed a straight line. “There has to be <i>some</i> way to figure this out. From what you've told us, at least, the first two series match quite... <i>closely</i> to my own logs. Although some of the details are different, naturally.”</p><p>Sunset mock-gasped. “You mean Bones' instruments <i>aren't</i> dressed-up salt shakers?”</p><p>Spock's head bobbed slightly. “I shall have to confer with Doctor McCoy about that revelation about his instruments.”</p><p>Sunset giggled, her wings unfolding and then folding over her head. “I'm sorry, I'm sorry!” she gasped out between giggles. She cleared her throat, calmed down, and her wings retracted. She glanced from side to side. “Like they've got a mind of their own,” she observed.</p><p>Twilight giggled. “I'll give you some lessons later.”</p><p>Sunset's head dipped down. “Captain... do you remember the mission to Deep Space Station K-7? The one where you encountered the tribbles for the first time?”</p><p>Kirk stared at her. “Rather hard to forget being buried by a mountain of tribbles, Miss Shimmer.” He waved a hand at her. “But please... go ahead.”</p><p>Spike scratched his head. “What's a 'tribble'?”</p><p>Sunset glanced to the ceiling. “Think parasprite, but without wings.” She looked back to Kirk. “Before you left K-7, do you remember a lieutenant giving you a PADD to sign with the duty roster? And saying what an honor it was to serve with you?”</p><p>Kirk straightened up. His face took on a faraway look. “Well... I had a <i>lot</i> of paperwork after that mission. I don't... wait a minute. Dark skin, goatee? Command division colors?”</p><p>Sunset leaned forward. “Do either of you remember his name?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Lieutenant Benjamin Sisko, Miss Shimmer. What is the significance of this?”</p><p>Sunset tapped the table with a hoof. “Mister Spock, his name <i>was</i> Benjamin Sisko, but he wasn't a lieutenant. He was a captain, from the year 2373!” She looked to Kirk. “That was a scene from the episode 'Trials and Tribble-ations', from Deep Space Nine!”</p><p>Kirk jabbed a finger in Sunset's general direction. “That... that means that some of the events from at least <i>that</i> television series, and probably all of them, happened. The odds of such an event happening independent of everything else leading up to it are... <i>astronomical</i>.” He glanced to his side. “Mister Spock, your opinion?”</p><p>Spock slowly shook his head. “The incident <i>does</i> lend credence to the idea that the events of the future television series will happen. However, any information we're given must be used carefully, if at all. Also, the information Miss Shimmer gives us could rapidly become obsolete as events change in response to acting on said information.”</p><p>Sunset groaned. “That's right. I tell you about event A, which changes events B, C, and D from what I saw on the show. And it might not even be good changes!”</p><p>Spike waved a hand in the air. “Well, there's gotta be <i>some</i> events that are gonna happen no matter what, right? And wouldn't it be better to have this information at the ready, just in case?”</p><p>Twilight smiled. Her horn lit up and she gently floated Spike over to her. As soon as he landed, she unfurled one of her wings and wrapped it around him in a hug. “Spike, that's pretty smart of you.” She looked up at Kirk. “I think Spike's got the right idea, Captain. It's better to have <i>some</i> preparation than willfully ignoring the opportunity.”</p><p>Kirk rubbed his chin. “At the least we <i>could</i> copy the information from Miss Lulamoon's discs and send it to Starfleet Command. Spike <i>is</i> right, that it would be better to have this information, just in case. Miss Shimmer, could you please arrange this with her?”</p><p>Sunset sat ramrod straight in her chair, eyes wide. “I will call her the very <i>second</i> I get back across the mirror, Captain! You can count on me!” She suddenly swallowed. “Although, it might be best if we could permit Trixie to, I don't know, present the DVDs in person, for security's sake if nothing else!” She <i>finally</i> slid out of the chair and slowly walked up to Kirk. “In all seriousness, it would mean the galaxy to her.”</p><p>Twilight slapped her face with a wing. “You've gotta be kidding me,” she mumbled.</p><p>Kirk chuckled. “Well, since she... <i>is</i> offering us this priceless information, I don't see the harm in a brief meeting. Although I must emphasize 'brief', Miss Shimmer. We're still on a vital mission, here.”</p><p>Sunset's head bobbed up and down. “Oh, absolutely, Captain! I will emphasize that <i>clearly</i> to her. I'm sure I can impart that to Trixie.” There was a pause. Sunset's ears twitched. “Wait a second...” She slapped her forehead with a hoof. “Wow, I'm an idiot. I didn't even ask what this mission <i>is</i>!”</p><p>Spock clasped his hands behind his back and began speaking. “Two months ago a Class-A probe passed through the Equus System, malfunctioned, and crashed, Miss Shimmer. Pinkamena Diane Pie and Twilight Sparkle recovered the probe, and contact was established.”</p><p>Sunset looked to him. “And with that, the Prime Directive no longer applied.”</p><p>Kirk smiled and knelt down in front of Sunset. “I think you know our regulations almost as well as we do, Miss Shimmer. That's correct. This system is in the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. I... <i>think</i> you have an idea of the Organian Peace Treaty?”</p><p>Sunset focused on Kirk. “I do, Captain.” She kicked at the floor and sighed. “There's... <i>so much</i> I want to tell you right now, but if I start I don't think I'll stop.”</p><p>Kirk slowly reached out and gently patted Sunset on the shoulder. “Your restraint is commendable and... <i>wise</i>, Miss Shimmer. Without proper analysis of what you say, we wouldn't know <i>how</i> to act on anything you say.”</p><p>Sunset's cheeks turned scarlet at Kirk's touch. She bit her lower lip, but her mouth still stretched wide in a smile. “Thank you, Captain. Wait a moment, if our planet is in the Neutral Zone between the Federation and Klingon Empire, who did the Empire send as a representative?”</p><p>Twilight's horn lit up. “Captain Kang of the <i>K'naiah's Pride</i>,” she said, an image of the captain appearing next to Sunset and Kirk.</p><p>Sunset's head shot to her right. “Kang?” She gasped. “Kang! Of course! 'Day of the Dove'!” She stifled a laugh. “Oh, ha, ha! Of <i>course</i> it would be him!”</p><p>The other four in the room stared at Sunset. “Did I miss something?” Spike asked, looking to Twilight.</p><p>Twilight shrugged. “Beats me, Spike.”</p><p>Sunset slapped her face with a wing. The wing repeated the action before her horn glowed and she <i>pulled</i> it away. “Dammit... Okay, sorry. Sorry.” She cleared her throat. “'Day of the Dove' was an episode from season three of the Original Series.” She looked back to Kirk. “Sorry about the outburst, Captain. It's just, what I know about Celestia, I think it's possible she had a hoof in choosing who got sent here. She likes to think several moves ahead, and place pieces into the right position for maximum effect. In this case, peace, or at least improved relations between the Federation and Klingon Empire.”</p><p>Spock's head bobbed slightly. “It <i>is</i> logical, Captain. Both Princess Celestia and Princess Luna <i>have</i> shown awareness of the galaxy at large. Celestia would undoubtedly learn all she could about both the Federation and Empire, then, if possible, influence the selection of representatives.”</p><p>Kirk snapped his fingers. “And Kang <i>was </i>the Klingon commander we probably had the most... positive interaction with during our mission so far.” He shook his head and sighed. “Quite the chessmaster, your Princess.”</p><p>Twilight's brow furrowed. “Captain... is there a problem with the Princess doing that? She's trying to bring peace between your two governments, after all. I''m sure she has the best of intentions, here.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head. “The... <i>road</i> to hell is paved with good intentions, Twilight. I'm not comfortable with Celestia manipulating things like that. If she <i>is</i> manipulating things, though. We don't exactly have... <i>proof</i> of her doing anything.&quot;</p><p>Spock spoke up. “Captain Kirk is correct. At the moment, we merely have a theory that happens to fit some facts and known behavior. It is speculation at best.”</p><p>Kirk motioned to Spock. “Quite correct, Spock. We'll table this for the moment. We have more... pressing matters to attend to.”</p><p>Spike cracked his knuckles. “Like the duel between you and Blueblood?”</p><p>Kirk's head bobbed up and down slightly. “Like the... duel with Blueblood, Spike. Yes.”</p><p>Sunset gasped. “No, wait! Kang!” She stomped a hoof on the floor, rattling the cutie map itself. “I <i>have</i> to talk to him! It's a matter of life or death!” At everyone's stares, she swallowed. “His and Mara's son! He's in danger from the Albino!”</p><p>Spock's brow furrowed. “I was not aware of Captain Kang and Science Officer Mara having offspring.”</p><p>Sunset groaned and tapped the side of her head with a hoof. “No, no! I meant their future son! I mean...”</p><p>Twilight teleported over to Sunset's side and placed a foreleg on her shoulder. “Sunset, breathe! In and out, slowly and deeply.” She sucked in a breath, held it, then slowly expelled it, while moving her foreleg from her chest out with each breath. “Like that, okay?”</p><p>Sunset's head bobbed up and down. She imitated Twilight, her breaths at first coming rapidly, but gradually slowing down. “In, out, in out... Thanks, Twilight.” She looked back up at Kirk, expression neutral. “Captain, in an episode of Deep Space Nine, we learn that Kang's son, along with the sons of Kor and Koloth, were killed by an albino Klingon. If there's <i>anything</i> I can do to stop that from happening, I'll do it!” She stomped her hoof at the end, emphasizing her point.</p><p>Twilight looked up to Kirk, eyes wide. “Captain, I know you and Kang aren't exactly 'friends', but I <i>really</i> think he and Mara should be told about this.”</p><p>Kirk nodded to Twilight. “Princess, Kang and I may not be... <i>friends</i>, as you think of the term, but we're far from enemies. To lose one's son is not something I'd wish on... anyone. I'll let him know you wish to speak with him, Miss Shimmer. Just please, make sure to have all information available.”</p><p>Sunset let out a breath. “Thank you, Captain.” She glanced to the ceiling. “I'll have to ask Trixie about this. There's still a <i>lot</i> about Star Trek I'm not sure on.”</p><p>Twilight hugged Sunset once again. “Well, you're ahead of me in that, Sunset.” A gentle knocking at the door snagged her attention. Twilight glanced over her shoulder. “Come on in!”</p><p>Kirk's head tilted. “Tell me, Miss Shimmer. Who's your tailor? That's an excellent pony-sized reproduction of a... <i>Starfleet</i> uniform. I would've commented earlier, but we did have more... <i>pressing</i> matters to attend to.”</p><p>Sunset bit her lower lip once more. Her wings extended and folded over her head. “Oh, my friend Rarity made it for me,” she said from behind her feathery shield. “Trixie has one, too. Although it's blue and with pants. She wanted to look like, well...” The next few words came out in a rush. “She wanted to look like Mister Spock because he's her favorite character and please don't be mad, Mister Spock, at her for thinking like that!”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Being 'mad' is a human emotion, Miss Shimmer. Although I am... pleased at Miss Lulamoon's choice of attire and favorite character.” His head tilted up as the door finally opened. “Greetings, your majesty.”</p><p>Celestia walked in, head bowed as she looked over the scroll floating in front of her. “Hello, Mister Spock. Sorry for the intrusion, Twilight. I just have some news concerning the yaks. I think you'll all be pleased at this.”</p><p>Sunset's wings snapped back against her body. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Her face froze into a rictus of surprise, shock, and utter fear.</p><p>Twilight, still by Sunset's side, spun about. “P-Princess Celestia?!” She looked back to Sunset, unmoving, expression not having changed. “Ho, boy!”</p><p>Celestia finally looked up and away from the scroll. “Yes, Twilight?” Her smile widened. “Hello, Captain! Hello, Spike! Hello Sunset!” She looked back down at the scroll. “Prince Rutherford has agreed to let... us...” Celestia's horn stopped glowing, and the scroll floated to the floor. Her jaw hung open as her brain finally started registering what she was seeing. “... Sunset?”</p><p>Sunset's head drooped and her shoulder slumped. Her eyes screwed shut. “Of course, now,” she muttered.</p><p>Kirk stood up and sketched a bow at Celestia. “Princess...”</p><p>Silence reigned for a few seconds. Sunset finally spoke up. “Captain, Princess, I believe you all have some news for each other?”</p><p>Celestia's head bobbed up and down. “Yes, yes! Ah...” The scroll floated back up to her face. “Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan has decided to leave the fate of the yaks from the Punch Bowl in my hooves. I am going to have them help repair the Punch Bowl, then send them back to Yakyakistan. I felt those would be appropriate measures.” A half-smile crossed her lips. “I hope Captain Kang agrees.”</p><p>Kirk slowly nodded. “Kang... <i>should</i> be glad to put this affair behind him. He knows when to fight and when not to. Quite a... <i>rare</i> skill to have.” He waved at Twilight and Sunset. “Princess Sparkle, the terms of the duel have been set. Mane Street in Ponyville between Blueblood and I. Hand-to-hoof, no magic from him and no devices from me.”</p><p>Twilight let out a breath. “Thank you, Captain. I'll make sure Mayor Mare is informed and everything is taken care of.” She hesitated a moment. “Captain, is there–”</p><p>Kirk suddenly looked to Spock. “Mister Spock, perhaps we should... get back to the <i>Enterprise</i> and get those sensor readings started, contact the <i>Pride</i> and let them know about what's... going on?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “An excellent idea, Captain. There is much to be done.”</p><p>Kirk looked back and down slightly. “Miss Shimmer, we'll be in... <i>touch</i> concerning Miss Lulamoon and those discs. Again, thank you.” He looked to Celestia and bowed slightly.</p><p>Celestia returned the bow. “No, thank <i>you</i>, Captain. We might have some... things to discuss later. If permissible.”</p><p>Sunset's head shot up. “Yes, yes!” She turned around and stared up in Celestia's general direction, her eyes not quite falling upon her fellow alicorn. “He should know.”</p><p>Celestia swallowed. “Anything you wish for him to be told, Sunset, he will be told.” She glanced over in Spock and Kirk's direction. “Good night, Captain Kirk, Mister Spock. Pleasant dreams.”</p><p>Kirk smiled and pulled out his communicator. “Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>, two to beam up.”</p><p>Spike started sliding towards the door. “And I think... I've got some...” He snapped his claws. “Baking to do, that's it!” He ran to the door, closing it behind him and leaving Celestia, Twilight, and Sunset in the throne room.</p>

<p>Celestia took a few, slow, tentative steps towards Twilight and Sunset. “It's... good to see you again,” she finally said, stopping a couple of feet away from the two. She canted her head from side to side. “You've grown wings.”</p><p>Sunset's gaze shot down once more to the floor. “Yeah. Twilight told you about the Sirens, right? Battle of the Bands?” She looked to her sides, her wings extending. “I didn't know about it until crossing the-the mirror back into Equestria. Still kinda waiting to wake up from this great dream, to be honest.”</p><p>Celestia's eyes shone a bit. “I know the feeling. You've come a long way and done so much, Sunset.”</p><p>A tiny smile graced Sunset's lips. “I had a <i>lot</i> of help along the way, Princess.” She glanced at Twilight, still by her side. “They didn't have to, but they did. Part of me still isn't sure why. I was horrible.”</p><p>Twilight draped a wing over Sunset. “Don't dwell on the past, Sunset. Learn from it, but don't let it overshadow everything you've accomplished. And it's a <i>lot</i>!”</p><p>Celestia nodded. “Twilight's right, Sunset. I know–”</p><p>“Princess, wait,” Sunset said, taking a few steps forward, away from Twilight. She craned her neck his and, with some effort, locked eyes with her former mentor. “There's something I <i>have</i> to say to you. It's very important. May I?”</p><p>Celestia's jaw slowly closed. She bowed her head and took a step back, waving a wing at Sunset.</p><p>Sunset sucked in a deep breath. “I am... I am... <i>so</i> sorry,” she finally said, her voice breaking at the end. Sunset's eyes watered and tears started sliding down her cheeks, but she kept her head high. “You gave me love, an education, knowledge, patience, understanding and I balled it all up and t-threw it back in you-your face. I was horrible to you, my family, to pretty much everyone at the school. To say I was a horrible brat is the understatement of year.” At that, she finally broke eye contact with Celestia. Her eyes closed and the crying increased. “I'm sorry, I'm sorry...” she repeated, her shoulders heaving up and down.</p><p>Celestia closed her own eyes and shook her head. She stepped right up to Sunset's side turned herself around, and lowered herself to her haunches. She extended a wing and draped it over Sunset, pulling her in close. She waited until Twilight was also by Sunset's side before speaking. “No, Sunset, no. Don't do that to yourself. There's a big difference between sincere regret and self-loathing. It's a line I'm quite familiar with.”</p><p>Sunset sniffed and wiped her now-bloodshot eyes. “But what I did–”</p><p>Celestia shook her head. “What you did was... ill-informed, Sunset. Not the best actions, but you weren't alone in culpability. As your teacher, I should have done more to help and guide you.”</p><p>Sunset's head slowly turned in Celestia's direction. “Princess... you did <i>everything</i> you could have to help me. It's not your fault I rejected your teachings, nor did you have <i>anything</i> to do with what I did at Canterlot High! That was all me.”</p><p>Celestia tilted her head from side to side. “I still bear <i>some</i> responsibility, even just as your teacher. That is the truth, Sunset.”</p><p>Sunset's head dropped, but she remained silent.</p><p>Celestia continued. “It speaks well of you to remember past faults and mistakes, so long as you learn from them and use them to better yourself, which it seems you did,” she said, winking. Her expression once more turned serious. “However, if you dwell on them <i>too</i> much, they can consume you.”</p><p>Twilight cleared her throat, getting Sunset's attention. “I have some... experience with that happening to someone here, Sunset. It wasn't pretty, to say the least. Celestia's right. You've done some wonderful things, made some great friends and have saved your adopted world.” She leaned in close to Sunset. “And don't you <i>ever</i> forget that.”</p><p>Sunset bit her lip, but the corners of her mouth still turned up. She looked to Celestia. “I... I will try, to focus on the good a bit more, especially around you. Thank you.”</p><p>Celestia drew Sunset in closer, leaned down and nuzzled her. “We've all made mistakes or missteps, Sunset. It's how we deal with them that's the most important thing. So, how will you deal with yours?”</p><p>Sunset glanced down. “I guess... try to keep them in mind? Learn from them, like you said?”</p><p>Celestia nodded. “An excellent lesson learned, Sunset.” She stood up, Twilight, and eventually Sunset, following suit. She reached out with a foreleg and pulled Sunset in for a quick hug. “I really <i>am</i> proud of you, defeating the Sirens. Twilight told me all about it.” She looked Sunset over. “She forgot to mention you ascending,” she said, winking.</p><p>Sunset barked a laugh. She stretched her wings out. “A surprise to the both of us, Princess.” Sunset leaned into Celestia, a smile quite visible now. “Thank you. It was really close for a bit. If it wasn't for Vinyl Scratch showing up when she did...” Her eyes closed as she shuddered.</p><p>Celestia's horn glowed. A table, two chairs, and a complete tea set popped into existence near the cutie map. “Well, I'd love to hear about it straight from you. If you don't mind, that is?”</p><p>Sunset trotted over to the table. Her horn glowed and one chair slid out, but she suddenly stopped. “Wait...” She slammed a hoof onto the floor, sending out a small tremor. “I can't, at least right now.” She held a hoof up and motioned to the door. “I told Trixie I'd call her tonight and arrange for her to bring several discs with <i>very</i> valuable information over here for Captain Kirk and Captain Kang.” She hung her head. “As much as I'd love to, Princess, I <i>can't</i> put this off. Lives are at stake!”</p><p>Celestia's brow furrowed. “Sunset, I'm afraid I'm not following you. What are these discs, and how can they contain any sort of information that could help Captain Kirk or Captain Kang?”</p><p>Twilight shot to her hooves and trotted over to Celestia's side. “It's... really unbelievable, Celestia, but also really true. You see, there's... there's...” She turned to Sunset and waved a wing at her. “There's something Sunset needs to explain, because I'm still not sure how.”</p><p>Sunset glared at Twilight for a moment. “Thank you <i>very</i> much, Twilight.” She focused on Celestia once more. “All right, over in that reality, as insane as it sounds, the missions of the <i>Enterprise,</i> and the whole Federation? It's a series of fictional adventures across the mirror.” She launched into a rather abbreviated explanation about the 'Star Trek' television show and franchise overall, focused on the first two shows. Her horn lit up and various images appeared, of the <i>Enterprise</i>, of some of the cast, and even a brief snippet of the action.</p><p>Celestia remained quiet through Sunset's explanation, only nodding occasionally. At the end of Sunset's explanation, she finally spoke. “And you told all this to Captain Kirk and Mister Spock?” At Sunset's nod, she cocked an eyebrow. “They seemed fairly calm before beaming away.”</p><p>Sunset shrugged. “Compared to some of the horse apples they faced, this is kinda small potatoes. I mean, they already have experience with alternate realities from the episodes 'Mirror, Mirror', and 'The Tholian Web'.”</p><p>Celestia rolled her eyes. “I'll take your word on that, Sunset. But in all seriousness, when it comes to trying to change the timeline, care <i>must</i> be taken. Even the best of intentions may lead to disaster down the way.”</p><p>Sunset looked down at the floor. “Off the top of my horn, two good men will lose their sons without this information, Princess. If there's a chance to prevent at least that, I <i>must</i> take that risk.”</p><p>Any seriousness in Celestia's expression vanished. She slowly lowered her head and gently nuzzled Sunset. “I am very proud of you for how far you've come, Sunset.”</p><p>Sunset's body froze for a moment, but she eventually returned the nuzzle. “Thank you.”</p><p>Twilight walked up to Sunset and cantered around to her side. “So back now, or later?”</p><p>Sunset waved a wing at the door. “As much as I'd love to stay, have tea, meet your friends, see my family...” She paused and swallowed down a rising tide of emotion. “No, no. I can do that later. Tomorrow, after Trixie and I lend Mister Spock the discs.”</p><p>Celestia nodded. “We're going to hold you to that,” she said, winking.</p><p>Sunset grinned and barked a laugh. She trotted to the door, horn starting to glow, but it opened before she reached it. She slowed to a halt as Spike walked in, wearing an apron, chef's hat, and a tray of cookies in his claws.</p><p>Spike held the tray out. “Okay, I know what I said before leaving is usually a bad excuse to get out of an awkward situation, but I figured cookies couldn't hurt anything.”</p><p>Sunset floated a cookie up and over to her mouth. She took a bite, then finished it off with two more. “Spike, you are one great dragon. A great cook, too.” She floated two more off the tray, scarfing them down quickly.</p><p>Twilight and Celestia floated some cookies towards them, eating them. The glow around Twilight's horn brightened as she floated Spike himself over to her. She placed him on the ground in front of her and wrapped both forelegs around him in a hug. “This was very thoughtful of you, Spike. Thanks.”</p><p>Spike returned the hug, then slipped out of Twilight's grasp and rubbed his claws against his chest scales. “Well, I try. You're welcome.” He looked around. “So... things work out?”</p><p>The three alicorns all exchanged a glance. “I think things have worked out just fine,” Sunset said, as all three smiled.</p>

Confession time. Lyrica Lilac's feelings are... basically mine concerning the general populace of Canterlot. The amount of demonization, villification, and whatnot genuinely angers me. The fact that Discord, Starlight Glimmer, and other genuine villains get passes while the vast majority of a city get their names dragged through the mud because of a <i>tiny</i> minority is horrid. The <i>vast</i> majority of people we've seen in Canterlot are really not that bad. To sum it up, so we don't get thirty pages of Striker's Ranty Rants of Ranting, I'd rather spend time with Blueblood at his canonical worst, than Discord at his canonical best.<br/><br/>4.

It was a bit too much.</a></p>						</aside>

<p><i>Captain's Log; Stardate 6013.23. This afternoon I find myself in the rather... </i>unenviable<i> position of being locked in a duel with one Prince Blueblood. Due to some miscommunication at our formal introductions, I shall now have to... </i>face off<i> against him. Although I still hope to find a nonviolent solution, that hope is fading fast.</i></p><hr/><p>Four golden columns of light appeared in Mane Street, fading away and leaving behind Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Uhura. Several residents of the town were out and about. Some glanced over at them transporting in, but otherwise paid them little mind. The most extreme was from three mares at a flower cart. They jabbed their hooves at the quartet, eyes wide as they gasped and shouted.</p><p>Kirk looked around. He quickly spotted Twilight, Rarity, and Applejack standing in front of a two-story building near the center of Ponyville proper. Twilight stood off from the other two, chatting with an unfamiliar pony by the main doors. She had a gray mane and tail, wore a pair of Prinz-necs at the end of her muzzle, a cravat around her neck, and had a rolled-up scroll for a cutie mark. He started towards them, the rest of his landing party following.</p><p>Bones glanced around the street as they walked. “Right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Well, if Norman Rockwell was a pony.”</p><p>Spock looked to him. “Since Norman Rockwell was not a pony, I believe your analogy falls apart, Doctor.”</p><p>Bones rolled his eyes. “That wasn't the point, Mister Spock, and you know it!”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Then perhaps you should have been clearer, Doctor.”</p><p>Uhura kneaded her forehead. “Must you two do this now?”</p><p>Bones held his hands up. “My apologies, Miss Uhura. You're right.”</p><p>As they walked over, Twilight's head shot to her right. She waved a wing at the group. “Hello, everyone!” She pulled the wing back and pointed it at the mare she was conversing with. “This is Mayor Ivory Scrolls, the duly-elected mayor of Ponyville.”</p><p>Ivory Scrolls adjusted her glasses before bowing her head. “Delighted to finally meet you, Captain. Although I wish the circumstances were different.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “I too wish this hadn't... come to pass.” He looked around at the Ponyville residents in Mane Street and motioned to them. “It seems a bit... <i>busy</i> here, Mayor.”</p><p>Ivory Scrolls looked around. “Well, Captain. You <i>will</i> be doing your duel during the busiest time of the day. And with all the news and gossip that's been floating about, it would've be quite difficult to keep any crowds from gathering on such relative short notice.” She clopped her front hooves together and grinned. “And I'm quite interested in seeing the action!”</p><p>Kirk's jaw canted slightly. “Well, hopefully you won't need more... <i>entertainment</i> after the duel. I intend to keep it as short as possible.”</p><p>Four more columns of energy appeared near the group, quickly coalescing into Kang, Mara, Kinna, and Kellett. Kang looked around, spotted Kirk, and thumped his chest in a Klingon Salute. “<i>qaleghqa'mo' jIQuch</i>, Kirk!” He bared his teeth in a grin. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Kirk returned the salute. “As ready as I'll... ever be, Kang. Here to enjoy the show?”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “Of course! I look forward to seeing you battling that fop. I expect you to teach this Blueblood a lesson in combat he won't soon forget.”</p><p>Kinna cracked his knuckles. “Assuming he survives it, of course.”</p><p>Kirk walked over to Kinna, right hand held up. “No one is killing... <i>anyone</i>, Kinna. I'm going to try one more time to... <i>talk</i> to Blueblood, to make him see reason.” He shook his head. “If he doesn't... then we fight.”</p><p>Rarity strode up to Kirk's side. She was wearing a white, frilly dress this day. “Captain Kirk will do what is necessary, my dear Commander Kinna. If that <i>lout</i> has an ounce of common sense, he'll drop to all fours and <i>beg</i> for forgiveness!”</p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “Shall we get your fainting couch ready, darling?”</p><p>Rarity turned to her, grinning. Her horn lit up and her fainting couch floated into view. “All ready, my dear. Always pays to be prepared.”</p><p>Twilight groaned. She trotted over to Kirk's other side. “My apologies, Captain. Rarity felt it her duty to be here, since she was part of the initial incident. And Applejack wasn't going to stay away.” She looked over her shoulder and motioned at her castle, rising up above the town. “Also, Sunset wrote back to me last night. She and Trixie will be over around five o'clock in the afternoon. Is that all right?”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “This whole affair should be... over and done with well before then.”</p><p>Bones spoke up. “And I'll guarantee Jim will be right as rain for that meeting, Princess.”</p><p>Kang's brow furrowed. “You are having a meeting?”</p><p>Twilight's cheeks turned a pale red. “Yes, and... Captain Kirk, I think Captain Kang should be there.”</p><p>Kang glanced from Twilight to Kirk. “I <i>would</i> appreciate not being kept in the dark, Kirk. What are you plotting? Who is this Sunset Shimmer?”</p><p>Kellett walked over to the group. “Wait, 'Trixie'? I met a Trixie Lulamoon at the Pie family rock farm. And that does <i>not</i> sound like a common name in Equestria!”At everyone’s stares, he smirked. “I have been studying and cataloging all known Equestrian names. And that does <i>not</i> fit known naming patterns.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “An excellent observation, Mister Kellett. I recall that name from Mister Scott's report about the dilithium and other minerals found there. I felt asking about it yesterday would prove too much a distraction from more important matters.”</p><p>Twilight glanced from Kellett, to Spock, then back. “Well, Mister Kellett, the Trixie you met at the rock farm... wait, Trixie's at the Pie's rock farm?” She shook her head, mane whipping about. “No, no! I'll ask Pinkie later. For now, that Trixie and the one I just mentioned are counterparts to each other. Although the Trixie who Sunset knows is only a teenager.” She focused on Spock. “There are a large number of people who have counterparts in the other reality Sunset Shimmer lives in, Mister Spock. Although oddly enough, most of them are teenagers, like Trixie. It's rather fascinating, as you'd say. And I'd love to spend hours talking about it and testing it... when I don't have five-hundred <i>other</i> things going on at once.” She blew a lock of her mane out of her eyes and sighed. “And people wonder why I like checklists and being organized so much.”</p><p>Twilight walked around to Kang. “Captain, if I may suggest you <i>and</i> Captain Kirk meeting me at the cutie map room in my castle about... four-thirty PM today, a half-hour before Sunset arrives? I'll explain <i>everything</i> there. Well, everything that I know concerning Sunset's visit. Everything <i>else</i> would take about a week.”</p><p>Kang looked down to her. “I accept your offer, Princess.” His head shot up and he locked eyes with Kirk. “I have judged you to be honorable and honest, Kirk. So far, you have not given me any reason to doubt this. I hope you will continue that.”</p><p>Kirk met Kang's eyes. “I will, Kang. You'll know what I know.”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her forehead with a wing and sighed. She looked to Rarity and chuckled slightly. “Sad thing is, this is <i>still</i> less stressful than dealing with Rutherford and his delegation from Yakyakistan.”</p><p>Movement in the sky caught everyone's attention. Two air-chariots flew through the air. The lead one carried Princess Celestia, while the second carried Fancy Pants, Fleur Dis Lee, and Lyrica Lilac. The pegasi towing the chariots quickly descended down Mane Street, touching down and trotting to a halt.</p><p>Celestia exited her chariot, the other three following suit. She bowed her head to the guardsponies. “Thank you very much. Please unhitch yourselves and ready yourself for the duel.” She turned and trotted over to Kirk and Kang. “Greetings, Captains. How are you doing?”</p><p>The two captains bowed to Celestia. “As ready as I'll... <i>be </i>for this, your highness,” Kirk said. “I'm going to try and talk to Blueblood once more before this.” he held his hands out. “Hopefully he can... <i>see</i> that there's no reason for this duel. That we can put aside our differences and come to mutually beneficial terms.”</p><p>Fancy Pants walked up to Celestia's side, monocle swiveling about. “A noble sentiment, Captain, but I doubt he'll back down from this. You know how stallions can be when their pride is on the line.”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “All too well, Fancy Pants. All too well.”</p><p>Uhura walked over to Fleur and Lyrica. She stopped in front of the pair, knelt down, and held out a hand. “Well, what brings you two out here from Canterlot?”</p><p>Fleur placed her foreleg in Uhura's hand, letting her squeeze it for a moment. As soon as she pulled it out, she pointed a hoof at Fancy Pants. “I'm accompanying my husband. We're witnesses to the duel. Or something. I'm not entirely sure. It's been <i>ages</i> since the last proper duel.”</p><p>Lyrica's expression darkened. “Well, I'll be the one to say it. I'm here to see that jerk get what's coming to him!” She punched the air. “Right in the muzzle!”</p><p>Fleur groaned and rolled her eyes. “Could you please take it down several notches, Lyrica? I know you're not exactly friends, but that's a little vicious.”</p><p>Lyrica glanced at Fleur out of the corner of her eye. “Oh please, Fleur. I'm well within my right to want to see him taken down several dozen pegs.”</p><p>Uhura stared at Lyrica. “Personal matter?”</p><p>Lyrica hesitated a couple of moments before responding. “Well, somewhat. It's personal for me... and practically the entire population of Canterlot.” She let out a sigh. “Blueblood is... one of the more well-known residents of Canterlot. When people think of residents of Canterlot beyond the Princesses, more often than not they think of him. And he is a pompous, arrogant fool.”</p><p>Uhura slowly nodded. “And then they think that of you and others living there.”</p><p>Lyrica glanced at the grass and dragged a hoof through the blades. “I will fully admit we can be a bit... stuffy, and insular perhaps. But if you listen to how some talk about us, you'd think we were Tirek himself!”</p><p>Fleur shrugged. “I can't say she's wrong to feel that way. We <i>are</i> stereotyped and lumped together. It can get rather irritating when people base their opinion of an entire city off how a tiny fraction act.”</p><p>Uhura shook her head. “I understand what you mean. Well, Lyrica, Fleur, it may not mean much, but just about everyone <i>I've</i> met in Canterlot has been friendly and nice.”</p><p>Lyrica smiled. “Thank you, Nyota. That means the world to me.”</p><p>Uhura straightened up and glanced over her shoulder at Kang. “You know, if the people of Equestria think Blueblood is bad, they're going to be in for <i>quite</i> a shock if they ever travel off Equus. Blueblood's pretty damned tame compared to some beings I've met.”</p><p>Fleur looked up at the sky. “Really?”</p><p>Uhura's gaze drifted slightly. “One day I'll tell you about a man named Khan Noonien Singh.”</p><p>Kirk, still standing with his group, looked up at the clock tower in City Hall. “Well, five minutes to noon. Tell me, Princess, how punctual is... <i>Blueblood</i>?”</p><p>Celestia opened her mouth, but a rapidly-expanding dot on the horizon caught her attention. She waved a wing at it. “Looks like you can ask him yourself, Captain.”</p><p>The dot grew into a third chariot, Blueblood and an older stallion standing in it. It swooped down and landed, some distance from the others. The back opened and the two stallions marched out. Blueblood wore a red shirt, while the other stallion had a full suit on. “I am here for satisfaction!” Blueblood shouted, trotting forward.</p><p>Kirk sighed and cracked his knuckles. He looked up at the clear sky. “Almost hoping this would've been called on... account of rain.”</p><p>Ivory Scrolls shook her head. “Oh no, Captain! I made sure Rainbow Dash and her weather team had every single stray cloud cleared for this.”</p><p>Kirk rolled his eyes. “Thank you... <i>so </i>much, Mayor.” He walked forward. “Prince Blueblood, I ask you one more time to call this off.” He held out his right hand. “This entire incident was a... <i>misunderstanding</i>. There's no reason for us to fight like children or foals!”</p><p>Blueblood snorted. “Oh, now you're comparing me to a foal, Captain? Well, we'll see about that!” He looked to his left. “Auntie, the spell, please?”</p><p>Celestia walked over and stood in front of Blueblood. She lowered her head and a translucent bubble grew from the tip, rapidly expanding. It detached, floated over to Blueblood and enveloped him. It shrank down over his body before disappearing. Celestia's horn glowed and she looked Blueblood over. “It is done, my nephew. For one hour, you will not be able to use unicorn magic.” Her expression softened. “Are you... sure about this?”</p><p>Blueblood swallowed. “I'm... sure about this, Auntie. Please stop trying to talk me out of it.”</p><p>Celestia let out a breath. “All right.” She stepped back and cantered away from Blueblood.</p><p>Fancy Pants walked a bit before stopping approximately halfway between Blueblood and Kirk. “This is a duel of honor between Prince Blueblood of Canterlot,” he motioned to the prince, ”and Captain James Tiberius Kirk of Earth,” and he swept his foreleg to the captain. “This will be hand-to-hoof, no magic or weapons allowed. It shall continue until one of you surrenders, or is rendered unable to continue.” His eyes narrowed. “This is <i>not</i> to the death. Let me make that perfectly clear.”</p><p>Kinna rolled his eyes. “Well, where's the fun in that, then?”</p><p>Fancy Pants paid him no mind as the guardsponies who had pulled the chariots surrounded him. They extended their wings out, the primaries almost touching. “Once you enter, you shall not leave until the duel is over.”</p><p>While the duel was being set up, the residents of Ponyville all gathered, crowding together as close as they dared. Murmurs and conversations drifted among them. Several held up signs with the words “Kirk!” or various fight slogans on them. Food vendors moved about, selling their wares.</p><p>Kirk looked around as Spock, Uhura, and Bones gathered around him. “Any... advice?” he asked.</p><p>Bones scowled. “Dammit, Jim. I'm a doctor, not a fight coach!”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Yet, Doctor, you seem to have mastered the art of the jab.”</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed. She vanished, then reappeared by Kirk's side. “Captain, remember what Mister Spock and I told you!” She pointed to her forehead. “Aim for the horn.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “She is correct, Captain. A proper blow <i>will</i> disrupt Blueblood's equilibrium, and debilitate him greatly.”</p><p>Twilight grinned. “Thank you, Mister Spock!” Her expression turned serious. “But watch out for his kicks. Even a unicorn can pack a wallop if they connect properly.”</p><p>Kirk's gaze went distant for a moment. He rubbed a spot on his forehead. “I have some... <i>experience</i> with that, Princess. Still, thank you for the reminder.” He looked to his left, and Uhura standing there. “Commander, please make sure to record this for... the inevitable grilling Starfleet Command is going to give me over this.”</p><p>Uhura nodded. She reached for her tricorder, hanging from her left shoulder by a strap. She slid it off and away from her body, popping the top flap open and activating it. With practiced ease, she set it to 'record' mode. “Tricorder ready and recording, Captain,” she said as she pointed it towards the guardsponies.</p><p>Kirk smiled at her. “Thank you. Efficient as always, Commander.” With that, he started walking towards the dueling area, Blueblood matching his gait. The two pegasi closest to him retracted their wings, letting him enter. The two pegasi closest to Blueblood followed suit.</p><p>Meanwhile, a large crowd began to gather around the duel. Pinkie Pie bounced over, somehow sliding between everyone there to arrive by Twilight's side. “Has it started? Have I missed anything?”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “They're just getting started.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie hopped up and down. She tilted her head back and part of her mane coiled in on itself. She threw her head forward and the coil burst out, towing a box of popcorn behind it. She sat back on her haunches and was about to stuff her muzzle in, but she paused, looked up, and spotted Mara staring at her. She held the box of popcorn up. “Oh, sorry about that! Would you like some?”</p><p>Mara's jaw worked for a bit. She knelt down and looked Pinkie's head over. “There is no way that box of popcorn could fit inside your mane like that, not with the rest of your skull there!” She held up her tricorder and turned it on. “How did you do that?”</p><p>Twilight's ears twitched. She teleported between the two and thrust her forelegs out. “No, no, no! Mara, you <i>really</i> don't want to go down this hole. Pinkie has some... odd abilities. We just trot with it.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie scrunched down, then popped up between Mara and Twilight. She held the box up close to Mara. “So, popcorn? It's really good!”</p><p>Mara's eyes went from Pinkie, to Twilight, then back to Pinkie. She slowly took a few kernels of popcorn and bit into them. She chewed a bit, then swallowed. “It does not taste bad... but not exactly 'good' either.”</p><p>Pinkie Pie's brow furrowed for a moment. “Oh, I know!” Her mane retracted inward once more, this time pulling out a bottle of Tabasco sauce. She shook the bottle over the popcorn, dousing it with the red liquid.</p><p>Mara stared at Pinkie. She slowly took some of the sauce-covered popcorn and put it in her mouth. She chewed, swallowed, and grabbed for more. “We will discuss where this came from, pink one.” She straightened up as the crowd noise grew. “In the meantime, it's time for entertainment!”</p><hr/><p>Kirk brought his arms up as he entered the dueling circle. The pegasi extended their wings as soon as he passed, metaphorically sealing him and Blueblood in. He shifted into a defensive stance.</p><p>Blueblood, meanwhile, cantered back and forth, occasionally rearing back and kicking at the air. “If you surrender, Kirk, I'll spare you the thrashing that's sure to come!”</p><p>Off to the side, Rarity held up a foreleg and shook her hoof. “You're not getting out of this so easily, you cur! Kick his flank into orbit, Captain!”</p><p>Blueblood dropped back onto all four hooves, lowered his head and charged straight at Kirk, murder in his eyes. Kirk stood his ground, waiting until Blueblood was nearly on top of him before dodging to the side. He rolled along the ground, stopping on one knee to Blueblood's immediate right. He raised both hands, clasped them together, and brought them crashing down onto Blueblood's loin.</p><p>Blueblood let out a grunt. He cantered around, reared back once more, and brought up both forelegs, kicking out at Kirk. All he hit was air, though, as Kirk had already risen to his feet and was backpedaling as fast as he could. “Stand still!” Blueblood shouted, his entire face turning beet-red.</p><p>Kirk half-smiled as he dodged and weaved around Blueblood. “Come on, your highness! Stop horsing around! I've been on worlds where this would be considered... playtime for children!”</p><p>Various spectators laughed. Blueblood let out an inarticulate shout and charged at Kirk once more. Kirk once again sidestepped the stallion, but he was a second too slow. This time, Blueblood swung his head in Kirk's direction, striking Kirk, sending him sprawling to the ground, and ripping his shirt.</p><p>Rarity let out a gasp. “Oh, my!” Her horn glowed and her fainting couch slid close. “Be strong, Captain!” she shouted, holding a foreleg to her forehead and fanning herself with a levitating fan.</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “Now you shall see Kirk at his most dangerous, ponies. Now you shall see why he is feared and respected by the Empire.”</p><p>Kirk rolled with the blow, managing to avoid most of the impact. He rose to one knee as Blueblood approached. His body tensed as he waited for Blueblood to make his move. As soon as the prince spun about and lashed out with both hind legs, he was tucking and rolling, dodging the deadly blows. He came up on Blueblood's left flank and swung a knife-edge chop right at Blueblood's head, striking him with full force at the base of his horn.</p><p>Every unicorn and alicorn in the crowd winced as Blueblood let out a high-pitched scream. His eyes crossed as Kirk landed another chop to his horn. He staggered back, allowing Kirk room enough to rise, ball his fists together and strike him with several blows to his face, sending his head whipping around. Finally, Kirk reared back and struck Blueblood right in the muzzle with the palm of his hand. Blueblood's head <i>snapped </i>back. The unicorn teetered on his hooves for a moment before <i>crashing</i> to the ground.</p><p>A hush descended upon the crowd as Blueblood fell. Fancy Pants walked over to Blueblood and knelt down next to him. Blueblood slowly lifted his head, but it quickly dropped back to the dirt. Fancy Pants rose and pointed to Kirk. “Prince Blueblood is unable to continue! The winner of the duel is Captain James Kirk!”</p><p>Kang struck his chest, then thrust a clenched fist out in salute. “<i>Qap'la</i>, James T. Kirk! Glory and honor to you in this!”</p><p>Mara, Kinna, and Kellett followed with their own salutes and cheers. Slowly, the other spectators started stomping their hooves and letting out their own cheers.</p><p>Kirk staggered a bit. He held up his right hand even as the circle of guardsponies let Bones, Spock, and Uhura through. “Blueblood... <i>Blueblood</i>! The duel is over. This... fight has been concluded. The matter has been settled. Let us... move <i>past</i> it! This has cost us blood and pain, but we can... <i>build</i> upon this! We can... <i>move</i> past this!” The fingers of his hands curled. “We... <i>must</i> move past this!” He slowly lowered himself to one knee in front of the slowly-stirring Blueblood. “Let this not be the end, but the... <i>beginning</i> of something greater!”</p><p>Blueblood raised his head. “After this... you still extend a hoof to me?”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “I choose... <i>not</i> to kill today, metaphorically speaking. I choose peace, Blueblood. What do... <i>you</i> choose?”</p><p>Blueblood rolled himself onto his belly. He panted a few times before speaking. “Pride... would seem to be a poor reason to continue a lost fight... Captain.” He extended his right foreleg, rested it in Kirk's open hand, and allowed himself to be pulled to his shaky hooves.</p><p>Rarity trotted over to Kirk's side. She floated a hoofkerchief up and wiped his forehead. “Captain, are you all right? Did he injure you too badly?”</p><p>Bones unclipped a sensor wand from his tricorder and waved it over Kirk's upper body. “Well, Miss Rarity, a few bruised ribs, but none of them cracked.” He snapped the wand back into the tricorder and placed his hands on his hips. “You were quite lucky there, Jim.” He growled. “What in God's name were you <i>thinking</i>, going through with this? You could've been killed!”</p><p>Spock crossed his arms. “I was not aware you had become an expert in interstellar diplomacy, Doctor.”</p><p>Bones snorted. “No, just an expert in how dangerous it is to fight a pony with one's bare hands, Mister Spock.”</p><p>Blueblood slowly turned and faced Rarity. He bowed his head, but stopped as his eyes crossed. “Ooh, my head...” He cleared his throat. “Miss Belle... I apologize for my actions, both at the party, and at the Gala itself. I <i>was</i> a snobbish boor, and jerk.”</p><p>Rarity looked him over. “Well... I suppose you've been beat up enough today, Blueblood. I will... accept your apology.” She bowed her head to him, then turned and trotted off to Applejack, still standing outside the dueling circle.</p><p>The crowd began breaking up, most of the spectators going back to their previous activities. The guardsponies all took one step back, lowered their wings, spun about, and marched off. Kang walked up to Kirk. He placed his hands on his hips and nodded. “An impressive fight, Captain. You handled yourself well.” He looked down at Blueblood. “Count yourself lucky this was non-lethal, else you’d leave Ponyville in a box.”</p><p>Blueblood shrank back, his ears folding against the top of his skull.</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Kang, that's enough. The duel is over. Honor has been... <i>satisfied</i>. We'll leave it at that.”</p><p>The older stallion that had accompanied Blueblood walked up to his side. “Master, I think we should get you to a hospital. There's Ponyville General. It's close, and has a top staff and equipment.”</p><p>Blueblood looked to him. “Yes, Perfect Place, yes. Good idea. Thank you!” He looked to Kirk, then to Rarity, before turning and walking off, Perfect Place by his side.</p><p>Bones placed a hand on Kirk's shoulder. “I think that stallion's got the right idea, Jim. Let's get you up to the <i>Enterprise</i> and get you taken care of.”</p><p>Kirk glanced at him. “I think you're right, Bones.” He looked to Kang. “I'll see you at Twilight's castle, later this evening?”</p><p>Kang nodded. He glanced down as Twilight approached. “You shall, Kirk. I am... curious as to what will transpire there.”</p><p>Twilight spoke up as she reached the two captains. “I'll tell you everything there, Captain. You won't have anything to worry about.” She stopped talking, and her eyes shifted slightly. “Well, I don't... <i>think</i> you'll have anything to worry about.”</p><p>Kang growled. “Your assurances are <i>not</i> helping, Princess.” He looked back up at Kirk. “I shall see you then. Mara will be with me.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Of course, Kang. Spock will be accompanying me... <i>there</i>.”</p><p>Kang opened his mouth, but his head shot around. “Mara, leave the pink pony alone!” He quickly thumped his chest in salute before turning and running off.</p><p>Twilight's head turned as she watched him leave. “She's gonna regret that.”</p><p>Uhura held up her tricorder. “Captain, I have the entirety of the duel recorded, as ordered.”</p><p>Bones grinned. “Well, that should be good for movie night!”</p><p>Kirk waved him off as Celestia approached. “Your highness,” he said, bowing.</p><p>Celestia returned the gesture. “You were very magnanimous towards my nephew, Captain. I thank you for that.” She looked to her side, in the general direction of Kang. “You offered him the hand of friendship, even after a bloody battle. If this can be so with Blueblood, then do your own words not apply to Kang?”</p><p>Kirk leaned back slightly. “Your highness, I have offered the 'hand of friendship', as you call it, to Kang several times over this mission. It is on... <i>him</i> to accept it.”</p><p>Celestia tilted her head from side to side. “I have often found, Captain, that those who turn it down, are those most in need of the offer.” She smiled and, before Kirk could respond, backed off. “In any event, I have matters to attend to. By your leave, Captain. I look forward to our next meeting.” With that, she turned and walked off.</p><p>Bones shook his head. “Well, gee. That wasn't mysterious or anything.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “It was quite an... interesting response, Doctor. One borne from experience, I would presume.”</p><p>Twilight stayed silent, but her eyes shifted back and forth while her muzzle scrunched slightly.</p><p>Kirk unclipped his communicator from his belt and flipped it open. “Kirk to <i>Enterprise, </i>stand by to beam up the landing party.” He turned to Twilight. “I'll contact you when Mister Spock and I are... <i>ready</i> to beam down.”</p><p>Twilight smiled. “I look forward to it, Captain. Not quite as much explaining this to Kang and Mara, but I look forward to that, too.”</p><p>Kirk exchanged a glance with Spock before raising his communicator once more. “Energize.”</p>

<p>Kang paced back and forth. He stood in the hallway just outside the room with the mirror, Kirk, Spock, Mara, and Twilight were there as well. He finally stopped in front of Twilight, crossed his arms, and glared down at her. “Let me see if I have this right. In the reality this Sunset Shimmer resides in, the entirety of the Federation, the Empire, perhaps <i>all of </i>our galaxy, we are all fiction, there?”</p><p>Twilight met his stare. “I've seen the footage, Captain. I know how insane it sounds, believe me. I've recently had my own view on the difference between reality and fiction shaken.”</p><p>Kirk spread his arms out. “Kang, there's a speech from an old play that comes to mind. 'All the world's a stage, and– ”</p><p>Mara interrupted him. “Yes, yes. Kang and I know. 'And the people, merely players'. Act II, Scene VII from 'As You Like It'. We've seen the play many times, Kirk. It <i>does</i> apply here, even if it's quite cliched.”</p><p>Spock and Kirk looked to her. Spock arched an eyebrow. “I am rather... surprised that you two are familiar with the play, Mara.”</p><p>Kang chuckled. “Of course we are, Spock! You should come with us to the First City to see it.” He glanced to Mara. “After all, you've never experienced the Bard until you've heard it in the original Klingonese.”</p><p>Kirk and Spock looked to each other. “I'm sorry, what?” Kirk asked, leaning forward.</p><p>Twilight looked inside the door. “Okay, time to form the portal. Now, Sunset talked with Trixie about this, and they both promised to be on their best behavior. Still...” Her expression softened. “Please don't be too harsh on either of them, all right? They're trying to help and, well, you're all heroes to them.” With that, she walked into the room, stood in front of the mirror, and fired a beam from her horn at the crystal atop the mirror that connected Equestria to Canterlot High.</p><p>Kang's eyes followed Twilight. “It's still... unsettling, to learn one is fiction, even if it's in another reality.” He held up a hand. “Yes, yes. I've read the reports about the Terran Empire, and what happened near the Tholian Border with the <i>Defiant</i>.” He jabbed a finger at Kirk. “But it's one thing to read dry text, and another to experience it firsthand.&quot;</p><p>Any response was cut off as two ponies, one an alicorn, the other a unicorn, emerged from the mirror. Sunset Shimmer walked out first, once more wearing her Starfleet costume. The second one, Trixie, wore a blue long-sleeved shirt, black pants, and had a large grin on her face. Trixie's suitcase floated behind them, wrapped in the distinctive glow of Sunset's magic.</p><p>Trixie's eyes whipped back and forth. “That was a lot... smoother than I thought.” Her legs stumbled slightly, but she regained her balance quickly enough. Trixie twisted her head around and looked herself over. “Just like you said, Sunset. This is...” She held up a foreleg and looked it over, eyes stopping at the hoof. The smile fell away and her eyes watered.. “Oh, no!” She hung her head. “You were right, Sunset. I <i>can't</i> perform the Vulcan Salute!”</p><p>Everyone in the hall slowly looked to Spock, who merely stood there, eyebrows raised slightly.</p><p>Sunset patted Trixie on the shoulder. “Come on, Trixie. You and I both know that won't matter.” She looked over to Twilight and nodded slightly. “Twilight, good to see you again.” She craned her neck in the general direction of the door. “Are they...”</p><p>Trixie's ears swiveled about. She followed Sunset's line of sight and began walking in the direction of the door. “Are who... do you mean...” She suddenly floated a half-foot off the floor. Trixie let out a gasp and kicked at the air. “Hey, what gives?” She grunted and her head twitched. “How do you... activate this damned horn?”</p><p>Sunset floated her back down to the ground, but kept Trixie enveloped in her magic. “Okay, first off, how did you know you have a horn?”</p><p>Trixie rolled her eyes. “I can <i>feel</i> the thing sticking out of my forehead!” She glanced at Sunset. “What, you can't feel it, or those wings?”</p><p>Sunset blinked. “Okay, I concede that point. The second is, remember what we talked about? These are <i>real</i> people, not the actors and actress. We have to treat them with respect and not be overwhelming jerks.”</p><p>Trixie swallowed. “You're... right, Sunset. Trixie-I'm sorry about that.” She looked to Twilight, eyes widening. “Oh, Twi... Princess Sparkle?”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “'Twilight' is fine, Trixie. We're all friends, after all.” She looked over her shoulder. “Captains? Mister Spock? Miss Mara? You can come in, now!”</p><p>The quartet entered the room. Sunset's cheeks colored almost immediately. Trixie, meanwhile, stood stock-still, eyes wide, and with a rather stunned expression on her face. Her mouth opened slightly, then slammed shut with an audible <i>clack</i>.</p><p>Kang looked from Trixie, to Sunset, then to Twilight. “I am Kang, son of K'naiah.”</p><p>Trixie thumped her chest with a hoof, then extended her foreleg. “ben law' batlhmey SoH, qeng, puqloD k'naiah, je tuqwIj!&quot;</p><p>Kang reflexively returned the salute. “Glory to you... Trixie Lulamoon. And to you, Sunset Shimmer.” He looked back to Trixie. &quot;Not bad, although there's still a hint of a Terran accent.&quot;</p><p>Trixie beamed.</p><p>Sunset glanced up at Kang. “Captain, sir. Twilight told me you and Mara would be told about this whole thing.” The suitcase floated forward and popped open. “If you're still a bit confused about it, don't feel bad. It's still a little murky to everyone else.” Her brow furrowed. “There's a line from a play. Perhaps you've heard of–”</p><p>Kang threw his arms up. “Are you earthers incapable of referencing anything other than Shakespeare?”</p><p>Sunset chuckled. “Fair enough, Captain. How about Lewis Carroll then: Are you the dreamer or merely a part of someone else’s dream?” Without waiting for a reply, she opened the suitcase and floated several cases cases out of it. “All right. Here we have the entirety of the Star Trek television series.” She sorted the cases into seven groups, then paused. Sunset blinked. “Trixie, that's your cue.” She looked to her right. “Trixie?”</p><p>Trixie stared up, her eyes locked on Spock. Her mouth was slightly open as she mumbled incoherently. With a start, she closed her eyes and shook her head. “Gyah, I... I am <i>so</i> sorry about that.” She looked at the cases. “Ah, these are...” She scrunched her face up in concentration. “They're divided up by series, and the movies. The Original and Animated series, those cover your five-year mission, Captain. Then there were six movies.” She paused, lowered her head, and bit her lip before continuing. “Then the Next Generation, which covers the USS <i>Enterprise</i> NCC-1701-D.”</p><p>Kirk's right eyebrow shot up. “The 'D'?” He looked to Spock, grinning. “Quite the... honor, that they kept our registry number. Wouldn't you say?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Agreed, Captain. It makes one wonder what we shall do in the future to earn such an honor.”</p><p>Trixie opened her mouth, but suddenly shoved a hoof into it. Her eyes bulged out slightly as she breathed around the hoof.</p><p>Everyone stared at her for a moment. Mara held out her tricorder and turned it on. “I'm reading an elevated heartbeat from her, as well as increased brain activity. Are you well, Miss Lulamoon?”</p><p>Sunset slowly extended a wing over Trixie. “Breathe in, breathe out. It's all right. Would you like me to continue?”</p><p>Kang grunted and crossed his arms over his chest. “To be treated in such a manner is so... undignified. Can she not control her impulses?”</p><p>Mara rolled her eyes. “And how would <i>you</i> react, dear husband, if you met Captain Koth of <i>Battlecruiser Vengeance</i>?”</p><p>Kang's countenance darkened, but he remained silent.</p><p>Trixie slowly removed her hoof. “Okay... Deep Space Nine is about a space station on the edge of Federation space. That's the one with Sisko, who you met during 'The Trouble with Tribbles'. Voyager is about a ship stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and Enterprise is about the NX-01.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Ah, Archer's ship. Required reading at the Academy.”</p><p>Kang's expression lightened slightly. “Wait... tribbles? And this was a mission the <i>Enterprise</i> was on?” At Trixie's nod, he stroked his beard. “I remember Koloth telling me about that, and that idiot spy fouling things up thanks to those damnable pests.” He shook his head, the smile falling away as quickly as it came. “Now they infest our food production worlds, and even with the glommer, we can barely keep up with exterminating them.”</p><p>Twilight's expression fell. “Oh, I'm so sorry to hear!” She rubbed her chin. “You know, we do know a thing or three about dealing with pests. If things work out, we could send some help your way.”</p><p>Kang leaned back slightly. “You would do this for us? What if negotiations do not work out?”</p><p>Twilight shrugged. “We'd still like to help. What are friends for?”</p><p>Kang stared at her, brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>Sunset, meanwhile, opened up one of the cases and gently extracted a silver disc from it. “Okay, here's the first disc. Disc one of Star Trek: the Original Series.” She turned it around and read off the episode titles. “Mister Spock, ready?”</p><p>Spock stepped forward and knelt down. He flipped his tricorder on and held its sensor wand up. “The tricorder is now ready to copy the data, Miss Shimmer.” He waved the wand over the disc while his eyes were glued to the small screen embedded in the tricorder. “This disc is finished, Miss Shimmer. The next one, please.”</p><p>Sunset floated the recorded disc back into the case and floated the next one up. She repeated the procedure, finishing the case rather quickly. “I must say, Mister Spock, that went quicker than I thought.”</p><p>Trixie nickered. “They may <i>look</i> like they were made in the 1960's, but that equipment's very advanced.” She glanced to Mara. “So... will you be recording any of this, too?” As everyone looked to her, she shrugged. “What?”</p><p>Kang nodded to her. “She has a point. I am glad to have been let known of this, but are we to have this information, too? Is there anything of value for the Empire?”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie exchanged a look. “Considering what's coming down the pipe, I think it'd be a good idea,” Trixie said.</p><p>Sunset looked up at Kang. “And there's other, more... personal stuff.” She sucked in a breath. “Kang, Mara, in the future... an albino Klingon pirate will kill your child, along with the children of Koloth, and Kor.”</p><p>Kang and Mara exchanged a look. Kang slowly shook his head. “We have no son.”</p><p>Kirk stepped to Kang's side. “Kang, I may be missing something here, but this is your... <i>son</i>! How can you dismiss him like that?”</p><p>Kang slowly looked to Kirk. “I spoke literally, Kirk. Mara and I have talked about it, but we have no children.” His expression changed to one of surprise, with more than a little shock. “A son? We'll have a son!” His mouth turned up in a wide grin. “A son, to carry on my name! A son...” He spun about and dropped to one knee in front of Sunset. “What do you two know about what he will do to our children?”</p><p>Sunset's gaze turned distant for a moment. “In 2290, you three will break up his power base, but fail to capture or kill him. In revenge, he'll infect your children with a genetic virus through you. His name is Qagh. A key component of the virus comes from Omega IV.” She sucked in a breath and slowly turned her head to her right. “Captain Kirk, I feel it appropriate to tell you, he'll try and infect Hikaru Sulu to strike at his future daughter Demora. Fortunately, he'll turn out to be immune to it, due to having been exposed to elements of it on Omega IV.” A book with the title 'Forged in Fire' floated out of the suitcase, along with another case. “A lot of information is here, along with an episode of Deep Space Nine.” The case opened and a disc detached itself from its holder.</p><p>Spock spoke up. “Captain, I believe it necessary to make all attempts to stop this 'Qagh' and safeguard Mister Sulu from any potential harm.”</p><p>Mara's face twisted in rage. Her free hand clenched, tight enough so that blood dribbled down the palm of her hand. She abruptly stood up. “I will find this albino, carve his heart out, and eat it in front of him as he dies!”</p><p>Kang placed a hand on Mara's shoulder. “No, Mara. <i>We</i> will carve his heart out together.”</p><p>Sunset slowly nodded. “That sounds–” Her head shot around to Twilight's direction. The princess' head was down slightly, eyes narrowed. “Ah, Twilight?”</p><p>Trixie cantered around to Twilight's side. She leaned in close. “Twilight, are you... all right? I know their reaction might seem a bit... extreme.”</p><p>Kang's face flushed. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Trixie continued. “This <i>is</i> their culture, though. And the Albino's threatening their family.”</p><p>Twilight's head slowly rose. “Yes?” She looked from Trixie to Sunset. “I fully understand their reactions. This albino threatens their future children because they dared to stop him being a pirate.” She paused in thought. “A few years ago, my brother was getting married to Princess Cadance. There were some... problems in the planning and preparation. Long story short, I thought Cadance was using Shiny for some nefarious purposes. It turns out the pony I <i>thought</i> was Cadance was an impostor–again, long story. But one I'll tell.” She sucked in a breath. “When I found Cadance–the <i>real</i> Cadance, I was fully ready to blow a hole in her head. Fortunately, she convinced me she was the real one, but I can still understand how they feel.”</p><p>Sunset stared at her for a long moment. “Wow, Twilight. That's... not exactly what I expected you to say.”</p><p>Twilight looked to her,winking. “I'm a little more open to other ways of thinking than you might think.” She looked back up at Kang and Mara. “No matter what, you've got friends here in Equestria that will help you and any future children you'll have. You have my word of honor on that.”</p><p>Kirk spoke up. “Kang, Mara... if there's any help I can offer, any at all, I too offer it. No one should... <i>lose</i> their child. Especially not like that.”</p><p>Trixie bit her lip, her cheeks puffing out. Sunset eyed her, but remained silent for the moment.</p><p>Kang slowly turned to fully face Kirk. He stared at the captain, expression as neutral as possible. “We would... not be averse to your aid, Captain. Not in a matter like this.”</p><p>Trixie's took a step forward. “Captain, you may keep my copy, if you need to. I don't know how long you or Mara would need to read through it, or how we'd be able to arrange it to get back to me. So please keep it, as a gift.” She looked to Sunset. “Could you, please? I don't trust myself not to hurl the book into their faces.”</p><p>Sunset's horn glowed, and the book floated over to Kang. He snatched it in midair and began rifling through the pages. “Can you read English?” she asked.</p><p>Kang snorted. “We <i>do</i> have universal translators, Sunset Shimmer.” He closed it and looked down at her. “But yes, I can read this.” He glanced to Kirk. “As a rather wise human once said, 'know your enemies'.”</p><p>Sunset looked to Trixie, who was still biting her lip. “Captain Kirk, first off, I believe it would be advisable for Mara to be able to copy the information on the discs. There's information there about the Empire, and I... do trust at least the two of them enough to be able to deal with the information properly.”</p><p>Kirk slowly nodded. “I... also trust Captain Kang in this regard, to... <i>do</i> the right thing.” He motioned to Mara. “I won't stop you.”</p><p>For the next several minutes, Mara and Spock waved their tricorder's sensor wands over the discs from Trixie's collections. After the last disc's information was copied, the two stood up. Spock flipped his tricorder flap closed and looked to Kirk. “Captain, with your permission, I shall prepare this information to be sent to Starfleet Command upon arrival on the <i>Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>Kirk rubbed his chin. “Yes, Mister Spock. However... make an additional copy, and keep that one... on board.” He half-smiled. “Just for safekeeping.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Understood, Captain.”</p><p>Kang activated his communicator. <i>“Pride</i>, prepare for transport.” He held the book up. “Thank you for this. Mara and I are in your debt.”</p><p>Kirk held a hand up. “Kang, I would like to read that book, too. After you're done with it. Sulu's life may be in... <i>jeopardy</i> as well. As well as the life of his daughter.”</p><p>Kang glanced up, eyes somewhat wide. He looked at the book, then to Kirk. “You shall have this in your hand before my ship leaves the Equus System. I swear that to you, Kirk.” He activated his communicator once more. “Energize.”</p><p>As the two Klingons transported away, Kirk knelt down. “Trixie, Sunset, I... <i>thank you</i> for this invaluable information. I'm not fully sure how it will be used, but rest assured. This won't be thrown or... <i>filed</i> away, to gather dust somewhere.”</p><p>Sunset stared at Kirk, eyes wide. “Thank you, Captain. I think I can speak for Trixie and myself when I say it means a <i>lot</i> to us to hear you say that.”</p><p>Trixie's head bobbed up and down. “Yes, yes! She <i>does</i> speak for me, Captain! I am <i>so</i> glad to help you and meet you and Mister Spock and I just want to tell you how awesome and cool you two are! I still remember the first time...” Her voice trailed off. She sniffed and wiped her eyes. “Trixie is sorry. That was... stupid of me to say.” She walked over to the mirror, head hung low and cheeks burning.</p><p>Sunset grinned sheepishly, her own face slightly blushed. “Sorry about that. Trixie really does look up to you, and to the entire crew. This is... kind of restrained compared to how she was on the other side of the mirror.” She walked over to Trixie, leaned in close, and draped a wing over her.</p><p>Kirk shook his head. “As I said before, Miss Shimmer, there's no apology necessary.” He smiled. “Better than hating us, at least.” He turned his head. “Don't you agree, Spock?”</p><p>Spock nodded to Kirk. “A logical outlook at it, Captain. One I agree with.”</p><p>Sunset looked to her right, and the mirror. “Maybe it's time we go back to our own reality? I think for the moment, we've done all we can.”</p><p>Trixie's head bobbed up and down slightly, but her eyes remained transfixed on the floor.</p><p>Kirk stood up. “Very well, Sunset. I do... <i>thank</i> you both, again, for doing this.”</p><p>Twilight's horn lit up as she reactivated the mirror. She hugged Sunset, and patted Trixie on the back. “Thanks for doing this, you two. Trixie?” She waited for Trixie's head to tilt up slightly before continuing. “My personal hero is a unicorn named Star Swirl the Bearded. I think if I met him in the flesh, I'd fanfilly over him even more than you.”</p><p>Trixie nickered. “Thank you, Twilight.” She glanced in Kirk and Spock's general direction. “I'll get you a copy of that book if I can. And... Mister Spock?”</p><p>Spock took a step forward. “Yes, Miss Lulamoon?”</p><p>Trixie sucked in a shuddery breath. “Some of the things from later installments of the franchise will be a bit... shocking to you, and to Captain Kirk, and to others.”</p><p>Spock slowly nodded. “I shall keep that in mind. Thank you.”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie walked through the vortex in the mirror, vanishing from Equestria. A half-second later, the vortex itself vanished, separating the realities once more.</p><p>Spock held his tricorder up. “Captain, when we return to the <i>Enterprise</i>, I shall begin an immediate analysis of this data.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. He looked down at Twilight, rubbing his chin. “Twilight... would it be possible for you to cross through the mirror without anyone on the other side... <i>noticing</i> your arrival?”</p><p>Twilight eyed him. “I suppose... but why?”</p><p>Kirk explained his idea. With each word, Twilight's expression brightened. “I'll do my best,” she said, smiling brightly.</p><p>Kirk unclipped his communicator from his belt and flipped it open. “Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>, stand by to beam up landing party.” He bowed his head to Twilight. “By your leave?”</p><p>Twilight chuckled and returned the bow. “By my leave, Captain. Bye for now.”</p><p>Kirk smiled. “Thank you. <i>Enterprise, </i>Energize.”</p>

<p>Kirk made his way to Briefing Room Three, PADD in hand. It was the next day, by ship-time, and the Alpha-Shift was soon to start. He slowed down slightly as Spock appeared at an intersection. “Mister Spock, good morning,” he said, as he resumed his normal gait, Spock right by his side. “How goes the... research? Any spoilers?”</p><p>Spock glanced to Kirk. “I believe it would be more prudent to wait until the meeting, Captain. Miss Lulamoon and Miss Shimmer were both correct that there would be shocking things in later installments.”</p><p>Any further conversation was curtailed as they stopped entered the briefing room. Bones and Scotty were already sitting and conversing. A few seconds later, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov walked in. All seven officers sat around at a table in the center of the room. Kirk spoke first. “Now, then. Mister Spock, you have a... report on the information from the television show?”</p><p>Bones leaned forward. “Been looking forward to that. I wonder what handsome devil they got to play me?” he asked, smirking.</p><p>Spock looked across the table at Bones. “For the record, Doctor, DeForest Kelley played your character.” He slid a data card into a slot on the table. A three-screened monitor in the center lit up. “By viewing the episodes at twice the normal speed, and with subtitles activated, I was able to view fifteen episodes of the original live-action series, several episodes of the animated series whose descriptions matched incidents which have already occurred, and the first three movies.” He paused for a moment. “The episodes I have viewed, barring technical limitations of the media and time period they were made in, have a close to ninety-nine percent match to the events that happened in our reality.”</p><p>While Spock spoke, the three screens lit up, showing images of a model of the <i>Enterprise</i> flying by a planet, then changing to what appeared to be the bridge. Or at least, a set made up like the <i>Enterprise's</i> bridge.</p><p>Sulu leaned forward. “So, it's true!” He looked up, face ashen. “Demora,” he whispered.</p><p>Kirk held up a hand. “Sulu, we'll do whatever is necessary to... <i>safeguard</i> her. And you.”</p><p>Sulu nodded. “Thank you, Captain. If it would be all right, I'd like to send a message to my family after my shift.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head. “No, Mister Sulu. You may send your message... after the <i>meeting </i>is over. This isn't something to be delayed.”</p><p>Sulu's expression brightened, if only a little. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>Uhura leaned in and looked at the monitor facing her. “Mister Spock, I'm not seeing any non-humans in these images. Present company excepted, though.”</p><p>Chekov shrugged. “Well, as Mister Spock said, it's probably technical limitations of the time.” He raised his hand and waggled a finger. “Now, if this show was made in Russia, it would be indistinguishable from us.”</p><p>Uhura glanced at him. “We'll keep that in mind, Pavel.”</p><p>Sulu leaned forward and peered at the monitor. “If I remember, at the time period this show was made, there were no computer-generated graphics. It was all practical effects, make-up, that sort of thing.”</p><p>Spock slid the card out of the slot, then held up another one. He looked to Kirk. “Captain, the first three movies contain some rather important information about future events. This information could prove vital to the survival of the Federation. However, before I proceed, some of the information is somewhat … sensitive and personal in nature. I would like your permission before proceeding.”</p><p>Kirk hesitated for a moment, but waved him on. “Go ahead, Spock. The... future of the Federation is too important.”</p><p>Bones spoke up. “Jim, you sure? I mean, if Spock's thinking of asking your permission about it, I wouldn't take it too lightly.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head. “I appreciate that, Bones, but Spock said it could prove... <i>vital</i> to the security of the Federation. I can take a little discomfort.” He looked to Spock. “Go ahead, Spock.”</p><p>Spock inserted another card into the table’s slot. “The first movie deals with an ancient space probe from Earth known as Voyager Six. It had apparently fallen through a wormhole, emerged on the other side of the galaxy, and was discovered by an alien civilization of living machines. They upgraded the probe, then sent it on its way. Even as I speak, it seeks to return to the source of its creation, to ask of its creators, <i>why</i> it was created.”</p><p>Uhura tapped a fingernail on the table. “The most basic question of all. ‘Who am I’?”</p><p>Spock nodded to her. “Correct, Commander.” He looked to Kirk. “The <i>Enterprise</i> will be sent to intercept V’Ger three years from now, on stardate 7410.2. It is impossible to fight, Captain. However, the movies shows it possible to communicate with V’Ger. That is our best, and only real option available to us.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “I agree, Spock. Work on that as best you can. Maybe we can talk to Trixie or Sunset Shimmer, get some more details, if any.”</p><p>Spock paused for a moment before continuing. “The next movie takes place on and around stardate 8130.3. It is called <i>The Wrath of Khan</i>.” While he spoke, the monitor changed to show the image of a much older Khan Noonien Singh.</p><p>Kirk leaned forward. “Wrath of… of <i>Khan</i>, Spock?” His hand waved a bit in the air. “What in the… Great Bird of the Galaxy happened?”</p><p>Spock slid out one card and replaced it with another. The image changed to that of a star system. He pressed several buttons on a control panel next to the slot. It zoomed in on two planets in close proximity to each other. “Approximately six months you exiled Khan to Ceti Alpha V, Ceti Alpha <i>VI</i> exploded, shifting the orbit of the former and devastating the ecosystem.”</p><p>Sulu glanced down at the monitor. “That means he spent… eighteen years living in a wasteland. And we never checked up on him.” He looked up at Spock. “How did he get off the planet? And what did he do?”</p><p>“The USS <i>Reliant</i> was sent there as part of Project: Genesis,” Spock responded. “Due to the incomplete mapping of the system, they will mistake Ceti Alpha V for the destroyed VI. He’ll hijack the ship and take it to Regula I in an attempt to steal the Genesis device.”</p><p>Kirk’s brow furrowed. “‘Genesis Device’?”</p><p>Spock laced his fingers together. “It is the key to Project: Genesis, a new form of terraforming. It is headed by Doctor Carol Marcus… and David Marcus.”</p><p>Kirk’s face turned ashen. “Carol… and David Marcus?”</p><p>Bones’ brow furrowed. “Jim, you all right?”</p><p>Kirk glanced in Bones’ general direction, his eyes focused more on some spot in the past than his friend. “Gary Mitchell… introduced me to a little blond lab technician once.” A small smile briefly crossed his face. “I almost <i>married</i> her.” He focused on Bones. “Carol and I had a son. David, as you should be able to… guess. We both realized we loved our careers more than each other, so we agreed to separate. And that it would be better for her to raise David instead of me.”</p><p>Bones tilted his head back and forth. “Reasonable decision, all things considered. My ex-wife and I reached the same conclusion about our child, Joanna.” He slapped his hands on the table. “Well, what are we waiting for?”</p><p>Everyone looked to Bones. “Waiting for what, Doctor?” Spock asked, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>Bones stared across the table at Spock, eyes wide. “What in God’s name do you think I’m talking about, Spock? We’ve got to go and rescue those people! If not us, then at least another ship!”</p><p>Spock spoke. “And do what with them Doctor? We must consider our options before deciding on a course of action.”</p><p>Kirk held up a hand and spoke before Bones could. “Calm down, Bones. I agree with you. Leaving them there <i>would</i> be cruel. They haven’t done anything yet. Still, if we go in without some sort of plan, it’s possible the events of the movie would simply happen far earlier. We’ll do <i>something</i>, but we’ll try and make sure it’s the best thing.”</p><p>Bones opened his mouth, but stopped short of speaking. He finally nodded. “Well, all right, then.”</p><p>Kirk glanced to Spock. “Anything else concerning this movie?”</p><p>Spock nodded slightly. “The ship that will be hijacked by Kahn and his followers is the USS <i>Reliant</i>. It appears to be a <i>Miranda</i>-class starship, albeit one that has undergone extensive upgrades.” He looked across the table. “Mister Chekov will be the ship’s first officer. Our current transporter chief, Winston Kyle, is the <i>Reliant’s</i> second officer.”</p><p>Chekov grinned. “Me? First officer?” He shrugged. “Of course!” The grin fell away. “Wait, what happens to me–I mean, to my character?” He paused for a moment. “And to… Mister Kyle. Of course.”</p><p>Spock directed a withering glare at the young officer. “Mister Kyle and most of the <i>Reliant </i>crew were stranded on Ceti Alpha V. Kahn will use a parasite known as a Ceti eel to coerce you and the ship’s captain to aid him in his rampage.” He paused for the slightest of moments, so short that only those who knew him best would detect it. “Kahn will eventually be stopped in the Mutara Nebula, but the cost will be high. Among those killed will be myself.”</p><p>Bones’ eyes widened to the approximate width of saucers. He <i>slammed </i>a hand on the table, sending everyone jumping. “What the <i>hell, </i>Spock? You <i>die</i> because of this? How in God’s name can you sit there so calmly, reading that?” He looked to Kirk. “Jim, by God, we’ve <i>got</i> to stop this!”</p><p>Kirk <i>launched</i> to his feet. “Bones, calm down. That’s an <i>order</i>!” He looked to Spock. He held up his hand, even as the other five occupants readied themselves to speak. “Calm down, calm down! We won’t get anything accomplished by… talking over each other, or losing our heads.” His head turned sharply in Spock’s direction. “Mister Spock, barring anything urgent, you are to finish as many episodes and movies as possible and get a report ready on what your recommended courses of action are. Talk with whoever you have to, use whatever resources you deem necessary, but I want that report in twenty-four hours. Understood?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “Understood Captain.” he glanced across the table. “Doctor McCoy, I do thank you for your… passion in making sure I survive. However, if necessary, I will sacrifice myself. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”</p><p>Bones grunted. “Maybe so, but if there’s no need to, then you shouldn’t <i>have</i> to sacrifice yourself. It would be… illogical to waste such a resource as the finest first officer in the fleet.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “A very astute observation, Doctor.”</p><p>Kirk barked a mirthless laugh. “Now I think I see why neither Sunset nor Trixie wished to… <i>divulge</i> this information publicly.” He glanced around the table. “All right. We’ve all got work to do. Mister Scott, Princess Sparkle and some of her friends will be taking a tour of the <i>Enterprise</i> later today. That will probably include Main Engineering.”</p><p>Scotty groaned. “Aye, sir. I’ll make sure all the breakables are put away.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “Good idea. Dismissed.”</p><p>Five of the seven occupants of the room rose from the table and made their way to the door. Uhura placed a hand on Sulus’s shoulder. “Hikaru, before you leave for the Equus System, I’ll set up a real-time transmission with your family.”</p><p>Hikaru smiled at her. “Thanks, Nyota.”</p><p>Kirk watched them go. He glanced down at Spock, still sitting at the table. “Spock, the third movie. I’m guessing what happened there is even… <i>worse</i>. What happened in it?”</p><p>Spock glanced up, failing to meet Kirk’s eyes. “Captain, if we are able to prevent the actions of Kahn in the second movie, then there is a ninety-nine percent chance that the third movie will fail to come to pass.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Understood. What happened?”</p><p>Spock slowly rose to his feet. “Khan will have detonated the Genesis Device inside the Mutara Nebula, creating a new world.”</p><p>Kirk’s brow furrowed. “A new… <i>world</i>?”</p><p>Spock nodded. “It is… complicated. Moving on, my body will have been given a burial in space. It will land on the planet, and it will… be regenerated and brought back to life. You will be instructed by my father to go and retrieve my body. The reasons would be… personal. And dealing with rather private matters of Vulcan culture.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Fair enough, Spock. All things willing I won’t need to know what those private matters… <i>entail</i>.” His expression darkened. “All right, Spock. What is it? I’ve known you too long and too well not to know when you’re hiding… <i>something</i>.”</p><p>“If the timeline is not altered from the events of the movie,” Spock began, “then you and the other senior officers will hijack the <i>Enterprise</i> and take it to the Genesis planet. There, it will encounter a Klingon bird of prey. That bird of prey will have already destroyed the USS <i>Grissom</i>, stranding a Lieutenant Saavik and David there.</p><p>“The Klingon captain, Kruge, will order one his men to kill one of their prisoners. David will attack the Klingon before he chooses, sacrificing his life to save Saavik’s.”</p><p>The color drained from Kirk’s face. He stepped back, his hip brushing against the table. Spock’s arm snaked out as he grabbed Kirk’s right arm before the captain could fall to the deck. He almost gently helped Kirk to the chair. “Klingon… killed my son… killed my son…” he mumbled, eyes unfocused.</p><p>Spock stood there, hand on Kirk’s shoulder. “Captain… Jim, I am sorry for this news. With the knowledge we have, the odds that the exact same events will play out are rapidly dwindling. At the moment, I cannot even calculate such odds.”</p><p>Kirk glanced up, eyes not quite focusing on Spock. He forced a smile. “Thank you, Spock. I’ll… keep that in mind. Anything else at the moment?”</p><p>Spock paused. “At the moment… no, Captain. Permission to return to the viewing?”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Granted, Spock. And… thank you.” He sat there as Spock left, body listless. He barely registered the intercom whistle. After a moment, he finally stood up and walked over to a comm panel in the bulkhead. “Kirk.”</p><p><i>“Captain, Lieutenant M’ress here. We’re receiving a signal from the </i>Pride<i>. Captain Kang wishes to speak with you.”</i></p><p>Kirk nodded. “Thank you, Lieutenant. Put him through.”</p><p>Kang’s voice came through the speaker. “<i>Kirk, I have copied the complete text of the book Trixie Lulamoon gave me. When you are ready, I shall have it beamed over to the </i>Enterprise<i>.”</i></p><p>Kirk’s mouth quirked upward. “Thank you, Kang. We’ll put it to good use.”</p><p><i>“Excellent. Kirk… I have perused some of the theatrical releases. Nothing major; that’s what Mara and Kina are doing. However, something has caught my attention. Tell me, Kirk. Do you wish to know of a Klingon captain named Kruge?”</i></p><p>Kirk stiffened. “What are you… offering, Kang?”</p><p><i>“As you said, no one should experience the pain of losing their child. You offered to aid me to protect my future son. I offer </i>you<i> aid in protecting your son. Will you accept?”</i></p><p>Kirk straightened up, his eyes lit with an inner fire. “I accept, Kang. And I thank you.”</p>

<p>Twilight and Rainbow Dash stood outside the Castle of Friendship, both of their heads tilted up and their eyes scanning the sky. A black suitcase floated next to Twilight, but beyond that, there was nothing or no one about.“Is he here, yet?” Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p>A groan escaped Twilight. “No, Commander Sulu isn't here yet. Ask me that again, and you're flying up there yourself!” She held up a hoof in front of Rainbow Dash's muzzle. “And I mean it!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's wings bristled, but she remained silent.</p><p>Movement from the castle caught their attention. They both turned as Cadance emerged from the front door. She trotted over to the pair, smiling. “Hi, you two. Think there's enough room on the shuttle for one more?”</p><p>Twilight met her halfway, wrapping her forelegs around Cadance's neck in a hug. “Of course!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash walked over. “Hey, the more the merrier! The <i>Enterprise</i> can only get cooler with us three aboard.” She glanced to the door. “What about Shining Armor?”</p><p>Cadance broke the hug and looked to Dash. “Oh, he decided to stay behind. Something else came up that he wanted to attend.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's mouth dropped open in shock. “What the feathering hay would he want to 'attend' to more than going to tour a <i>starship</i> in orbit?”</p><hr/><p>“<i>Okay, Shiny. Roll for initiative!”</i></p><p>“<i>Sure thing, Spike. And thanks for inviting me to your game. You too, Big Mac.”</i></p><p>“<i>Eyup!”</i></p><hr/><p>“Oh, you know stallions,” Cadance finally said, eyes not quite meeting Rainbow Dash's.</p><p>Twilight's head shot up towards the sky. She hopped into the air, wings fluttering. “It's coming!” she shouted, grinning.</p><p>A small dot in the sky appeared, rapidly growing into a boxy, gray-hulled shuttle with two nacelles attached to the bottom. It slowed down as it approached, stopping a few meters above the ground. It dropped down, landing without disturbing a single blade of grass below its hull. The side hatch slid open and Commander Sulu emerged. He stepped down onto the ground and sketched a bow. “Your chariot awaits.”</p><p>Twilight grinned. “Thank you, Commander.” She waved a wing at Cadance. “Oh, is it all right if Cadance comes?”</p><p>Sulu looked to Cadance, “Of course, Princess. The more the merrier!” He motioned to the hatch. “Anyone else joining, or just you three?”</p><p>Twilight looked about. With the exception of the four there, no one else was about. “Looks like it's just us.” She floated her suitcase up and let it trail behind as she, Rainbow Dash, and Cadance boarded the shuttle.</p><p>Inside were several chairs fastened to the deck. The pilot and copilot seats were right in front of a large viewport, along with several control consoles and panels. Twilight walked up to one and climbed into it, the suitcase sliding under the chair itself. She looked around, spotted the safety harness hanging from the chair's frame, and grabbed it with her magic. She looked around for some sort of latch or tab to secure it to, but nothing stood out to her. She looked up as Sulu entered the shuttle and sealed the door behind him. “Commander?” She motioned to the harness. “This seems to be broken. Could–”</p><p>Sulu stepped around, grabbed the harness' buckles, adjusted them for Twilight’s body, and fastened them to several discrete hardpoints on the chair. He stood back up and looked it over. “It takes some practice,” he said, smiling. “Anything else?”</p><p>Twilight shrank down slightly, even as Rainbow Dash's snickering could be heard. “I... think I'm all set. Thank you.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash hopped up and landed in a chair next to Twilight's. She grabbed at the harness with her wingtips, bringing it about and attempting to fasten herself in. The buckles, however, slipped out of her grasp. She growled as she reached for the harness again, only for it to once more slip out of her grasp. “Bucking, feathering horse apples,” she muttered, twisting around in her seat. The buckles suddenly floated up and around, blue magic enveloping them. They clicked into place and fastened her in. “Thanks, Cadance,” she mumbled.</p><p>Cadance looked over from her own chair. “You're welcome, Rainbow Dash. Just watch your language, please. We <i>are</i> representing Equestria, after all.”</p><p>Sulu chuckled as he powered up the shuttle's engines. “I've heard a <i>lot</i> worse from actual ambassadors and diplomats, your highness.” He flipped several switches, then leaned forward and looked down at a viewscreen. “Liftoff in T-minus ten seconds... five seconds... and liftoff!”</p><p>The shuttle lifted off the ground and pirouetted in midair before shooting off into the sky. It dwindled to a point, then vanished.</p><p>Rainbow Dash gasped. “Holy feather, we are <i>moving</i>!”</p><p>The sky outside the viewport quickly darkened, changing from bright-blue to dark, then to the deepest black. The stars appeared, shining steadily in the sky. Sulu pulled down on a slider and checked the astrogator. “And we have left the atmosphere.” He turned and looked to his passengers. “Go ahead and unstrap yourself, but please take care not to do anything rash. We <i>are</i> in space, now. And it can be very dangerous.”</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed. She slowly unclipped the harness that held her in the chair, then slid down onto the deck plating. “Artificial gravity,” she said, her eyes narrowing. “Impressive. I know some gravity-manipulation spells, but this is much more stable.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash cleared her throat. “Ah, Twilight? Little help, please?” She motioned to her own harness.</p><p>A smirk crossed Twilight's muzzle, but she used her magic to undo Rainbow Dash's harness. “Just remember what Commander Sulu said.” She flew up and jabbed a hoof at Dash. “No foaling around! I've done research on what vacuum exposure can do to living tissue. It is <i>not</i> pretty.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's head bobbed up and down. “In this case, Twi, no worries.” She waved a wing in front of her. “Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!”</p><p>Sulu glanced back over his shoulder from from the pilot's seat. “That sounds like it could get messy.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash barked a laugh. “Don't tell that to Pinkie Pie!” Her smile faded as her gaze fell upon the main viewport. Her eyes widened. “Is that...”</p><p>Sulu motioned to the copilot's chair, currently unoccupied. “Go right ahead. I've locked down the controls on that side.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash barely paid Sulu any mind as she floated up to the viewport, Twilight and Cadance joining her. All three shared similar expressions of wonder as they gazed down at the planet Equus. Large sections of the planet itself were obscured by clouds, but there were still large swaths of the central continent visible. Jagged mountains cut through the land, slicing through patches of brown, of green, and of yellow. Oceans ringed the land mass, disappearing around the horizon.</p><p>Rainbow Dash looked around. “The stars... they're not twinkling.”</p><p>Twilight slowly nodded. “The atmosphere distorts their light, producing that. What we're seeing now is pure starlight. It's so beautiful.”</p><p>Cadance's eyes narrowed. “I... I can't believe how beautiful this is.” She looked to Sulu. “Commander, is this how it is for you?” She blinked and shook her head. “I mean, is it...”</p><p>Sulu looked out the viewport. He settled back in his chair. “I understand, your highness. No, the wonder never <i>really</i> goes way for me. Sometimes it lurks below the surface, but it's always there.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash squinted. “Hey, where's Ponyville? Where's Cloudsdale or... or Canterlot?” She looked to Twilight. “Are we <i>really</i> that far up?”</p><p>A small smile crossed Sulu's lips. “We are indeed, Rainbow Dash. Kind of puts things into a bit of perspective, doesn't it.” He turned a dial on his console. “Now, this shuttle has warp capability. Short-range, but it <i>can</i> hit warp two.” He looked to the three, grinning. “Would you like to take a short trip before going to the <i>Enterprise</i>?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash gasped. “Oh my gosh oh my gosh, really?” She turned to Twilight and Cadance, hooves pressed together in front of her chest. “Please, can we go? It would be <i>so cool</i> to fly faster than light!”</p><p>Twilight's head bobbed up and down. “Oh, yes!” She leaned to her left and looked directly at Sulu. “Please, Commander, make it so!”</p><p>Sulu pressed a button on the console and leaned in close to a microphone. “Shuttle <i>Copernicus</i> to <i>Enterprise. </i>Slight change of plans. I'll be taking the shuttle on a short trip outside the solar system to demonstrate warp flight to my passengers.&quot;</p><p>M'ress' voice came out of a speaker grille, somewhat tinny and distorted. <i>“Understood,</i> Copernicus.<i> Safe flight</i>.”</p><p>Sulu's glanced at the others. “Watch this,” he said, his hands dancing over the controls. The planet fell away to starboard as the shuttle turned to deep space. The stars suddenly stretched out to impossibly long lengths, briefly changing color from white to multi-colored streaks. There was a flash of bright-white light, and the streaks changed to white, streaking by.</p><p>All three ponies gasped. Rainbow Dash suddenly looked herself over. “Wait, I'm not feeling it!”</p><p>Cadance glanced at her, a confused expression on her face. “Not feeling what?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash tapped the deck plating. “I mean, the effects of how insanely fast we're going. You know, acceleration?”</p><p>Twilight gasped. “She's right!” She looked to Cadance. “You know, when you fly fast, you feel G-forces pressing against you. Faster you go, the more extreme they are.” She glanced to the ceiling. “Let me see, warp two, that's eight times the speed of light. So we're going...” Her ears shot straight up and her eyes widened. “One million, four hundred-eight thousand miles per second.”</p><p>Sulu nodded. “That's right, Twilight. Our artificial gravity-control allows us to counteract almost all the extreme G-forces. Sometimes there's a bit of a lag, but by and large it works.”</p><p>Cadance slowly shook her head. “There's so much we can learn from you.”</p><p>Sulu nodded. “Yes. And there's a lot the Federation can learn from you, too.”</p><p>After about twenty minutes, Sulu cut the power to the warp drive. The streaks outside snapped back into steady, shining stars. “And there we are. Deep space.”</p><p>A bark of laughter suddenly escaped Rainbow Dash. She brought her front hooves up to her muzzle as the laughter continued. “Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! I am officially the fastest pegasus <i>ever</i>!”</p><p>Cadance nickered. “Well, technically you're only <i>riding</i> in the shuttle, Rainbow Dash. You're not even piloting it.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash waved a wing at her. “Still counts!” She slowly turned to Sulu. “Although, Commander? Would–”</p><p>Sulu rolled his eyes and shook his head. “No, Rainbow Dash. You can't fly the shuttle.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's entire body slumped. Her head drooped. Her ears folded against her head, and her wings retracted tight against her body. “Aww,” she said, kicking slightly at the deck plating.</p><p>Sulu swiveled his chair around and fully faced Rainbow Dash. “Well, when we get to the <i>Enterprise</i>, would you like to try a simulator run? It won't be quite the same as the actual shuttle, but it's the next best thing.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's ears twitched. “Can you program a meteor shower for me to fly through?”</p><p>Sulu snorted. “I think we can manage.” He turned back to the control console. “Now, then. Let's turn this ship around and see where we came from.”</p><p>He slid a dial on the astrogator. The star field outside the viewport slid to the left, slowing and stopping. Sulu checked several displays, then stood up and pointed to a star near the center of the viewport. “And... that is the Equus System.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash leaned forward, eyes narrowing as she looked at the small pinprick of light. “It's so, so small,” she finally said.</p><p>Twilight looked around at the various stars. “If you hadn't told me which one was ours, I wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.” She slowly held up a hoof. “All I know is there. Everyone, every<i>thing</i> is there.”</p><p>Cadance draped a wing over Twilight. “You okay?”</p><p>Twilight leaned into Cadance. “Yeah, thanks.”</p><p>Sulu leaned back in his chair. He drummed his fingers on the console for a second before speaking. “'Every saint and sinner, in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended on a sunbeam.'”</p><p>Twilight's head shot around. “What?”</p><p>Sulu straightened up slightly. “Sorry, Princess. It's...” He trailed off for a moment before continuing. “In February of 1990, two hundred seventy-nine years ago, an ancient Earth probe known as Voyager I was instructed to take a picture of Earth as it hurtled out of the Sol System. Voyager I was about six <i>billion</i> miles away at the time, so Earth was a small dot barely distinguishable from the rest of the image. It became known as the 'Pale Blue Dot' image. I quoted part of a speech delivered in 1994 about that photograph. Those words were written by a man named Carl Sagan.” He slowly smiled as he stared out the viewport, at the stars, at some distant point. “You could say he was the torchbearer, showing us our place in the stars.” He let out a sigh and slumped a bit. “God, what I wouldn't give to have met him.”</p><p>Twilight's brow furrowed. “Well...”</p><p>Sulu glanced down at her. “Yes, Princess?”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “Nothing, nothing! Sorry, just thinking out loud.” She nickered and pointed at the dot of light representing her home. “Time to go back?”</p><p>Sulu nodded. “All right, back to the Equus System.” He set the controls. “And... engage.”</p><p>The stars outside once more stretched as the shuttle hit warp two. And once more, the three ponies stared in rapt fascination. “I have so got to take a look at main engineering during the tour,” Twilight said, mouth open.</p><p>Sulu chuckled. “Ask Scotty nicely and he might let you look over his technical manuals.”</p><p>Twilight's head shot over, wings extending slightly. “Really, Commander? Technical manuals?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash slapped her face with a hoof. “Ho, boy. We've lost Twilight, now.”</p><p>Cadance cleared her throat, getting Twilight's attention. “Remember he said 'nicely', Twilight. Be polite, and understanding if he says no.”</p><p>Twilight's head bobbed up and down. “Right, right! No pressing, needling or begging. Even though those manuals would teach me <i>all</i> I'd need to know about building my own warp drive.” Twilight's right eye began twitching, and parts of her mane started springing up.</p><p>Cadance placed a hoof on Twilight's shoulder. “Twilight... <i>breathe</i>. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Remember?”</p><p>Sulu looked over at Twilight and Cadance. “Are you all right, Princess?”</p><p>Twilight's nostrils flared as she breathed in, her mouth pursing slightly as she breathed out. She reached up and smoothed her mane back down. “I'm all right, Commander. Thank you for asking. Won't happen again!”</p><p>Sulu's gaze lingered on her for a moment before he turned back to his console. “Good to hear, Princess.” He glanced down at the astrogator. “Because we're coming out of warp... now.”</p><p>The star field outside reverted to normal, the planet Equus centered in the viewport. It gradually drifted to the right. A small, silver shape, somewhat indistinct, appeared. It rapidly grew in size as the <i>Copernicus</i> flew towards it, a disc-like primary hull dominating. A cylinder-shaped engineering hull trailed back, a neck connecting the two. Twin nacelles jutted out from the engineering hull's aft, red hemispheres at the fore that crackled with energy. It flew above Equus, its bright-white hull, red-and-green running lights, and gold deflector dish all shining brightly, proudly, proclaiming to all that saw her that this was a <i>starship</i>.</p><p>Rainbow Dash let out a small gasp. Is that the <i>Enterprise?”</i></p><p>Sulu grinned, his own enthusiasm shining almost as brightly. “Indeed it is. NCC-1701, <i>Constitution</i>-class heavy cruiser. There's not a finer ship in the Milky Way Galaxy.”</p><p>Twilight's own eyes shone. “It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,” she whispered.</p><p>The <i>Enterprise</i> kept growing as the shuttle flew on towards it, sliding up and to the right as Sulu maneuvered the <i>Copernicus</i> around to fly by the engineering hull. Even as they flew, clamshell doors at the aft of the <i>Enterprise</i> opened up, revealing a shuttle bay.</p><p>Sulu glanced up. “All right, you three. Time to return to your seats and strap in. Safety and regulations first.”</p><p>No one grumbled as they returned to their seats, Twilight using her magic to strap them all in. The shuttle slowed down as it approached the shuttle bay, passing through the magnetic containment field keeping the atmosphere in. Inside, several more shuttles and vehicles could be seen, along with cargo containers, tool racks, and various other devices.</p><p>The shuttle hovered over a circular plate in the deck before dropping and touching down. Sulu unbuckled himself from his chair, stood up, and turned to the ponies. “Ladies, welcome to the <i>Enterprise</i>. Sorry for the lack of a welcoming committee in the shuttle bay itself. Captain Kirk, Mister Scott, and Doctor McCoy are right outside.”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “Safety first, right?”</p><p>Sulu unsealed the shuttle's hatch, leading the three out and onto the deck itself.</p><p>Twilight hesitated for a moment before finally stepping out. She touched the deck plating and sucked in a breath. “I can almost feel the warp engines.” She looked to Cadance and Rainbow Dash as they stepped down. “Can you feel it? The power?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes. “Do you need a moment alone with your coltfriend,” she said, snickering.</p><p>Twilight paid her no mind as she followed Sulu to a door near the aft end of the shuttle bay. They walked through, finding Captain Kirk, Bones, and Scotty on the other side. All three men wore their dress uniforms. Kirk snapped to attention. “Princess Sparkle, Princess... Cadance, Rainbow Dash, welcome to the <i>Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>Twilight looked up at him, grinning. “Thank you Captain! I am <i>so</i> excited to be here. I mean, I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd <i>ever</i> do anything like this!” She tapped the deck with her hooves. “Can you feel it? Can you feel the warp core?”</p><p>Scotty rubbed his chin. “Lassie, I think you and I are going to get along <i>just</i> fine.” He glanced over. “Miss Dash, good to see you again. Especially when I'm not seeing <i>two</i> of you!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash chuckled and patted her chest. “Well, come on, Scotty! Two of me? That's twice the awesome!”</p><p>Twilight floated her suitcase up and over to Kirk. “Captain, here's what you requested. It took a bit of doing, especially avoiding Sunset and Trixie. But I managed to get two copies.”</p><p>Kirk undid the latches and opened the suitcase. He glanced in, nodded, and snapped it shut. “Thank you, Princess. I will return...<i> these</i> to you before you leave the <i>Enterprise</i>.” Kirk then glanced over at Sulu. “Mister Sulu, excellent piloting job.” he reached up and patted him on the arm. “You have a... <i>message</i> from Starbase Yorktown. Afterwards, please go see Mister Spock and resume assistance on his report.”</p><p>Sulu nodded, his smile falling away. “Thank you, sir.” He looked down. “Princesses, Miss Dash.” And with that, he walked off, disappearing into a turbolift.</p><p>Twilight watched as he walked off. “Hope he's all right.” She looked up at Kirk. “What's Mister Spock working on, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk started walking down the corridor, the rest following either by his side, or close behind. “Mister Spock and a select group of crew members are going through the episodes and movies Sunset and Trixie gave us to... <i>formulate</i> a report and appropriate responses to the information. We probably can't act on <i>everything</i>, but there <i>are</i> things under our control, that we can change for the better.” He held his right hand up as he spoke, gesturing.</p><p>Cadance spoke up. “So, what's the first stop on the tour, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk glanced at her as they turned a corner. “First stop is right ahead, Princess.” He walked up to a set of double-doors at the end of the corridor. “Welcome to Main Engineering. Mister Scott?”</p><p>Scotty walked forward, grinning. “Thank you, Captain.” The doors slid open as he approached them. Inside was a cavernous, two-story room. Consoles and banks lined the bulkheads, with ladders and stairwells at regularly-spaced intervals. In the center was a gray, domed pedestal. And near the back, a large, grated barrier <i>dominated </i>the bulkhead. Large yellow pipes big enough for a pony to fly through ran from floor to ceiling, each one pulsing slightly. Engineers were scattered about, doing various tasks or going from one workstation to another.</p><p>Twilight slowly walked forward. Her head darted about. “Oh, wow.” She stopped in front of the pedestal, her wings slowly extending. “Is that what I think it is?”</p><p>Scotty walked over to the pedestal and tapped the dome. “Aye, lassie. This is the top of the matter/antimatter reaction chamber. Below, streams of matter and antimatter hit a specially-shaped dilithium crystal, producing energized plasma.” He turned and pointed to the barrier. “Those conduits send the plasma to the nacelles, enabling us to bend or 'warp' space.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's eyes lost focus slightly. “Yeah, okay...”</p><p>Twilight trotted up to the chamber. Her horn glowed slightly. “There's so much <i>power</i> here, Mister Scott. I can feel it. Oh, to have build something like this!”</p><p>Scotty knelt down. “I have technical manuals, if you'd like to look them over. They're a bit dry, but–”</p><p>The light around Twilight's horn increased. Her head shot up. “Really? Really!” She started hopping up and down, going around in a circle. “Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!”</p><p>Awkward silence descended upon those standing around her. Rainbow Dash and Cadance exchanged a glance. “Okay, you were her foalsitter.” Rainbow Dash swept a wing at the still-hopping Twilight. “How'd you calm her down?”</p><p>Cadance groaned. She walked over and placed herself in Twilight's path. Her horn glowed and Twilight floated up off the ground. “Okay, calm down!” she announced. “Calm down right now or straight to bed when we get back home, young lady. I mean it!”</p><p>Twilight kicked at the air for a few seconds before she ceased, realization setting in. Her cheeks burned crimson, and she hung her head low. “I am... I am sorry, everyone. I have no excuse for my behavior, there.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head and waved her off. “It's... no problem, your highness. I'm rather... <i>glad</i> to see you so enthusiastic about learning.” He looked to Bones. “Isn't that right, Doctor?”</p><p>Bones nodded. “Indeed, Captain. Sound mind in a sound body. I don't see anything wrong with it.”</p><p>Scotty showed the three around, pointing out various consoles, devices, and what they did. The three ponies listened and watched with rapt attention. Near the end, Rainbow Dash finally spoke. “Okay, I'm not exactly the smartest pegasus in Equestria. The coolest, but not the smartest. But even I get just how complex and dangerous this can be if you don't know what you're doing.”</p><p>Scotty nodded to her, his expression serious. “Aye, Rainbow Dash. Thank you for noticing that.” He waved his hand around, motioning to the entirety of Main Engineering. “Every person here is highly-trained in their duties. They have to be. Otherwise... boom!” He threw his hands up into the air, cheeks puffing out at the last word.</p><p>Kirk spoke up. “Indeed, Mister Scott.” He stepped back and lifted his head, even as his voice rose. “Indeed, I'd be willing to call the engineering team of the <i>Enterprise</i> the... <i>finest</i> crew in Starfleet.”</p><p>Scotty beamed. “Thank you, Captain. That means a lot.”</p><p>Kirk motioned to the door leading out. “Well, ladies. Next on the tour, we have our science labs, as well as... sick bay, photon-torpedo control...”</p><p>As they left, Cadance hung back, sidling up to Bones. “Doctor,” she said, keeping her voice low, “would it be possible for you to give me an examination before I leave, please?” She held up a wing. “I'm not sick or carrying any contagious disease. At least... not any I <i>know</i> of.”</p><p>Bones' brow furrowed. “Well... I don't see why not, Princess. Truth be told I <i>do</i> want to do some more research on your anatomy. Although I am wondering what your specific <i>reason</i> for this, is.”</p><p>Cadance blinked. “Well... promise you won't tell anyone?”</p><p>Bones nodded. “Doctor-patient confidentiality, Princess. Unless it's something that threatens the <i>Enterprise</i>, my lips are sealed.”</p><p>Cadance let out a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Doctor McCoy. That means a lot to me.”</p><p>Bones waved her off. “Please, Princess, just call me 'Bones'.”</p><p>Cadance nickered. “Only if you call me 'Cadance', Bones. At least when we're not at a formal function.”</p><p>Bones chuckled. “I think you and I will get along just fine.”</p><hr/><p>The bridge's turbolift doors slid open. Kirk walked out, followed by Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Cadance. “And here we have the bridge,” Kirk said. He waved his hand around, encompassing the entire area. “This is the... <i>command</i> center of the <i>Enterprise</i>. Orders are given, implemented, and carried out from here. You could consider this to be the 'brain' of the <i>Enterprise</i>.”</p><p>Twilight walked along the outer perimeter of the bridge. She stopped in front of the main viewscreen, currently showing Equus from orbit. She stared up at it, mouth hanging open slightly and eyes wide.</p><p>Kirk walked over and stood by Twilight's side. “Puts things in perspective, doesn't it.”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “Commander Sulu was reciting something from a speech called the 'Pale Blue Dot'. I don't think I'll ever get used to seeing my home from this angle or distance.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash trotted over to the stations just forward of the captain's chair. “Pavel, looking a bit more sober than the last time,” she said, winking.</p><p>Chekov glanced up from the helm console. “Yes, but not <i>quite</i> having as good a time as before.” He looked to his left, and the person occupying the navigator's chair. “Ah, Rainbow Dash, I'd like you to meet my friend, Arex.”</p><p>Arex looked over, his bulbous, orange-skinned head turning. He raised the arm extending from his chest and waved it at Rainbow Dash. “Pleasure to meet you, Miss Dash. How do you like the tour so far?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash returned the wave. “It's pretty cool. Say, if you don't mind me asking, what planet are you from?”</p><p>Arex smiled, his yellow eyes shining. “I don't mind at all. I'm from Edos, located in the Triangulum Constellation.” He motioned to the console in front of him with his right hand. “Care to take a look?”</p><p>Rainbow Dash's wings shot straight out. “Do I ever!”</p><p>Cadance, meanwhile, walked up to a seat in the center of the bridge. “I presume this is your chair, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk nodded and walked over to Cadance's side. “Correct, Princess.” He waved his arm around, pointing at each station. “From here, I can receive any and... <i>all</i> pertinent information from the outer duty stations. Engineering, gravity control, communications, weapons, helm and navigation, and science, among others.” He patted the backrest. “It's quite comfortable.”</p><p>Cadance nickered. “It'd have to be.”</p><p>After a few minutes of asking questions and wandering about, the three ponies gathered together at the captain's chair. “Well, what would you like to see next?” Kirk asked.</p><p>Rainbow Dash held a foreleg up and waved it. “Ooh, ooh! I wanna go try one of those shuttle simulators Commander Sulu mentioned!”</p><p>Twilight cleared her throat. “Well, I'd like to go to one of those science labs you mentioned. Imagine what I could learn there!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes. “Bo-ring!”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Well, you don't <i>have</i> to go. Didn't you wanna go play in a shuttle simulator or something?”</p><p>Even as Rainbow Dash opened her mouth, Cadance trotted over and slid into the space between. Her wings spread out, pushing them both back slightly. “Whoa, whoa! Not here, you two!” She looked up at Kirk, grinning nervously. “My apologies, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk chuckled and waved her off. “Thank you, but no need, Princess.” He scratched the back of his neck. “Remind me to tell you about the... <i>Dohlman</i> of Elas sometime.”</p><p>Twilight cleared her throat. “I <i>do</i> still wish to apologize for my outburst there, Captain. It was still unseemly of me.” She leaned forward and looked to Rainbow Dash. “I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.”</p><p>Rainbow Dash nodded. “Same here, Twilight. Sorry.”</p><p>Kirk spoke up. “Well, while Rainbow Dash is using the shuttle simulators, Twilight, you can visit one of the science labs. I'm sure both of you will find them to be quite... <i>enjoyable</i>.”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin. “So... wanna join me in the science lab, Cadance?” She clapped her front hooves together. “I bet we'd have a lot of fun!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash snorted. “Come on, Twilight. We <i>both</i> know she's rather be hanging out with me, dodging meteor showers.”</p><p>Cadance's eyes shifted back and forth between them. “Actually... I've got my own request,” she finally said, her muzzle puckering slightly.</p><hr/><p>Bones sat in his office in sickbay, recorder in one hand and PADD in the other. He swiveled about in his chair. “Medical log; supplemental. I've been going over the scans I've taken of Celestia, Luna, and Twilight Sparkle in anticipation of Princess Cadance showing up.” He held the PADD up, his eyes narrowing as he looked at the screen. “I'm not entirely sure what to expect from her. My gut says it's nothing dangerous. Still, can't be too careful.”</p><p>Just then, Nurse Christine Chapel walked in, Princess Cadance trailing slightly behind. “Doctor, your appointment is here,” Chapel said. She stepped aside. “Now don't worry, dear. His bark is <i>much</i> worse than his bite.”</p><p>Bones rolled his eyes. “Very funny, Christine.” he stood up and motioned to the door. “I believe you have the reports for the upcoming crew physicals to get started on?”</p><p>Chapel nodded to him. “Yes, Doctor. I'll get started on that.” She said her goodbye to Cadance before turning and walking out, leaving the two alone.</p><p>Bones grabbed a medical tricorder from his desk, as well as the PADD, before walking to the door. “Now, if you'll follow me, I have a biobed all set up for us.” He led her out of his office, into the main area of sickbay and over to a bed protruding from the bulkhead. He patted the black cushion. “Now, could you please describe any symptoms you may or may not have? Any problems or things you've noticed?”</p><p>Cadance floated up and onto the biobed. As she did, the body function panel above it activated. “Well, my stomach's been pretty queasy. I've had these odd cravings.” She let out a sigh. “I have a feeling I know what's going on, admittedly. I <i>could</i> have waited until my husband Shining Armor and I got back to the Crystal Empire–more privacy that way–but with the <i>Enterprise</i>, I figured word won't get out.”</p><p>Bones chuckled. “Can't blame you on that.” He paused. “Wait, 'Crystal Empire'?”</p><p>Cadance nodded. “Yes, it's the nation I'm princess of.” She cocked her head to the side. “You didn't know?”</p><p>Bones let out a sigh. “I'm a doctor, Cadance, not an ambassador. Unless necessary, I leave that stuff to Jim and Spock.” He held his tricorder's sensor wand up and waved it over Cadance. He kept his eyes on the tricorder's screen, brow furrowing. “Well, well, well.” He looked up, grinning. “Cadance, I have good news. You are <i>not</i> sick.”</p><p>Cadance let out a breath, her head drooping slightly. “Oh, thank goodness!” Her head then rose. “Wait, I'm not sick. So that means...”</p><p>Bones grinned. “You are pregnant.” He looked up and pointed at the body function panel. “Six weeks, if my readings are accurate, and using the information your government’s already provided us about your basic biology.” He looked back at Cadance and the grin fell away. “Cadance, are you all right?”</p><p>Cadance flapped her wings as she hopped off the bad and back to the deck. Her face paled slightly. “I'm... I'm fine, Bones. Thank you.” Sher cantered from side to side. “Oh...”</p><p>Bones dropped to one knee. “Steady, steady. I can call Twilight and Rainbow Dash here if you'd like.”</p><p>Cadance stopped, turned, and held a hoof up. “No, Doctor. <i>Please</i> don't call them unless necessary. I don't want either of them getting too excited. Especially not Twilight. I'd prefer to tell them when we're back in Equestria and not in a starship in deep space. Twilight can get a little... excitable.”</p><p>Bones grimaced. “Her powers can get out of control?”</p><p>Cadance waved her head back and forth. “She's... she's a <i>lot</i> better than she used to be, Doctor. A <i>lot</i> better. But to be honest? Yes. Sometimes.”</p><p>Bones drew his fingers across his mouth. “My lips are sealed.” He stood up. “I'll be honest, Cadance. I haven't had much time to specifically study alicorn anatomy. I can give you general readings, but overall it'd be better for your own doctors to give you a physical. If you'd like, I can give you a printout of the readings I've taken of you already for them to use.”</p><p>Cadance smiled. “Thank you, Bones.” She looked to the biobed. “Would you like to do a full physical on me? To add to your knowledge of alicorn anatomy?”</p><p>There was a pause before Bones laughed. “Well, there's a first!” At Cadance's expression of confusion, he shrugged. “Most of the time I have to <i>drag</i> people into sickbay for their physical, Cadance.” He patted the biobed once more. “Your throne awaits.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight, Cadance, and Rainbow Dash walked back to the shuttle bay, Kirk and Sulu leading them. Rainbow Dash's wings were extended and waved about as she walked and talked. “So, it turns out flying a shuttle is a <i>lot</i> harder than it looks. Especially when you're trying to dodge rocks flying at you from all directions.”</p><p>Cadance and Twilight exchanged a look. “We figured,” Cadance said, smiling.</p><p>Twilight nodded. “Trying to predict and dodge everything coming from every direction would almost be impossible to calculate.” Her brow furrowed and her horn lit up. “Unless...”</p><p>Cadance placed a hoof on Twilight's shoulder. “Maybe when we get back to Equestria you can figure it out?”</p><p>Twilight's horn dimmed. “I guess.” She glanced at Cadance out of the corner of her eye. “So... how was sickbay? Are you all right?”</p><p>Cadance's head bobbed back and forth. “I am perfectly all right, and I promise to tell you both. But only when we get back to Equestria.” She crossed herself. “Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!” she chanted, ending the ritual by placing a hoof over her closed right eye.</p><p>The group stopped in front of the shuttle bay's main entrance. Kirk turned and stepped over to the ponies. “And this concludes the tour. I hope you three found it... <i>enlightening</i> and educational.” he held up the suitcase Twilight had brought aboard. “Twilight, everything is... <i>all</i> set.”</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed and she gently floated it away from Kirk and to her flank. “Thank you, Captain. You have <i>no</i> idea how much this is gonna mean to Sunset and Trixie.”</p><p>Kirk half-grinned. “I have a bit of an...<i> idea</i>.” He spun about. “Mister Sulu, <i>Copernicus </i>is all set for the flight back home. Safe journey, Commander.”</p><p>Sulu nodded. “Thank you, sir.” He looked to his passengers. “Ready?” he asked, grinning.</p><p>Twilight looked over her shoulder, down the corridor. “As much as I'd <i>love</i> to spend the next decade or so inside that science lab, and explore every nook and cranny of this ship... it's time to go back, Mister Sulu.” She looked to Kirk, smiling slightly. “Until next time, Captain?”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Until next time, Princess.”</p><hr/><p>“You're <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p>Kirk walked down the hallways of the <i>Enterprise</i>, nodding occasionally to crewmembers as they passed him by. His travels took him to the recreation deck, the site of Mister Spock's research into the television shows eerily depicting the <i>Enterprise's </i>five-year mission... and beyond.</p><p>He entered, nodding to Lieutenant Harb Tanzer at one of the tables. Harb, the head of Recreation, snapped to attention. “Captain.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “At ease, Lieutenant.” He looked around. Every table was occupied by a fellow crew member, a three-dimensional image playing out above the table's holo-projector. Each one of them had a PADD and stylus that they scribbled at furiously. “Sorry about the... <i>commotion</i> here, Harb.”</p><p>Harb shook his head. “No need, sir, but thank you.” He looked over his right shoulder. “From what Mister Spock's told me, this is pretty important.”</p><p>In the center of the room sat Spock, <i>three</i> holo-projectors playing out before him. His eyes darted from back and forth, missing nothing. He kept his focus on his work as Kirk walked over. “Captain, I am pleased to report that we have managed to watch approximately seventy-five point eighty-three percent of the episodes and all of the movies Trixie Lulamoon and Sunset Shimmer have given us. I should be able to write a report and begin formulating appropriate countermeasures before the deadline.” He looked down and picked up a PADD. “However, there is one discrepancy I have found from the fifth movie.” He handed the PADD to Kirk. On it was the image of an older Vulcan male with a beard. “One of the main characters is my supposed half-brother, Sybok.”</p><p>Kirk looked at the PADD. “I didn't know you had a half-brother, Spock. I don't <i>quite</i> see the family resemblance.”</p><p>Spock shook his head. “I do not have a half-brother, Captain. Or any other siblings. I am an only child.” He took the PADD back. “Aside from that, though, the movie is accurate. There <i>is</i> a Nimbus III, that the Federation, Klingon Empire, and Romulan Star Empire have agreed to develop together. The ambassadors sent there, as far as I have been able to determine, do exist.” He arched an eyebrow. “I am not entirely sure why I have a half-brother, here, considering how accurate the movies and television episodes have been so far.”</p><p>Kirk shrugged. “Well, can't get it... <i>all</i> right.”</p><p>Before Spock could respond, M'ress walked over, PADD in paw. “Commander, I have finished season seven of Deep Space Nine,” she reported, holding the PADD out.</p><p>Spock reached out and took it, his eyes barely glancing in her direction. “Thank you, Lieutenant. Please assist Mister Sulu in finishing up Voyager.” He set the PADD down on the table, finally taking his eyes off the images and looking directly at Kirk. “Captain, do you require assistance?”</p><p>Kirk chuckled slightly. “I do, Mister Spock. Thank you.” He held his arms out. “That third movie, Search for... <i>Spock. </i>I was wondering if you had a spare copy of it I could watch.”</p><p>Spock quirked an eyebrow up. &quot;Per your orders, I have made several copies of the episodes and movies.” he slid a card into a slot into the table. “Computer, copy file 'Star Trek III: The Search for Spock' onto data card.”</p><p>The computer spoke. <i>“Acknowledged. Copying...”</i> There was a <i>ding</i>. <i>“Movie copied.”</i></p><p>Spock pulled the card out. He stood up, but hesitated before holding it out. “Captain, may I ask the reason for wishing to view this movie?”</p><p>Kirk took the card. He glanced down, jaw working for a moment. “'Know your enemy', Mister Spock. This Kruge, I... <i>need</i> to know what drives him, why he does what he does. Only then can I decide what do do about him.” He almost smiled.</p><p>Spock nodded. “Very well, Captain.” he held the card out for Kirk to take. He started to sit back down, but stopped. “Captain, if there is anything you need, please contact me. It would be... illogical for you not to seek help if needed.”</p><p>Kirk glanced down at the deck and tapped the card against the palm of his hand. “Thank you, Mister Spock. I will... keep that in mind.&quot;</p><hr/><p>It was a long walk back to Kirk's quarters, but he reached it all too quickly. He walked in and made his way to the desk in the corner. After a few minutes, he slid the card into a slot on the desk. A monitor mounted to the desk lit up. Kirk cleared his throat. “Computer... play recording on data card from beginning.”</p><p>The computer beeped. <i>“Acknowledged. Beginning playback.”</i></p><p>The screen lit up. Kirk drummed his fingers on the desk as the movie started. He half-closed his eyes as Spock's death played out before him. “Khan...” They snapped open as a Klingon bird-of-prey decloaked at about the nine-minute mark. He leaned forward. “Hello, Kruge.”</p><p>Kirk sat and watched the entirety of the movie, barely moving, except to look askance when David was killed, and to gasp as the <i>Enterprise</i> self-destructed. He bowed his head as Kruge mourned the death of almost his entire crew. As the credits rolled, he pulled the card from the desk. Kirk cradled it in his hand. “I think I have the most loyal crew in Starfleet,” he finally said, half-smiling.</p><p>The smile fell away. Kirk checked the chronometer. <i>Getting time for me to beam down</i>.He glanced at the card in his hand once more before leaving his quarters, ideas already forming in his mind.</p><hr/><p>Kirk materialized inside the Castle of Friendship's main foyer. He oriented himself, quickly spotting Kang, and Mara already there.</p><p>As Kirk walked over, Kang thumped his chest in greeting. “Greetings, Kirk.” He motioned to Mara, who held up a small plastic card. “This contains all the information on Kruge that I could find. He's currently second officer aboard the <i>Kad'nra.</i>”</p><p>Mara offered the card to Kirk, who slowly took it. “Thank you.” He looked around. “I'm... <i>surprised</i> Twilight isn't here.”</p><p>Mara motioned to the back. “She and Spike are preparing some food for us.” She looked down at Kirk's hand. “Do you have any plans?”</p><p>Kirk slowly held the data card up and looked it over. “At the moment, I have an... idea, Mara.” He looked to Kang. “Do you have any... <i>plans</i> concerning the albino?”</p><p>Kang shook his head. “Between the ongoing mission, research into the television shows Trixie Lulamoon and Sunset Shimmer gave us, and the general operations of the ship, we have not had much time. I have sent a message to Kor and Koloth, but they haven't responded.” He clenched a fist and looked to Mara. “I <i>do</i> know I will not rest until we have tracked him to whatever hole he is hiding in, and kill him!”</p><p>Kirk bowed his head. “You'll need help, correct?” At Kang's nod, he continued. “Well, what about... <i>Kruge</i>?”</p><p>Kang leaned forward. “What about him, Kirk? Do you suggest I... recruit him?”</p><p>Kirk smiled and waved his right hand about. “Exactly, Kang. He was able to... <i>find out</i> about Genesis, get the details about it. He'd be a valuable asset to you in your hunt for the Albino.”</p><p>Mara slowly shook her head. “I cannot believe this, Kirk. He will kill your child!”</p><p>Kirk nodded to her. “He... <i>may</i> kill him, Mara, if the sequence of events remain unaltered. However, the odds of that happening are so low, not even <i>Spock</i> is willing to calculate them. It would be a... <i>waste</i> for me to go after him now, Mara.” His eyes shifted to the left and down. “And to be honest, a small part of me... understood his point of view. Especially concerning Genesis.” He shook his head. “We humans can... <i>admire</i> someone, or empathize with them at least, even if we otherwise find them to be abhorrent.”</p><p>Mara shook her head. “I will never understand you Earthers.”</p><p>Kirk shrugged. “Mara, <i>we</i> don't understand ourselves, sometimes.” He stopped speaking for a moment. “Kruge was acting out of... concern for the Klingon people. Genesis' potential for destruction scares me. How Kruge felt about it...”</p><p>Kang slowly nodded. “You bring up good points, Kirk. I will look into it after this mission is over.” He half-smiled. “You have a knack of making the best of bad situations, Kirk.”</p><p>The doors near the back opened. Twilight and Spike walked out. “Oh, Captain Kirk!” Twilight called out, smiling. “I'm glad to see you.” She waved a wing at the doors. “Spike and I have food ready for you three.” Her eyes darted back and forth. “I think this would qualify as... dinner?”</p><p>Kang barked a laugh. “Food is food, Princess. We shall eat and enjoy your cooking.”</p><p>Twilight shook her head and waved a wing at Spike. “Actually, it’s Spike’s cooking. He’s <i>far</i> better in the kitchen than I’ll ever be.”</p><p>Spike grinned and puffed his chest out slightly. “Well, I try, Twilight. Thanks.” He looked to Kang. “It might be a little blander than I hoped, though. I tried to talk Twilight into trying out a spell so you could eat gems, but she shot it down.” He sighed. “I think you would've liked rubies, too.”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Spike, I <i>really</i> don't think it's a good idea to try experimental spells on foreign dignitaries.”</p><p>Mara walked over to the pair. She pulled out her tricorder and flipped the top flap open. “Spike, may I scan you while you eat? I've heard dragons on this planet have robust digestive systems, but you're the only one I've met face-to-face.”</p><p>Spike looked up at Mara. He puffed his chest out. “Go right ahead, Mara!” he stretched his arms out and flexed his biceps.</p><p>Kang chuckled as he and Kirk walked towards the other three. “Be careful, Spike! I might have to challenge you to a duel.”</p><p>Spike took a step back, hands held out. “Whoa, no need for that, Captain! I've only got eyes for one lady.”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Sure, Spike.” She turned to the door. “If you'll follow me to the dining room?”</p><p>Kang waited for Kirk to walk up to his side before continuing on. His expression darkened with each step. “Mara and Kina have informed me of several... 'incidents' concerning the Empire. Some of them are easy to deal with, such as making sure no one tries to attack V'Ger. Other things...” His head drooped. “If things do not change, Praxis will explode in 2293, due to over-mining. It will <i>devastate </i>Q'onoS.” He glanced at Kirk. “What has Spock told you? From what I know of your first officer, he should be close to finishing all six series by now!”</p><p>Kirk shook his head as they walked through the doors and started down a corridor. “He has a team helping out with it, Kang. I want as detailed a report as possible, and a few exceptions, I don't want it... <i>piecemeal</i>. It could lead to ill-informed decisions down the line.”</p><p>Kang nodded. “A wise decision, Kirk.” They followed the others through a door on the left, into a small dining room. A crystalline table growing out of the floor dominated the room, plates, silverware, bowls, and food laid out on it. Kang walked up to it and tapped it with his hand. “Of course,” he finally said, smiling.</p><p>Twilight's horn glowed. The five chairs arrayed around the table slid out. “We don't have to be too formal, right? Dig in, everyone!” She hopped up and floated onto a chair.</p><p>Spike, Kirk, Kang, and Mara followed suit. Kirk looked up at Kang from across the table. “Kang, do you feel... <i>comfortable</i> talking about this with Twilight and Spike here?”</p><p>Kang looked to the princess, then to her dragon friend. “I trust them, Kirk.”</p><p>Twilight waved a foreleg in the air. “I won't repeat anything heard here, Captains. Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my–ouch!” she cried out as her hoof touched her opened eye.</p><p>Mara stood up. “Princess, are you all right?”</p><p>Spike, sitting between Mara and Twilight, held his hand up and waved Mara off. “No need to worry, Mara. Twilight's done that so often I think her eye's gotten a callous over it, or something.”</p><p>Twilight's open eye narrowed. “Oh, <i>very</i> funny, Spike.”</p><p>Kang stared at her for a moment before turning to face Kirk. “As I said, Praxis will explode. And thanks to the Empire trying to keep up with Starfleet, we will...” He clenched his fist and <i>smacked</i> it into the table, sending out a small spiderweb of cracks from the impact. “We will be unable to do anything about it.”</p><p>Twilight's ears folded flat against her skull. “That sounds... horrific, Captain!” She thumped her chest with a hoof. “Well, Equestria will help you out, no matter what!”</p><p>Kang sighed. “You might, Princess. The Federation will.” He looked up at Kirk and half-smiled. “You look exactly as I did when I first heard the news, Kirk. Yes, after decades of hostility, the Federation will help the Klingon Empire save itself from its own shortsightedness. It won't be easy... but it <i>does</i> happen.”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “Well, as one of my heroes once said, 'Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends'?”</p><p>Spike barked a laugh. “That might as well be Twilight's motto, Captain!”</p><p>Kirk looked to Spike. “Somehow, I'm not... <i>surprised</i>, Spike.”</p><p>Twilight's head bobbed down. “I've found it to be much more preferable to the alternative.”</p><p>Kang half-smiled. “It would depend on the enemy, Twilight. Still, I cannot deny that it has provided benefits for my crew and I. And it will save the Empire. The question is, though, what do I do with this information? If anything?”</p><p>Spike tilted his head to the side. “Wait, what? Okay, I know I'm a young dragon, but isn't a moon exploding and damaging your home planet bad?”</p><p>Kang nodded to him. “It is, but there is... much good to come from it, Spike. Without it, I cannot see how the Empire will accept help from the Federation.” He shook his head. “We are a <i>proud</i> people, sometimes too proud for our own good. I do not see a way for the Empire to cease hostilities unless there is no other choice.”</p><p>“Such as the one Praxis provides,” Twilight said, ears folding down against her skull.</p><p>Kang seemed to shrink in on himself. “Such as the one Praxis provides,” he repeated. He suddenly shot up out of his chair, his face twisting with rage. “And that's not the end of it! The Romulans, our supposed 'allies', will stab us in the back, attacking us at Khitomer and Narendra III. And do you know who will aid us? Do you know who will help us?”</p><p>Twilight stared up at him, eyes slightly wide. “The... Federation?”</p><p>Kang looked to Kirk, still sitting. “Perhaps your people are more honorable than I thought. And perhaps... we are not so honorable as <i>I</i> believed us to be.”</p><p>Kirk arched an eyebrow. He held up his right hand. “Kang, if you don't... <i>wish</i> talk about anything, there's no pressing need to. I'll be receiving my... <i>own</i> report about upcoming events from Mister Spock.”</p><p>Kang shook his head. “You have not held any secrets from me. It would be... dishonorable to hold anything back from you, Kirk.” He rapped the knuckles of his right hand against the table. “Political expediency will have replaced honor in the High Council. The House of Duras... are traitors to the Empire, collaborators with the Romulans. And their actions will cost us dearly.”</p><p>Mara spoke up, her expression dark. “They will plunge us into civil war, and nearly destroy the Empire. “ She leaned forward. “Do you know what the worst part is?” She abruptly <i>slammed</i> a fist into the table, causing both Twilight and Spike to jump in their seats. “The High Council will attempt to... cover up their crimes, and frame someone else!”</p><p>Kang snarled. “Their actions will bring shame and dishonor upon us all!” He shook his head. “And yes, as Mara said, it will lead to civil war. At the very least their actions will be brought to light. But that it will go that far at all?” His expression fell, his eyes turning hollow for a moment. “To fall that far. And I do not know if there is anything I can do to stop it.”</p><p>Spike scratched the side of his head. “But, you know all that's gonna happen, right? Isn't there anything you can do? At all?”</p><p>Kang glanced at the young dragon. “There's too much unknown, Spike. The television series are Federation-centered, which makes sense upon reflection. There are large gaps, and worse, the rot is deeply ingrained.” He shook his head. “I once met an old man, a magistrate named Kolos. He warned me that honor was becoming meaningless in the Empire. I should have heeded his words then.”</p><p>Kirk finally stood up. He walked around the table, right up to Kang. “So what will you... <i>do</i>, Kang? Nothing?” he crossed his arms and canted his jaw. “That... doesn't sound like the Kang I know.”</p><p>Kang met Kirk's eyes. He crossed his own arms and leaned back slightly. “There might <i>be</i> nothing that I can do, Kirk! The House of Duras is very powerful.” He ran his thumbnail over his forehead. “And the House of Kang is... not.”</p><p>Kirk kept his gaze steady, his eyes locked onto Kang's. “I did not think Kang, Son of K'naiah, would back down from a fight to restore... <i>honor</i> to the Empire he fights for.” He arched an eyebrow. “Are you... scared?”</p><p>The temperature in the room seemed to drop by several dozen degrees. Kang growled low in his throat. “You would do well not to travel in that direction, Kirk. My respect for you only goes so far in holding me back!”</p><p>Kirk leaned forward. “If you're willing to... <i>kill</i> me for an imagined slight, why aren't you willing to... fight for the Empire? Or at least to <i>try</i>?”</p><p>Twilight's horn flared. She disappeared, reappearing between the two. She spread her wings out, forcing the two back. “Hey, hey!” Her head whipped back and forth. “I do <i>not</i> need you two bickering like this, or tossing thinly-veiled threats back and forth like a couple of foals!” She fully turned to face Kirk. “Captain Kirk, I know you have Kang's best interests at heart, but goading him like that is probably <i>not</i> going to have the intended effect.”</p><p>Kang smirked, but it fell away as Twilight turned to him. “And Captain Kang, Kirk may have gone about it the wrong way, but like I said, he <i>does </i>have your best interest at heart.” She tilted her head in Kirk's direction. “Even if he's probably not aware of the entire situation.”</p><p>Kirk let out a small sigh. “That is... <i>true</i>, Princess.” He spread his arms out. “You may not believe it, Kang, but I don't want the Klingon Empire to fall.”</p><p>Kang stared at him. “I... believe you, Kirk.” He looked to the table and turned to it. “I shall try to explain things to you, as best I can. And maybe you can see the true difficulties that lie ahead for my people.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight and Spike watched as Kirk, Kang, and Mara were beamed away to their ships. “Okay, that went... interestingly,” Twilight said. She rubbed her forehead with a wing. “It was quite educational, too. I didn't know some Klingons had ridges, for instance.”</p><p>Spike nodded. “Yeah, so two questions, then.”</p><p>Twilight glanced to him. “Oh?”</p><p>Spike paused, then held out his hand and started ticking off claws. “Well, maybe more than two. Anyway. First off, what's your plan to get these two working together?”</p><p>Twilight's horn flashed. A scroll, quill, and inkwell flashed into existence, the three objects floating in front of her muzzle. “Well, first off, learn Klingonese. The Trixie from Canterlot High is apparently <i>fluent</i> in it! Then, read everything I can get my hooves on concerning their government, their culture, and anything else I can think of. I <i>have</i> to fill in the gaps between the episodes.” She gasped, then scribbled on the scroll. “I'd better watch the episodes, too!”</p><p>Spike slowly nodded. “Okay, next?”</p><p>Twilight's eyes looked down. “Next, construct a detailed, multi-branched plan using said information that will should aid Kang in whatever changes he may wish to make.”</p><p>Spike rolled his eyes. “Ah, Twilight? Do you <i>really</i> think you'll be able to do all of that before Kang leaves?” He held up a hand and place it over Twilight's muzzle. “<i>And</i> tend to all your duties, obligations, and a normal sleep schedule that I, Cadance, and possibly others <i>will</i> make sure you keep?”</p><p>Twilight wiggled her head back and forth. “Well... I can send the plan to him over subspace, maybe? Or invite him back at a later date? I've got to do <i>something</i>, Spike.”</p><p>Spike nodded and patted her on the shoulder. “I know, Twilight. You wouldn't be <i>you</i> if you didn't. Just make sure it's the <i>right</i> thing to do<i>.</i>”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “You're right, Spike. I can't rush this. There's too much at stake to go half-flanked with any plans I can make.”</p><p>Spike smiled and sighed in relief. “Well, thank Celestia for that. Now the next question?” At Twilight's nod, he continued. “Who are you, and what have you done with the real Twilight Sparkle?”</p><p>Silence descended upon the room. Twilight's eyes narrowed. She lowered her head and stepped forward, her face an inch or two from Spike's. “I'm sorry, could you... explain that last question?” she asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>Spike returned her own narrowed glare. He crossed his arms as he spoke. “You just learned last night that Cadance and Shining Armor are going to have a baby. Not <i>once</i> did you lose control while talking to Captains Kirk or Kang, or Mara. You didn't even <i>mention</i> it to them!”</p><p>Twilight swallowed. She glanced away from Spike, her cheeks coloring slightly. “Okay... good point.” She shrugged. “Believe me, Spike. I would've loved nothing more than to hop up and down in a circle while telling them <i>all</i> about my new niece or nephew. But if I did that...”</p><p>“Neither one of them would've taken you seriously again?” Spike finished.</p><p>Twilight's head ducked low, her cheeks turning even redder. “Exactly. It was one thing to do that in the engine room of the <i>Enterprise</i>, another thing to do that here in a meeting between the two captains.” The corners of her mouth turned up slightly. “And I think I got <i>enough</i> of it out last night.”</p><p>Spike's eyes widened. He stared off into space, mouth open slightly as memories assailed him.</p><hr/><p><i>Twilight bounced up and down, circling Shining Armor and Cadance. Spike floated behind her, Twilight's magic wrapped around him. He tossed and turned with each bounce. “Yes yes yes yes yesyes yes!” Twilight chanted, grinning wildly. She stopped in front of Cadance and Shining Armor. “I'm gonna be the greatest aunt in Equestria! No, the galaxy!” She started hopping around again, Spike trailing behind.</i></p><hr/><p>Spike blinked and shook his head. “Yeah, you sure did,” he mumbled under his breath. He cleared his throat before continuing. “So, will you <i>promise me</i> that if I say for you to slow down or take a break, you will?”</p><p>Twilight nodded, straightening up. “Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye,” she chanted, making the motions of the Pinkie Promise and remembering to close her eye this time. She paused for a few moments before speaking once more. “So... would it be all right for me to start working <i>now</i>?”</p><p>Spike rubbed his chin. “Well... okay, Twilight. We can start, but you <i>will</i> break for dinner later on.”</p><p>Twilight grinned. She turned, but stopped and glanced over her shoulder at Spike. “Wait, 'we'? Didn't you have plans or something?”</p><p>Spike shrugged. “Eh, I can reschedule. The Number-One Princess needs her Number-One Assistant!”</p><p>Twilight grinned. Her horn glowed as she gently lifted Spike up and onto her back. “She does indeed, Spike. Thanks.” She reared back and kicked her legs in the air. “To the library!” Her horn flared once more as she and Spike teleported out of the kitchen, vanishing in a flash of light.</p>

<p>Sunset and Trixie stood on the front lawn of Canterlot High, facing the statue that served to cover the gateway to Equestria. Trixie carried a suitcase with her DVD collection in it, while Sunset had her laptop. School had gotten out an hour ago, and except for them, the area was deserted. Trixie looked to Sunset, eyebrow arched. “Twilight <i>really</i> said this was a matter of interstellar importance?”</p><p>Sunset looked to Trixie, but rolled her eyes. “I'm sure, and stop doing the Vulcan eyebrow!” She waggled a finger at Trixie. “And no saying something is 'fascinating' or how you're a doctor, not... something else.”</p><p>Trixie held up a hand. “All right, sorry. I'll keep it to a minimum.” She waited a handful of heartbeats before continuing. “Besides, I'd say I'm a magician, not something else.”</p><p>Any retort was cut off as Twilight emerged from the portal. She barely broke stride as she looked to Trixie and Sunset. “Oh, I'm so glad you're both here!” she said, smiling.</p><p>Trixie thumped her chest. “But of course, Twilight! Whatever you need help with, Trixie and Sunset shall do our best!” She paused. “So, what <i>is</i> it you need from us?”</p><p>Twilight swallowed. “Trixie, I need you to help me to learn how to read, write, and speak Klingonese.” She looked to Sunset. “And from the both of you, I need as much information as you can give me about Klingon culture, politics, and history. The fate of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants may depend on this!”</p><p>Trixie slowly blinked. She looked to Sunset, then back to Twilight, then to Sunset again. “May I arch my eyebrow, now?”</p><p>Sunset nodded. “Go right ahead, Trixie. I'll be arching my eyebrow right alongside you.” She deliberately turned to Twilight, leaned in, and arched her right eyebrow high. “Could you please start over at the beginning?”</p><p>Trixie looked down at her suitcase. “This actually makes sense.” She looked up at Twilight. “Why us? And why do you want this information?”</p><p>Twilight looked back to the statue and waved a hand at it. “The crews of both ships have been going through the television episodes and movies you let them copy. Spike and I had lunch with Captains Kirk, Kang, and Mara this afternoon. And Kang was... pretty darned pessimistic about his chances to affect any positive change to the Empire.” She looked back to the two. “I want to try and help him as much as I can, to form some sort of plan, but my knowledge about the Klingons is... limited at best.”</p><p>Sunset slowly nodded. “And you want Trixie and I to, what, <i>teach you</i> about the Klingons?” She scratched her head. “Wouldn't it be better for you to ask Kang directly? Or, I don't know, ask for some sort of information-exchange with them?”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. “I've asked Kang and his senior staff a <i>lot</i> of questions, and they've answered as well as they could. But I don't know how long they'll remain. And once the <i>K'naiah's Pride</i> leaves orbit, I'm not sure I'll have a reliable means to communicate with Kang.”</p><p>Trixie nodded and rubbed her chin. “That's very... logical, Twilight. Meanwhile, Trixie and Sunset shall be here to aid and advise you whenever you need!” She suddenly thumped her chest, then thrust her fist out in a Klingon salute. “SoH vaj boQ jIH neH Qu', choS Sparkle!”</p><p>Twilight slowly returned the salute, her right eye twitching slightly. “Thank you... I think?”</p><p>Trixie chuckled. “That means yes, Twilight. I'll help in any way I can.”</p><p>Sunset reached out and squeezed Twilight's right shoulder. “So will I, Twilight.”</p><p>Twilight looked to her. She covered Sunset's with her own hand, beaming. “Thank you.” She looked to Trixie. “And thank <i>you</i>.” She let out a breath. “I should warn you both. This isn't gonna be a short project. Spike's already told me he's gonna make sure I don't stay up for a week straight and give Kang a half-flanked plan that would cause more harm than anything. I can't plan for everything, but I <i>have to</i> make sure what I present to him is as comprehensive and thought-out as possible.”</p><p>Trixie stepped back. She slid her feet out and jabbed a finger at Twilight. “Never fear, Twilight! No matter what, Trixie will help you steer the course and teach you Klingon language and customs! You shall know the Way of the Warrior! This, Trixie, daughter of Jack Pot, swears!”</p><p>Twilight and Sunset stared at Trixie, silence descending upon the three. Sunset finally clapped her hands together. “Okay! Twilight, do you have a timetable worked out? A schedule?”</p><p>Twilight rubbed her chin and started pacing back and forth. “I want to get started as soon as possible, but I <i>also</i> don't want to interfere with either of your schoolwork.”</p><p>Sunset waved her off. “I think this is important enough that we can both work around things or cut back on other activities.” She looked to Trixie, eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Trixie planted her hands on her hips and leaned towards Sunset. “Do you <i>honestly</i> think I'm not going to put my all into this?”</p><p>Sunset held her hands up in surrender. “Okay, sorry! I should've realized after your little... declaration how seriously you're taking this.” She looked to Twilight, still pacing a bit. “When do you think you'll know more about what you need from us?”</p><p>Twilight stopped pacing, her back to Trixie and Sunset. “I think I'll need a list of episodes that focus on the Klingons themselves. No need to–”</p><p>Trixie stepped up to Twilight. She grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her around to face her. “Do not turn your back to me, and do not speak softly! Do I insult you?” She jabbed a finger at Twilight. “Address me directly, Twilight Sparkle! Give me some respect!”</p><p>Twilight's jaw dropped. She shook her head. “Whoa, whoa! I didn't mean to insult you, Trixie. I'm sorry.” She turned her head to look at Sunset, but Trixie's face filled her sight once more. “Hey!”</p><p>Trixie grinned. “That was your first lesson on Klingon culture, Twilight. You have to be direct with them. No hiding or being shy. They'll see you being weak <i>and</i> insulting them.” She pointed two fingers at her eyes, then turned them so they were pointing at Twilight's. “Make eye contact. Stand up to them in order to gain their respect.”</p><p>Twilight locked eyes with Trixie. She nodded curtly. “I thank you for this!” she half-shouted. She straightened herself up. “I shall comport myself and not hide!”</p><p>Trixie grinned. “Excellent, Twilight. One thing, though.&quot; She held out her right hand, clenched in a fist. “Don't backhand anyone. It's an invitation to a duel to the death. Just use a straight punch.” She paused, eyes losing focus for a moment. “Or back-hoof?”</p><p>Sunset walked up to the two. “I think that's enough for now.” She pointed up at the sun, already close to the horizon. “It's getting a bit late, and I <i>do</i> have some homework to finish up.”</p><p>Twilight nodded in Sunset's direction. “Oh, absolutely! This was more to find out if you were willing to help. And I <i>am</i> very grateful to the both of you for agreeing to this.” She shook Trixie's hand and gave Sunset a hug. “Thank you so much.” She broke the hug and stepped back. “Oh, before I forget. Would you two be available to cross over to Equestria, say... the day after tomorrow? There's something I've got to show you. It's a bit of a... surprise.” Her eyes shifted from left to right, and her mouth puckered slightly.</p><p>Trixie and Sunset exchanged a look. Trixie looked at Twilight. “You <i>do</i> realize it would take the world ending for me to miss out on going over there, right?”</p><p>Sunset snorted. “What she said.” Her expression fell slightly. “I <i>still</i> haven't seen my family in Equestria. Too much stuff happened the other times and...” Her voice trailed off. She looked down at the sidewalk, hands balling into fists.</p><p>Trixie placed a hand on Sunset's shoulder. “Sunset, Twilight and Trixie will <i>make sure</i> you go there this time, Sunset.”</p><p>Twilight placed her hand on Sunset's other shoulder. “Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!” she chanted.</p><p>Trixie's right eyebrow arched. “That sounds like it could get messy.”</p><p>Twilight gasped. “That's what Commander Sulu said!”</p><p>Sunset barked a laugh. “Oh, my!”</p><p>Trixie turned to her. “You know Sulu never said that, right? It was just his actor and it kind of got attached to the character?”</p><p>Sunset crossed her arms in front of her chest and rolled her eyes. “Gee, I never would've figured it out,” she deadpanned.</p><p>Twilight giggled slightly at the two. “You know, it really <i>is</i> good to see you two getting along like this.” She looked back to the statue. “I've got to go, got a lot of planning to do. Although I <i>think</i> I'm starting to figure out the first step in it.” She held up a hand, even as Trixie and Sunset opened their mouths. “Next time, though?” She hugged Sunset once more, then Trixie, before turning and walking up to the statue. She walked right through the concrete pedestal, never slowing down as she passed through the portal and back to Equestria.</p><p>Trixie looked down at the suitcase in her hands. “I never even got to use these,” she said, sighing.</p><p>Sunset chuckled, hefting her laptop. “In the same boat, Trixie.” She patted Trixie on the shoulder. “So homework, then planning session to figure out the most useful episodes? I think we can have one ready by the time we go back to Equestria.”</p><p>Trixie stood up straight, her shoulders square. She looked to Sunset. “Are ye daft, lassie? It'll take four weeks just to figure out what we need!”</p><p>Sunset nodded. “Okay, so we'll have it ready by then?”</p><p>Trixie grinned. “Is there any doubt?” The grin fell away almost as quickly as it was formed. “Actually, no. Trixie isn't Scotty. We'd better get on this.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight stepped through into Equestria, an alicorn once more. She flexed her wings and stamped her hooves. “As much as I like hands,” her horn glowed and a cup of tea materialized in front of her, “not much beats a good old horn,” she finished, taking a sip. She looked over at Spike, standing near the portal, then up a clock on the wall. “Spike, we've got about an hour before dinner. Feel up to some research and cataloging?”</p><p>Spike rubbed his chin. “I think so, provided you stop for dinner. Cadance and Shining Armor are gonna be there, remember?” He waggled a claw at her. “And don't even <i>think</i> about skipping it or working through it.”</p><p>Twilight held up a wing. “Don't worry, Spike. I remember our agreement on this. I won't overdo things or try to rush anything through. When it's time, I'll stop.”</p><p>Spike waggled his head back and forth. “All right, then. So what are we researching?”</p><p>Several books floated off the shelves, along with a scroll, inkwell, and quills. The books all spun around the two before landing in a pyramid next to Twilight. The one on top floated up and off the apex, traveling down and opening up before her. “I want to get a list of the rock farms in Equestria and where they are. I also need to start researching contract law.” She looked up from the book and locked eyes with Spike. “The House of Kang needs something to raise its fortunes, some sort of major victory in order to gain influence. And I think getting a contract for dilithium mining in Equestria would be one <i>hay</i> of a victory for him.”</p>

<p>Discord floated about his house, teacup clasped in his lion's paw of a right hand. He sipped the cup, leaving behind the tea to float about. He grabbed a newspaper as it passed by, unfurling it. The headline changed, updating itself. He adjusted a pair of glasses that popped into existence on the end of his nose. “Hmm, looks like those girls from across the mirror are stirring up a bit of chaos. I always <i>knew</i> that Sunset Shimmer had it in her!”</p><p>A sudden <i>knocking</i> at the front door interrupted his reading. He looked over, scowling. “What the? The door's supposed to quack when someone strikes it, not 'thud'! Thud is so boring!” he teleported himself over. Confetti blasted about and horns sounded as he swung it open. “Yes?”</p><p>Ditzy Doo floated in front of him, wearing the blue uniform of the Equestrian Postal Service. One eye was fixed on him, the other drifting about. “Letter for Mister Discord!” she chirped out, grinning. “Are you Mister Discord?”</p><p>Discord glanced to the side. “You've gotta be kidding me.” He looked back to Ditzy. “I am... Mister Discord.”</p><p>Both of Ditzy's eyes locked onto Discord, startling him. “Yay! I have a letter for you, sir.” She pulled a clipboard out of her left saddlebag with her wing and held it out in front of her. “Sign here, please.”</p><p>Discord reached behind his back, pulled out a small sticker with a draconequus emblazoned on it, and stuck it to the piece of paper on the clipboard.</p><p>Ditzy took the clipboard back, then pulled out an envelope. “Here you go!” she said, grinning. She then turned and flew off into the void surrounding Discord's house.</p><p>Discord stared at her as she flew off. He blinked-and she disappeared. He slowly looked down at the envelope in his hands. It was white, with his name and a series of numbers and letters written out on the front. “Hmm, they got the dimensional coordinates right. Even proper postage!”</p><p>He held the envelope up and floated it a few feet from him. It spun about as Discord's right eye popped out of its socket, grew wings, and flew up to it. A wide beam of light shot from the iris, engulfing the envelope. The eye flew back and lodged itself back into Discord's head. “Nothing?” he growled out. “What do I pay you for?” he shouted, banging his eagle's claw against the side of his head. “What do you mean you don't get a check? It's in the mail!”</p><p>The envelope floated back to him. Discord looked it over one final time before grabbing it. He held it out as far as he could before slicing the top open with a single swipe from a claw. He winced for a moment, but relaxed as nothing happened. “Oh, of course.” He let out a breath. “Discord, old boy, you're getting positively <i>paranoid</i> in your old age.”</p><p>He pulled a letter out of the envelope and held it close. A monocle appeared over his left eye as he cleared his throat and began reading. “'Dear Discord, your presence is requested and required at–”</p><p>The words on the letters brightened. Their glow rapidly increased, turning bright-white. Discord barely had time to register anything before the light engulfed him...</p><hr/><p><i>Discord tossed the letter down. It fluttered, landing not on the floor of his house, but on brown deck plating. His head shot up as he looked around. “What the Tirek?” he exclaimed. He was now in a large room with a high-vaulted ceiling. The walls were sharp, angular, and brown. He clenched his paws into fists. “When I find out who's done this, they're in for a </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">galaxy</span><i> of hurt!” He snapped his fingers... and nothing happened.</i></p><p><i>Discord floated there for a few moments. He looked to his lion's paw and shook it a few times. “Come on, come on!” He snapped his fingers a few more times, but still nothing happened. “Oh, this is just </i>great<i>.”</i></p><p><i>For the first time, Discord </i>really <i>looked around the room he was in. The entire area was bathed in a bright light, washing out details and making things fuzzy. A long table with ten empty chairs dominated the room, all but the one at the head of the table turned to face it. He floated over to a wall, stroking his beard and thankful he could still at least float. “Hmm, seems to be... Cardassian architecture if I'm not mistaken.”</i></p><p>“<i>The Discord has arrived.”</i></p><p><i>Discord whirled around. The eight chairs along the long ends of the table were now occupied. Four of them were humanoid, of various species. The other four took the forms of Celestia, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie. One of the humanoids spoke again, the same one as before. “The game has changed,” she said.</i></p><p><i>Discord looked her over. At first glance she might be mistaken for human, but the ridges along her nose, earring on her right ear, and distinctively-shaped pin over her right breast quickly marked her as Bajoran. Discord's bushy eyebrows furrowed. “Game? What game? Who are you? </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">What </span><i>are you?”</i></p><p><i>A deep voice caught his attention. “Sorry about this. It's always little confusing at first to be in the Celestial Temple, even for a being of chaos such as yourself.”</i></p><p><i>Discord slowly looked up as the chair at the end of the table rotated, showing the occupant. He had dark skin, a neatly-trimmed goatee and mustache, a bald head, and piercing eyes. He wore a Starfleet uniform, albeit one that wouldn't be designed for a little over a hundred years from now. He held a baseball in his right hand, clenching it tightly.</i></p><p><i>After a few seconds, Discord finally gasped. “Celestial Temple, of course!” He motioned to the ones sitting along the table. “That makes you all Prophets...” He jabbed a finger at the man. “And you must be Captain Benjamin Lafayette Sisko, formerly of Starfleet, and currently the Emissary of the Prophets.”</i></p><p><i>Sisko grinned, flashing a toothy smile. “I see my reputation precedes me.”</i></p><p><i>Discord shrugged. “Q told me a bit about what's coming up over the past few days. We've spent a bit of time catching up.” He clenched his eagle's claw into a fist and punched the air. “I especially like the time he showed up on Deep Space Nine and you socked him one.” His grin fell away. “Wait... you're not here to sock </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">me </span><i>one, are you?” He held up both hands in front of him, palms out. “I know I've been pretty bad before, but I'm trying to get better!”</i></p><p><i>Sisko chuckled and waved Discord off. “No need to worry, Discord. We brought you here to ask a favor from you.”</i></p><p><i>The Celestia-Prophet spoke up. “The Sisko must still be born. The Book of the Kosst Amojan must be destroyed and the Pah-Wraiths sealed within the Fire Caves. The lineup has been altered. The path may be changed.”</i></p><p><i>Discord slowly nodded. “And you don't want the Pah-Wraiths getting out any more than I do. Or anyone who's not completely insane, for that matter.” He looked at everyone seated. “So what would you like me to do, precisely?”</i></p><p>“<i>The Discord can see the path better than we can,” another humanoid-Prophet said, this one a Klingon male in a Starfleet uniform. “He can chart the pitches, the outs.”</i></p><p><i>Discord's bushy brow furrowed. “And you can't? You're the Prophets of Bajor! You exist outside of linear time, right? Can't you look forward or something?” He looked down the table at Sisko. “Well?”</i></p><p><i>Sisko bounced his baseball on the table. “Time can still get pretty... jumbled for them, Discord. They needed me to </i>explain<i> the concept of linear time to them to begin with. You're a lot more experienced with this kind of thing.” He tossed the baseball at Discord.</i></p><p><i>Discord held out his lion's paw,... and caught a small globe. He looked it over, quickly recognizing it as Equus. He shrugged, then tossed it back to Sisko, who caught his baseball. “Fine, but you owe me one, Benny.” He looked to the Prophets. “I'll also need access to some of my power, if you don't mind.”</i></p><p><i>The Prophets all looked at each other. The Celestia-Prophet looked to Discord and nodded. “It is done.”</i></p><p><i>Discord grinned. He cracked his knuckles. “All right, folks. Stand back!” A flash of light enveloped him. When it faded, he now wore a white button-up shirt, a brown vest, black slacks, and a cap with a translucent-green visor on it. An old-style stock-ticker machine was next to him, a paper strip stocking out of it. He grabbed the strip and held it up. “All right, let's see here. Might wanna buy stock in rock farms, first off. Second off...” He looked up. “Actually, now that I think about it, what happens if the timeline's changed a bit too much for your liking?”</i></p><p><i>The Pinkie Pie-Prophet spoke. “We shall deal with the changes to the playbook, and set the game back on its course.”</i></p><p><i>Discord looked to her. “Wow. You </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">really </span><i>hammered in the whole 'baseball' thing, didn't you.” He sighed and waved his eagle's claw around. “Let's not beat around the bush, here. What </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">will </span><i>you do to Sunset or Trixie?”</i></p><p><i>Sisko shrugged. “We'll take action when and if necessary, Discord. The Pah-Wraiths </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">must </span><i>remain sealed within the Fire Caves.”</i></p><p><i>Discord let the paper strip slide out of his grasp as he stared across the table at Sisko. “Gee, doesn't that sound ominous. I'd ask a certain Romulan senator what sort of action you'd take, but then I'd have to go forward one hundred-five years and sweep half a sector for Vreenak's subatomic particles.”</i></p><p><i>Sisko slowly rose from his chair and walked slowly towards Discord. “I'm not going to make any apologies for what happened, there. I'd do it again if I had to. In this case, however?” He stopped right next to Discord, his gaze penetrating. “I won't murder two teenagers for trying to help in any way they can. You have my word as a Starfleet officer and the Emissary of the Prophets on </i>that<i>.”</i></p><p><i>Discord returned the gaze. “All right, then.” He picked the paper back up and held it out. “Well, you needn't concern yourself. Turns out you'll still be born, the Book of the Kosst Amojan will still be destroyed, and those nasty brutes will remain locked up, sans air-conditioning, for a long time.” He held the paper strip out to Sisko. “All there in black-and-white.”</i></p><p><i>Sisko took the paper strip and looked it over. “Thank you, Discord.” He turned and walked back to his seat. “We owe you for this.”</i></p><p><i>Discord rolled his eyes. “Don't rush to Equestria to pay me back.” He groaned. “So, are you done with me? I've got an appointment to get to back at Equestria!”</i></p><p><i>The Celestia-Prophet raised a foreleg. “There is one more question.” She waited a moment. “Will the Sisko still punch Q out?”</i></p><p><i>Those seated at the table turned to her. Discord stared at her, eyes wide. The stock-ticker clicked, and another strip of paper emerged from it. He reached down, picked it up, and held it out. “Yes,” he finally said.</i></p><p><i>A smile grew on her face. “Excellent,” she finally said.</i></p><p><i>Discord's jaw dropped. He jabbed a claw at her. “Wait a minute! You're not a Prophet! You're–” He suddenly vanished.</i></p><p><i>Seven of the Prophets rose from the table and walked out of the room. Sisko stared at the one still sitting there. “You know he's going to give you merry hell when you get back,” he said, grinning.</i></p><p><i>Celestia looked to him. “Yes, but it was </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">still </span><i>worth it, Ben.” She leaned towards him. “Any chance we can catch a ball game before I have to go back to Canterlot? Maybe a Red Sox game from the 2004 World Series?”</i></p><p><i>Sisko grinned. “Game four, October 27</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>, 2004 in Busch Memorial Stadium. Why not?” He started to stand up, but stopped. “No drinking contests after, though. The sun still has to rise over Equestria.”</i></p><p><i>Celestia groaned and rolled her eyes. “Oh, all right!” She hopped out of the chair. “Spoilsport,” she said, sticking her tongue out at him.</i></p><p><i>Sisko shook his head. “Just for that, I might have you pay for your own beer and pretzels.” He rubbed his chin. “Want to invite Luna or Cadance?”</i></p><p><i>Celestia reached out with a wing and gently patted Sisko on the shoulder. “Only if Kasidy and Jake can come, too.”</i></p><p><i>Sisko barked a laugh. He grabbed his baseball from the table and tossed it into the air. “We'd better hurry to make the opening pitch, then.”</i></p><p><i>Celestia's horn flashed, enveloping them both in a ball of light. When it faded, both were gone.</i></p><hr/><p>Kang strode onto the bridge of the <i>Pride</i>, looking around and nodding in satisfaction at his crew working efficiently. He spotted Kinna, standing near the captain's chair, and made his way over to his first officer. “Report, Kinna.”</p><p>Kinna straightened and saluted Kang. “All ship's functions are nominal.” He held up a datapad and handed it over to Kang. “There is a message that just came in from General Gor'chuk of the High Command.”</p><p>Kang looked up from the datapad. “How long ago?”</p><p>Kinna glanced to his right, at the communications officer at an aft station. “About five seconds before you entered the bridge, Captain. It's a recording, not real-time.”</p><p>A small growl rumbled from Kang's throat. He leaned over his chair, flipped a switch, and spoke into a small grille mounted on the armrest. “Mara, I need you in Conference Room Two in ten minutes.” He looked up at Kinna. “Commander, I will need you there as well.” He glanced to the navigation stations. “Lieutenant Tarqus, you have the conn.”</p><p>Tarqus shot to her feet. “Yes, sir!” she said, saluting. She walked over to the captain's chair and snapped to attention.</p><p>Kang and Kinna exchanged a look before turning and walking to the aft turbolift, leaving Tarqus in charge while they went to listen to the message.</p><hr/><p>Kang and Kinna walked into Conference Room Two, finding Mara already there and sitting at the table that dominated the room. She rose as the two entered. “Orders from the Empire?” she asked.</p><p>Kang looked to her. “We shall find out momentarily, my wife.” He walked around the table and over to a large, wall-mounted monitor. He flipped a switch on a control panel next to the monitor. “Communications, send message to this conference room. Voice authorization: Kang Alpha-42.”</p><p>The computer triple-beeped. <i>“Authorized. Replaying...”</i></p><p>The image of a grizzled, older Klingon male appeared on the screen. Unlike Kang, Kinna, or Mara, he had been unaffected by the Augment Virus, and had a large, impressive-looking forehead crest. He leaned forward, eyes squinting. <i>“Captain Kang, we have received your initial report and gone over it. We do recognize the difficulty in standard operations in the Neutral Zone, and acknowledge that you and your crew </i>are<i> working towards the goal of swaying the Equestrians to the side of the Empire. However, you are not making enough progress toward your objective. Also, Your science officer's assessment that the rulers of the most-powerful nation, these... alicorn princesses, are immune to current coercion techniques is rejected.”</i> He jabbed a finger at the screen. <i>“Make no mistake, Kang. If you cannot complete this assignment to the High Council's satisfaction, we will find someone who will. Gor'chuk out.”</i></p><p>The screen changed from Gor'chuk's upper torso to an image of the trefoil-symbol of the Klingon Empire. Kang stared at the screen for a few moments. “The short-sighted fool,” he finally growled out.</p><p>Mara's eyes widened. “Did that targ actually <i>read</i> our reports?”</p><p>Kinna crossed his arms. “He read them, Mara. He and the others in the High Command simply chose not to believe them. Or if they believed them, they felt that we would still somehow be able to overwhelm a literal sun and moon being used against our fleets.” He leaned forward. “Have you sent them any report about–”</p><p>Kang held up a hand, silencing Kinna. He stepped back until he was against the far bulkhead, then slid his way along to a camera and intercom panel mounted in the bulkhead. He slowly opened a panel below the lenses and pulled out several wires. Sparks shot out, but Kang remained steadfast as he closed the panel. He flipped a switch on the intercom and leaned in close to a speaker grille. “Bridge, this is Captain Kang. The security monitor in Conference Room Two has... malfunctioned. Send a repair crew down.” Kang kept his expression neutral, even as inwardly he grimaced. <i>That the High Command cannot trust a warrior’s oath, and must monitor us like this! </i></p><p>Tarqus' voice came over. <i>“Understood, Captain. A team should be down there in about... twenty minutes?”</i></p><p>Kang looked to Mara, then to Kinna. Both nodded at him. “An acceptable timeframe. Kang out.” He turned the intercom off, then turned and walked back to the table. “Now we may speak freely.”</p><p>Kinna looked to Mara once more. “Have you sent them any report about the trilithium weaponry that will be developed in the next century?”</p><p>Mara shook her head. “No. Not that it matters. Any such weaponry is more in the realm of fantasy at our current stage.”</p><p>Kinna snorted. “Do you really think such things would matter to them?”</p><p>Kang walked back to the table, eyes narrow and lips curled back in a snarl. “Gor'chuk is a fool if he believes we possess <i>any</i> means of conquering Equestria. Yes, in a hundred years we may destroy their sun. And with it, we destroy the system they wish to conquer.” He leaned heavily on the table, all the energy seeming to drain from his body.</p><p>Mara and Kinna exchanged a look. Mara rose from her seat and walked around to Kang's side. “Then what shall you do?”</p><p>Kang stood there for almost a minute before straightening up. “In this case, perhaps it is best for me to do nothing! Perhaps the Empire does not deserve such information, or a treaty with Equestria!”</p><p>Kinna slowly stood up, eyes wide. “Captain, are you sure?” He held his hands up. “I mean no disrespect, Captain!”</p><p>Kang locked eyes with his first officer. “But you do question such notions?” He slowly smiled. “Good. I do not like sycophants. You are right to question them, but in the end it is <i>my</i> decision.”</p><p>Kinna relaxed slightly. “Of course, Captain.”</p><p>Kang breathed in deep before continuing. “Perhaps the Empire <i>does</i> need Praxis, to wake itself up and shake the warmongers's power base.” He crossed his arms. “I have a meeting with Celestia, Luna, and Twilight Sparkle in two days. There, I shall announce our withdrawal from negotiations. If it takes our near-annihilation to wake them from their idiocy, then so be it!”</p>

<p>Kirk leaned forward, hands clasped behind his back and holding onto a suitcase. He and his command crew stood just outside the room with the mirror leading to Canterlot High. The mirror had been activated, an energy vortex swirling out of it, with Spike standing in front. He turned to his fellow crew. “Now, please remember. They're both still teenagers, and rather large fans of the show. They're... <i>trying</i> their best to restrain themselves.”</p><p>Bones chuckled slightly. “No need to worry, Jim. I'm rather flattered they think so highly of us. It's rather humbling, actually.”</p><p>Uhura nodded, smiling. “I think we can handle the two ladies, Captain. They've done a lot of good for us.”</p><p>Sulu looked to her, nodding. “Lord knows I'm glad I know about the threat to Demora. I owe them a lot.”</p><p>Inside the room, Sunset Shimmer emerged from the portal, clad in her Starfleet outfit. She trotted up to Spike's side and bowed her head. “Spike, good to see you!” She looked around. “So, do <i>you</i> know what the surprise is?”</p><p>Spike barked a laugh. “Sorry, Sunset, but I promised Twilight not to say anything.”</p><p>Just then, Trixie and Twilight walked through the portal, Trixie also wearing her outfit from before. “No, Twilight! From the chest! You are a Klingon! Your words must carry!” Trixie waved a foreleg. “Now repeat after me. 'choS Sparkle ram wov puqbe'!”</p><p>Twilight cleared her throat. “'choS Sparkle ram wov puqbe'!”</p><p>Trixie slowly nodded. “Hmm, not too shabby. We'll have to continue working on this, of course.”</p><p>Sunset looked over her shoulder. “Good thing summer vacation's coming up and you two can have the time to work on that.” She turned, trotted over to the Twilight opposite Trixie, then spun around. “Trixie, think we can work a schedule for this?”</p><p>Trixie scowled. “Dammit, Sunset! I'm a magician, not a secretary!” Her eyes went wide. “I can't believe I said that.” She grinned. “I wonder what Bones would think about my impression if he ever heard it.”</p><p>Twilight and Spike exchanged a look, eyes blinking. Twilight looked back to the pair. “Well, funny you should mention that...” She turned to the doorway. “Captain Kirk? You and the others can come out, now!”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie looked to each other, their eyes wide and widening by the second. Sunset turned back to Twilight. “What?”</p><p>Before Twilight could respond, Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov walked through the door. Kirk walked up to the ponies and dragon, suitcase in one hand. He dropped to one knee. “Thank you, Twilight.” He looked to Sunset and Trixie. “I... <i>hope</i> we didn't startle you.”</p><p>Bones spoke up. “And for the record, Miss Lulamoon? That <i>is</i> a pretty good impression. Although I don't think I'm <i>that</i> gravelly.” His brow furrowed. “And I don’t say that <i>all</i> the time, do I?”</p><p>Trixie slowly looked to Bones. She swallowed, then sucked in a deep breath before speaking. “T-I meant n-no disrespect, sir.”</p><p>Spock arched an eyebrow. “Considering our prior encounters with us, Miss Lulamoon, it would be illogical to assume offense was intended.”</p><p>Kirk held the suitcase out. “Trixie, Sunset, in gratitude for your actions, Princess Sparkle has arranged a... <i>gift</i> for you both.” His thumbs slid along the suitcase's clasps, unlocking them and opening it up. He tilted it in their direction. Inside were two silver picture frames, each with an identical photo. It was a cast photo from <i>Star Trek</i>, on the set of the bridge. The main cast was there, with Kirk in the command chair, the rest surrounding him. They were looking at the camera, most of them smiling, except Spock. And beneath each of them was a signature. Except instead of the actors or actress, it was 'James Kirk', 'Spock', 'Leonard McCoy', and so on.</p><p>Sunset leaned in close. She let out a sharp gasp as her brain processed the contents. She looked up to Kirk, eyes watery. “I... this is...” She looked to Twilight. “<i>How?!”</i></p><p>Twilight lowered her head, blushing slightly. “I... managed to slip through the mirror, find Canterlot High's Pinkie Pie, and arrange for her to make a little purchase over the internet. I brought it back and Captain Kirk's command staff were gracious enough to sign them for you.”</p><p>Sunset slowly floated the picture frames out of the suitcase. She looked up at Kirk, then over at the others. “I can't even <i>begin</i> to–”</p><p>Trixie snorted and <i>slammed</i> a hoof onto the floor. “That's it! Trixie can't do this anymore!” She trotted forward. “Okay, I am going to get this out! And no one is gonna stop me!” She jabbed a hoof in the air. “Thank you!”</p><p>The <i>Enterprise's</i> command staff looked at each other in confusion. “Well, you're welcome, lass,” Scotty finally said. “But for what?”</p><p>Trixie swallowed. “I know you're not the actors and actress from the show, but still, I am going to say this. I remember when I was a young girl, sitting on Daddy's lap as we watched the show for the first time. Hell, he and Mom first <i>met</i> at a Star Trek convention!</p><p>“Your show was made fifty years ago, yet so <i>much</i> of it is relevant today. There's so much that you said that we have to remember. That yes we're savages, but we <i>can</i> rise above it. That we can choose not to kill, that we can show mercy and compassion to our enemies. Different groups of people can come together to create something much bigger and better than alone.”</p><p>By now tears were openly flowing down Trixie's cheeks. “T-I was something of a lonely kid, starved for attention.” She glanced over her shoulder at Sunset and smiled wanly. “It's why I use the third-person so much.” She looked back at the crew. “You showed me a place that we could all be accepted, where I could be Trixie Lulamoon. And it wasn't just me! I think it's reasonable for me to be able to say I speak for millions of people when I say that, and when I again say, thank you.” She swallowed and took a couple of steps back. Her head dipped low, even as her cheeks turned crimson. “I'm sorry,” she whispered, voice barely audible.</p><p>Sunset walked up to Trixie’s side and wrapped both forelegs around her in a tight hug.</p><p>Silence reigned in the room for close to a minute. Kirk stood up and walked over to Spock. He leaned in and whispered something to his first officer. Spock looked to Trixie, then Sunset. He then nodded to Kirk, who stepped back and turned around, hands outstretched. “I do... <i>apologize</i>. The second part of the surprise slipped our minds.”</p><p>Twilight blinked. “'Second part'?” She gasped as Spike elbowed her in the ribs. “Oof! I mean, yes! The second part!” She leaned forward, brow furrowing ever so slightly. “So… what’s the second part again?”</p><p>Kirk pulled his communicator out and flipped it open. “Why a tour of the <i>Enterprise</i>, Princess.” He held his communicator close to his mouth. <i>“Enterprise</i>, stand by for transport.” He glanced down at Trixie and Sunset. “Unless of course you’d prefer… not to?”</p><p>Sunset and Trixie exchanged a <i>long</i> look. Trixie’s head shot around as she looked up at Kirk. She opened her mouth, but Sunset <i>crammed</i> her hoof in before she could speak. “Captain, we would be…” She swallowed and steeled herself before continuing, “honored.”</p><p>Trixie merely nodded, tears in her eyes.</p><p>Kirk smiled. He looked to his senior staff. “We’ll meet you up there.”</p><p>Spock nodded. “We shall transport back to the <i>Enterprise</i> in ten minutes, Captain.” He looked down to Sunset and Trixie. “Enjoy the tour.”</p><p>Kirk knelt down close to the two ponies. “Energize.”</p><hr/><p>Twilight  and Spike stood outside the Castle of Friendship. It was early the next day and five large wooden wagons overflowing with cloudy-white crystals approached them. The front wagon was being towed by Igneous Rock, with Maud at his side. </p><p>Igneous stopped a dozen paces from Twilight, unhitched himself from the wagon, and trotted up, Maud by his side. They stopped short of her and bowed. “Princess Sparkle,” he said, bowing his head. Maud followed suit, the others also bowing to her.</p><p>Twilight blushed slightly at their actions. She reached out and gently tilted Igneous’ head up. “I appreciate that, but please, no bowing. We’re all friends, here.” She looked to the others. “Well, eventually.”</p><p>Igneous stepped back and turned to the other earth ponies. “If I may, let me introduce my fellow rock farmers.” He stepped up to a slate-gray stallion, a younger-looking mare, and a colt that looked nigh-identical to the stallion. “This is Tallus Granite, his daughter Shale, and his son Nugget.” He moved onto a mare with a rather bright-white coat. “This is Feldspar Quartz.” He waved at three mares. “And her daughters Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl.”</p><p>He finally approached four stallions, all of similar build. “This is Jadeite, his older brother Nephrite, their younger brother Zoisite, and Zoisite’s husband Kunzite.”</p><p>Twilight turned her head, making eye contact with everyone there. “I’m very pleased to meet you all. I’m also very glad you all brought the wagons.” Her horn glowed and two tricorders floated out of her saddlebags, one of them settling into Spike’s grip. She held the other one up high. “These are called ‘tricorders’. They’re machines used by the Federation and Empire to tell them things that their eyes can’t see.” Her brow furrowed slightly. “They’re like… locating spells used by unicorns.”</p><p>Igneous spoke up. “Aye, Princess Sparkle. Lieutenant Commander Scott and Commander Kellet, son of Grix, demonstrated their operation to my family. They’re very useful.” He looked to Tallus. “We have found five new veins of precious minerals.”</p><p>Nephrite stepped forward, eyes wide. “I <i>knew</i> it! I knew that someday the stars would aid Equestria!”</p><p>Zoisite rolled his eyes and buried his face in a foreleg.</p><p>Twilight blinked. “Well, you might not be wrong.” She looked to Spike. “Now Spike and I will both scan the crystals, for backup. Spike, you remember the instructions Spock gave you, right?”</p><p>Spike waved her off. “Yeah, yeah.” He flipped the top panel up and pressed some buttons. He stared at the screen. “No, wait…” he flipped another and turned a knob. The tricorder <i>whirred</i> to life, And Spike waved it about, grinning. “Told you!”</p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes. “Yes, Spike.” She glanced to the rock farmers. “If you’ll excuse me for a moment?” At their nods, she began walking around the wagons, waving the tricorder around. “Yup, yup. Definitely, yup.” She finally came to a stop where she had started from. She held the tricorder up in the air. “If I’m reading this right, all the crystals in those wagons are pure, stable, dilithium crystals.”</p><p>Spike walked over to her and waved his own tricorder about. “Same here, Twilight.” He looked back down at it. “It’s also detecting something called…” He squinted at the screen. “Verteron particles?”</p><p>Twilight looked over his shoulder at the tricorder’s screen. “I’ll look at that later. Thanks for your help, Spike.”</p><p>Maud spoke up. “This definitely changes things. I’m very excited for the future,” she said, her expression remaining as stoic as ever.</p><p>Tallus and Feldspar walked up to Twilight, flanking Igneous. “Princess, pardon the question, but I still do not understand why the weeds would be so valuable to the Federation or the Empire,” Feldspar said, her eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Twilight waggled her head back and forth. “Well, I can understand your confusion and suspicion. It turns out what we’ve always considered ‘weeds’ are key components of their starships.” She leaned in close. “And this might be the key to securing Equestria’s future in the galactic community.”</p><p>Feldspar looked to to Igneous. “I’m glad to see you weren’t joking about this,” she drawled out. “A much welcome surprise from your usual tomfoolery.”</p><p>Twilight and Spike looked to her. “Sorry, what?” Twilight asked, a single strand of her mane coming loose.</p><p>Tallus nodded. “It’s true, Princess. Igneous can be quite the kidder and jokester.”</p><p>Maud nodded. “Pinkie and I get our sense of humor from him,” she said.</p><p>Spike held up a claw, but Twilight placed a hoof on his shoulder. “Later, Spike. Just… later.” She cleared her throat before continuing. “Anyway! If you’ll step inside, I’d like to talk with you about the dilithium. I have some ideas and proposals to run by you all.”</p><p>Igneous rubbed his chin. “If I may venture a guess, Princess Sparkle, are you thinking of having us sell our dilithium crystals to the Federation and Empire?”</p><p>Twilight grinned. “You guess correctly, Igneous.” She looked around at everyone. “Now please keep in mind this is only a preliminary discussion. There’s a <i>lot</i> of information we’ll need from you, and from both the Federation and Empire, and it won’t be easy, either. In the end, though, I think all of us will benefit tremendously from working together.”</p><p>Igneous nodded. “I agree with you, Princess Sparkle. And I think I speak for the others when I say that.”</p><p>The other ponies their nodded, speaking their agreement with Igneous.</p><p>Twilight beamed. “Thank you, all.” She cantered to her left and waved a wing at the front doors. “Spike, could you lead them to the main conference room?”</p><p>Spike straightened up and tossed Twilight a salute. “My pleasure!” He marched inside, arms swinging. Igneous and Maud quickly followed, the others trailing behind.</p><p>Twilight let out a sigh. Her shoulders slouched slightly, some of the tension melting away. “Step one out of several thousand, done,” she said, before walking into her castle and closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Twilight stood in Canterlot Castle’s throne room, a pair of saddlebags slung across her flank. Celestia, Cadance, and Luna stood by her, just behind. </p><p>For perhaps the dozenth time, Twilight floated a scroll out of her saddlebag, unfurled it, and looked it over. She then rolled it back up and slid it back into her saddlebag.</p><p>Cadance trotted up to Twilight’s side and placed a hoof on her shoulder. “Twilight, in through the nose, out through the muzzle. All right? Remember?”</p><p>Twilight’s nostrils flared as she went through her breathing exercise a few times. Her shoulders sagged slightly and she seemed to calm down. “Thank you, Cadance,” she said, smiling.</p><p>Celestia walked up to Twilight’s other side, opposite Cadance. “Don’t worry, Twilight. I’m certain both Kirk and Kang will accept your proposal.”</p><p>As if on cue, a pair of communicators placed on the Solar Throne’s armrests chirped. Celestia’s horn glowed as she floated them over, flipping them open. “<i>Enterprise, K'naiah's Pride, </i>this is Princess Celestia. We are ready to receive your landing parties. Acknowledge. <i>K'naiah's Pride</i> first, this time.”</p><p><i>“Princess Celestia, Captain Kang and Science Officer Mara are prepared to beam down.”</i></p><p><i>“Princess, Captain Kirk and Mister Spock are </i>also<i> ready to beam down.”</i></p><p>Celestia nodded, smiling. “Energize, then.” She looked to Twilight as she returned the communicators to their resting place. “You’ll be fine, Twilight.”</p><p>Luna spoke up as she trotted up to the group. “Indeed, Twilight Sparkle. Both the Federation and Empire would be fools to turn your proposal down.”</p><p>Any further conversation was cut off as four columns of light appeared in front of the alicorns, quickly resolving into Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, Captain Kang, and Science Officer Mara. Kirk looked around, quickly focusing on Kang. “Kang, good to–” </p><p>Kang held up his right and hand and waved Kirk off. “I must speak, Kirk. It is a matter of vital importance.” He walked up to the quartet of alicorns and held up a datapad. “Two days ago, I received a message from General Gor’Chuk of the Klingon High Command.” He glanced to Kirk. “I believe you know the name?”</p><p>Kirk nodded, staying silent for the moment. </p><p>Kang looked straight ahead once more, his eyes locking onto each pair of pony eyes. “I cannot play the message for you, but I <i>can</i> inform you that the shortsighted idiot dismissed Mara’s report about how foolish it would be to try and invade your planet. He also ordered me to attempt coercive techniques on you and stop at nothing to sway you to the Empire. Therefore, I have decided to terminate negotiations with you and leave for Q’onoS. The Empire does not deserve your alliance. The High Command has shown itself to be dishonorable.” He turned to Kirk and thumped his chest. “You are more Klingon than those spineless <i>gagh</i> at the homeworld. I cede to you, Kirk.” He pulled out his communicator and flipped it open. “Kang to–”</p><p>“Wait! You can’t leave! Not like that!”</p><p>Silence permeated the throne room after the outburst. Everyone slowly turned to the source of the cry, everyone looking to Twilight Sparkle. For her, she simply stood there, eyes wide, mouth slightly agape, and cheeks reddened slightly.</p><p>Kang looked down at Twilight and crossed his arms. “And why is that, Princess?” he asked, his voice an icy chill.</p><p>Twilight’s legs locked. She swallowed, but she stepped forward, eyes on Kang. “It would be… wrong to punish the entirety of the Klingon Empire for the actions of some bureaucrats. It wouldn’t be… honorable.”</p><p>Kang snorted. “The Empire needs to have its eyes opened, Princess. There are events in the future that would be changed by any alliance with Equestria, events that will help to steer us back on the right path.” He shook his head. “No. It would be far too difficult for one Klingon, or one Klingon and his crew, to change things, even <i>with</i> the information Sunset Shimmer and Trixie Lulamoon provided us.” He brought his communicator up once more. “Kang to–”</p><p>Kirk spoke up. “I knew you were many things, Kang. I did not think… <i>coward</i> was one of them.” </p><p>The temperature in the throne room seemed to drop by several dozen degrees. Mara slowly turned and walked over to Kirk. “It would be <i>very</i> wise of you to retract that insult, Kirk. Or I’ll take a pound of flesh as compensation!” she snarled out.</p><p>Spock stepped forward, placing himself between Kirk and Mara. “Captain Kirk has not insulted Captain Kang. He has merely stated a fact.”</p><p>Kirk quickly placed a hand on Spock’s shoulder and guided him to his left. “Thank you, Mister Spock, but I can handle things.”</p><p>Kang also moved Mara to the side. “And I thank you as well, my wife, but this is <i>my</i> battle, not yours.”</p><p>Twilight opened her mouth, but a translucent barrier formed in front of her. She looked to her right as Celestia’s head appeared in her vision. “Princess?” she asked.</p><p>Celestia glanced to Kirk and Kang. “This right here is the critical moment, Twilight. Here, they have to be able to work it out themselves, to agree together. Kirk <i>must</i> convince Kang to hear you out on his own.”</p><p>Kirk and Kang started circling one another. Kang waved Kirk off. “I will not listen to your words, Kirk. I know what you will try to tell me, but I will not listen. I am leaving.”</p><p>Kirk shrugged. “Very well. I meant what I said, Kang. I never thought you a… <i>coward</i>. You’re stubborn, proud, but no coward. Turning your back on Princess Sparkle here, though?” His lips curled up in a sneer. “<i>That</i>… is cowardly.”</p><p>Kang snorted. “I know what you’re trying to do, Kirk. You’re trying to make me angry. It won’t work, here.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head. “I’m not <i>trying </i>to make you angry. I’m trying to open your eyes, Kang.” he suddenly waved Kang off and turned. “Although I’m probably wasting my time. After all, it’s typical of a Klingon to retreat from a battle he can’t win, to tuck tail and run off. You can’t… help it.”</p><p>Kang’s lips curled back. “Your skills in diplomacy and cunning are lacking, Kirk. I am leaving, now.”</p><p>Kirk shook his head. You already said you were going, Kang. Of course, to expect a… <i>Klingon</i> to honor his word was foolish of me. An empire of cowards, of backstabbers. You never know when they’ll pull the knife out and stab you, preferably in the—”</p><p>Kang <i>lunged</i> forward. He grabbed Kirk by his shirt with one hand, the other pulling his <i>d’k tagh</i> from its sheath and holding it up. The twins secondary blades <i>clicked</i> open. “If I stab you, Kirk, it will not be from behind!” He shouted, eyes blazing.</p><p>Kirk met Kang’s stare, locking his eyes with Kang’s. “So, now you defend the Empire? The people within? I thought they weren’t… worthy of being defended.”</p><p>Kang stood there for a long minute, before letting go of Kirk’s shirt and sheathing his blade. “They are, Kirk, no matter what you <i>or</i> I say.”</p><p>Kirk tugged at his shirt. “So this is how you help them, by turning away from the best possible chance you’d ever have?” He held up his hand. “Kang, you want to help them. I <i>see</i> it in your eyes, but you can’t help them by turning away! You can help them, Kang. It won’t be easy, but it <i>is</i> possible. People can change, Kang.” He tapped his chest. “Do you think humans, or… <i>Vulcans</i> were always like this? Both our people’s hands are drenched in millennia of bloodshed. We both nearly… destroyed ourselves! But we learned, and we’re <i>still</i> learning how to rise above our nature, to be the people we know we can be!”</p><p>Kang drew himself up. “One Klingon cannot change an entire empire!”</p><p>Kirk half-smiled. “But he can start. And you’re no ordinary Klingon, Kang. You’re a… <i>starship captain</i>. Only one in a million can do what you or I do. It is our <i>duty</i> to make the tough decisions, to forge the right path ahead. No, it won’t be easy, but I’ll bet on you rather than against you!”</p><p>Kang’s expression softened. “Very well.” He leaned back slightly, eyes narrowing. “But… what do <i>you</i> gain from this, Kirk? Why bring the Empire back to the table?”</p><p>Kirk turned and glanced at Twilight. “On Equus, I’ve learned that friendship… is something that should be shared, that it’s a kind of… magic.”</p><p>Kang nodded. “And if you keep it to yourself, then no one will have it. It’s an interesting paradox, Kirk.” He stepped back and thumped his chest in salute. “You <i>are </i>an honorable human, Kirk. There is a place for you in <i>Sto-vo-kor</i>.”</p><p>Kirk returned the salute. “Thank you, Kang. And you… are honorable.”</p><p>Kang turned from Kirk and walked over to the quartet of alicorns. He bowed his head and locked eyes with Twilight. “My decision earlier was rash and ill-informed, Princess. I am… willing to listen to your proposal.”</p><p>Twilight kept her head up. “Thank you, Captain.” her horn glowed and two scrolls levitated out of her saddlebags. One floated over to Kirk, the other to Kang. “I think you’ll find this proposal concerning our dilithium weeds very enticing…”</p>

<p><i>Captain’s Log; Stardate 6014:29. After several days of negotiation, the Equestrian government has managed to secure political and economic agreements not only with the Federation, but the…</i> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">Klingon </span><i>Empire. Although diplomats will be sent in to put the finishing touches on the treaties, for the most part, a new era has begun here, on this small planet.</i></p><p><i>On a more personal note, I look back at the events that have occurred here, that have begun to… </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">shape </span><i>the course of this region of the galaxy. I wonder how much might have been planned by Celestia or Discord, and if they had any help from… </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">others</span><i>. One day I might solve that mystery.</i></p><hr/><p>Captain Kirk leaned back in his command chair. On the bridge’s main screen, the planet Equus could be seen to port. To starboard, the <i>K'naiah's Pride </i>could be seen,  keeping pace just ahead of the <i>Enterprise</i>.  “Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu.”</p><p>Sulu glanced around his control panel, adjusting several controls. “Aye, Captain. All controls show green.”</p><p>Kirk allowed himself a brief moment of rest, of reflection, of pride in his ship and crew. He looked around the bridge, at the crew. At <i>his</i> crew. A sense of satisfaction and pride welled within him.</p><p><i>Sulu sat at the helm station, Chekov to his right at navigation. Arex stood by Chekov, a datapad in his central hand. Chekov made some remark about there being forests of the Tree of Harmony outside Saint Petersburg. Sulu rolled his eyes and patted his younger friend on the shoulder.</i></p><p><i>Scotty sat at the engineering station, close to the turbolift alcove. Lieutenant Kyle stood next to him. Scotty looked up at Kyle and spoke. Kyle’s eyes widened, and the two men laughed, Kyle slapping his leg.</i></p><p><i>The turbolift doors themselves opened. Bones and M’Ress stepped out, the former heading for Kirk, while the latter walked over to Uhura, sitting almost directly behind Kirk at the communications station. M’Ress handed Uhura a datapad. The two women spoke, Uhura smiling brightly.</i></p><p><i>Spock stood at his science station, bent over slightly. He peered into his station’s viewer, adjusting some controls right below it.</i></p><p>For a brief moment of eternity, everything was fine. Everyone was where they should be, where they were <i>meant</i> to be.</p><p>And the moment, like all others, passed. As it should, as it was <i>meant</i> to pass.</p><p>Bones stopped right behind Kirk’s chair, grinning. “Well, Jim. Looks like we pulled another one out of the fire.”</p><p>Kirk glanced behind his shoulder. “Indeed, Bones. Although I think we’ll leave the finer details to any… <i>ambassadors</i> coming this way. More their purview, I believe.”</p><p>Uhura raised her hand and adjusted her earpiece. “Captain, We’re receiving a message from Canterlot. It’s Princess Celestia.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Thank you, Commander. Open the channel.”</p><p>Uhura turned a knob. “Princess, go ahead.”</p><p>Celestia’s voice came over the bridge’s intercom. <i>“Thank you. Captain, I wish you and your crew a safe journey. If you’re ever in this sector, feel free to stop by for shore leave. I think Pinkie Pie wants to throw a somewhat less… formal party next time you’re here.”</i></p><p>Kirk bowed his head slightly. “We’ll keep that in mind, Princess. Thank you.”</p><p>There was silence before another voice came over, this one Twilight’s. <i>“Captain, I too want to say thank you. You’ve helped Equestria take our first step to the stars. You’ve helped us broaden our horizons. I hope that the next time we meet, it will be out </i>there<i>, among the stars.”</i></p><p>Kirk smiled. “Don’t keep us waiting too long, Princess. There’s a lot to see out here. It can be dangerous, and even a bit… <i>risky</i>.”</p><p>Twilight giggled slightly. <i>“But isn’t risk your business, Captain?”</i></p><p>Kirk grinned. “Very good, Princess. Let’s meet up on Earth for lunch in about, say… ten years?”</p><p><i>“I’ll write it on my calendar! Twilight out.”</i></p><p>Bones patted Kirk on the shoulder. “You might wanna pencil that in, Jim. Considering what we’ve seen of her, Twilight probably has <i>every</i> intention of keeping that appointment.”</p><p>Kirk nodded to his old friend. “I don’t doubt it, Bones.”</p><p>Uhura spoke up again. “Captain, we’re now receiving a signal from the <i>Pride</i>. Audio and visual this time.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Thank you, Uhura. Onscreen.” He stood up and walked forward a few steps as the main viewscreen changed.</p><p>Kang stood in a bridge very similar to the <i>Enterprise’s</i>. Mara stood behind him to his right, Kinna on his left. Kellett could be seen at a duty station, while Tarqus manned the helm. Worf could be seen at another one of the aft duty stations. Kang thumped his chest, then shot his right arm out in a Klingon salute. <i>“Qapla’ to you Kirk, son of George!”</i></p><p>Kirk returned the salute. <i>“Qapla,</i> to you, Kang, son of … <i>K'naiah.”</i></p><p>Kang lifted his head slightly. <i>“We are returning to the Empire. Kor and Koloth have responded to me. We shall begin the hunt for the Albino.”</i> He paused. <i>“Kruge will be accompanying us.”</i></p><p>Kirk nodded, half-smiling. “I’m glad you took my advice, Kang.”</p><p>Kang’s head twitched a bit before he finally stopped and looked at Sulu. <i>“Commander Sulu, we shall keep you apprised of our success.”</i></p><p>Sulu nodded. “Thank you, Captain. I wish you good hunting. If you <i>do</i> need help, I’ll be there.”</p><p>Kang nodded to him. “<i>”Thank you, Commander. Kahless willing, we will deal with him quickly and decisively.”</i> He looked up at Kirk once more. <i>“We shall work somewhat… quieter than you to change the Empire, Kirk, but by Kahless, I and my crew shall do what we can.”</i></p><p>Kirk nodded. “If there is… <i>anything</i> we can do to help, Kang, ask. Friends shouldn’t go it alone.”</p><p>Kang snorted. <i>“I never thought I’d call an earther a friend, yet here we are. Thank you, Kirk. Until our next encounter.”</i> With that, the main viewscreen changed once more to Equus from orbit.</p><p>Kirk went back and sat once more in his chair. “It’s a start,” he said, settling back.</p><p>Uhura spoke once more. “Captain, we are now receiving a transmission from Starfleet Command. It’s…” Her brow furrowed slightly as she adjusted some controls. “Commodore Robert Wesley?”</p><p>Bones looked to her, then to Kirk. “Wait a second, Bob? Last I heard he was still governor of Mantilles.”</p><p>Kirk glanced to him. “After the incident with the… cosmic cloud, Bob decided to return to Starfleet. He figured he had more to offer there.” He motioned to the viewscreen. “Put him through please, Uhura.”</p><p>The image changed to an older human male, gray hair and a somewhat lined face. He nodded before speaking. <i>“Jim, good to see you. Just about everyone here at Starfleet Command is buzzing about the great work you and your crew have done on this mission.”</i></p><p>Kirk smiled. “Thank you, Bob. Although I have a feeling this call isn’t just to… <i>sing</i> our praises.”</p><p>Bob nodded. <i>“Correct, Captain. You’re getting new orders. We want you back at Earth as soon as possible. We have a new mission for you, then the </i>Enterprise<i> is getting its refit ahead of schedule. We’re going to try and intercept V’Ger as soon as possible.”</i></p><p>Kirk leaned forward. “Makes sense, Bob. Will Epsilon IX be evacuated?”</p><p><i>“It will be, although the station itself will remain and its sensors operated remotely, just in case we need to get scans of V’Ger.”</i> A wan smile crossed Bob’s mouth. <i>“I’m afraid we couldn’t get much from the movie itself.”</i> He held up a hand. <i>“And the Klingons have already told us they’re gonna keep any ships </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">far away</span><i> from its projected flight path. With luck, we should be able to nip this one in the bud.”</i></p><p>Kirk laced his fingers together. “And the mission beforehand? Or is it classified?”</p><p>Bob smiled. <i>“Oh, no. We’ll be sending the </i>Enterprise<i> back to 1986. There’s a pair of humpback whales named George and Gracie to pick up, along with a marine biologist named Gillian Taylor. I’m sure you can work your usual charms, Jim.”</i> He turned his head slightly. “<i>And of course, Mister Scott will help a certain Doctor Marcus Nichols with the invention of transparent aluminum.”</i></p><p>Scotty turned in his chair to the main viewscreen. “It’ll be a pleasure and an honor, sir!” he said, grinning.</p><p>Bob glanced to his right for a moment. <i>“Well, then. We’ll see you at Starbase One within the week. Safe travels, </i>Enterprise.<i> Starfleet Command, out.”</i></p><p>Bones nodded and patted Kirk on the shoulder. “Well, good to see they’re not locking those episodes or movies up in some dusty old warehouse in the middle of nowhere.”</p><p>Spock turned from his station and walked over. “It would be illogical to not utilize such a vast amount of information, Doctor. With proper planning, many crises can be averted, or at least minimized.”</p><p>Bones crossed his arms. “And since <i>when</i> have you known Starfleet Command to be ruled by logic, Mister Spock?”</p><br/><p>Any such rejoinder was silenced as Kirk held his hands up. “Gentlemen, please. We have a pressing engagement a week from now and about… two hundred eighty-three years in the past.” He looked to his left. “Mister Scott, engine status?”</p><p>Scotty looked over several screens at the engineering station. “Everything’s in the green, Captain. We’re all ready. Just give the word.”</p><p>Kirk straightened up in his chair. “Then the word is given. The information Sunset and Trixie gave us is a… <i>guide</i> to the future. But the future can only be met head-on. Mister Sulu, Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Then set a course for Sector 001, warp six.”</p><p>Sulu’s hands danced across his control panel as he twisted dials and flipped switches. “Aye, Captain. Course set.”</p><p>Chekov checked his own displays. “Warp drive ready at your command, Captain.”</p><p>Kirk nodded. “Engage.”</p><p>The <i>Enterprise</i> slid out of orbit, gracefully spinning about in a tight arc. The front half of the ship suddenly stretched out impossibly long as the warp drive activated. It hung there for a moment before the aft half <i>snapped</i> forward, sending the <i>Enterprise</i> hurtling through space, on its way to its next adventure.</p><hr/><p>Twilight paced back and forth, a clipboard hovering in front of her face. It had been three weeks since the <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>K'naiah's Pride</i> had departed Equus. Even now, diplomats and aides from the Federation and Empire were in Canterlot, beginning formal negotiations. Twilight, however, was <i>quite</i> a ways away, in the middle of the flat plains where Equestria’s rock farms were located. A long translucent cylinder stretched between two rather large tanks, each one filled with a glowing, pulsating liquid. A few control panels and monitors were mounted to the tanks, charts and other readouts flashing on the monitors.</p><p>Spike stood in front of one of the tanks. He craned his neck as he looked at one of the monitors. “Okay, pressure looks stable. I think…” He looked to Twilight. “So on a scale of one to ten, how dangerous is this?”</p><p>Twilight slid her clipboard into the saddlebag on her left flank. She wore a pair of goggles, a lab coat, and heavy boots. “Maybe a six,” she said, walking over to Spike’s side. She looked the monitors over. “We’re out in the middle of nowhere, the closest rock farm or settlement about twenty miles away. According to my calculations, Moondancer’s calculations, and Minuette’s, any possible explosion won’t harm anyone.” She leaned in close to Spike. “And if anything does, you and I are just one teleport away to safety.”</p><p>Spike let out a breath. “Well, okay.” He looked the entire apparatus over. “Gotta admit, Twilight. This is pretty impressive!”</p><p>Twilight broke from Spike’s side and walked the length of the cylinder between the tanks. “I couldn’t have done it without my number-one assistant,” she said, looking back and smiling at Spike. She looked to the cylinder once more and a thick bulge in its center. “All right, in five minutes, Equestria’s first matter/antimatter continuum-distortion engine will go online!” She paused and her head lowered slightly. “And… hopefully not explode in the process.”</p><p>Spike walked back to Twilight’s side and gently elbowed her in her barrel. “Twilight, all kidding aside? After three weeks working on this with you, I have faith it will go well.”</p><p>Twilight turned and leaned into Spike, nuzzling him. “Thank you.” She looked back to the engine. A small recorder floated out of her saddlebag and up to her mouth. It <i>clicked</i> on, and she spoke into it. “This is Twilight Sparkle, recording. I am about to fire up Engine Prototype-One for its first full-power test. All monitors and readouts show green.” She put the recorder back and let out a breath. “Well, here’s another first step.”</p><p>Spike ran up to her side. “So, after this, then what? I don’t think we can just fly the engine to Earth.”</p><p>Twilight shook her head. She and Spike walked away from the engine, over to a rocky outcrop. “Oh, no, Spike. We’ll need an actual hull, navigational deflectors, an inertial dampening system, a structural integrity field, actual computers for navigation and a dozen other devices, and Celestia knows what else!” She spun around to face the engine. “I told Captain Kirk I’d meet him on Earth in ten years. But going over what Equestria has to <i>do</i> in that time?” Her ears flattened against her skull. “I just don’t know, Spike.”</p><p>Spike walked around to Twilight’s front and leaned in close. “Twilight, I’m not sure what… half those things are you listed, but I do know one thing. And that’s when you set your mind to something, you <i>do</i> it.” He reached out and gently patted her cheek. “And you won’t be alone, either. You’ll make that appointment, Twilight. I believe in you!”</p><p>Twilight stared at Spike, her eyes glistening slightly. “No, Spike. <i>We’ll</i> make that appointment.” She gently lifted Spike with her magic and deposited him onto her back with her magic. She stared at the engine. “Ready?”</p><p>Spike nodded. “Ready, Twilight. Engage!”</p><p>Twilight sucked in a breath. “All right. Here goes everything!” Her horn glowed once more. A lever on each of the tanks slid down. </p><p>And the universe opened up.</p>
