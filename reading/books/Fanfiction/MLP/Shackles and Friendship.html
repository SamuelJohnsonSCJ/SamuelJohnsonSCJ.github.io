				<summary>A HiE fic filled with light comedy and a bit of adventure. Enjoy.</summary>
<p>       'What is it about humans that urges them seek out so many endeavors in order to feed their desires? Greed, power, family, friends, philosophy, knowledge; infinite goals and infinite reasons behind them. Whoever or whatever created these beings are either cunning; to create self motivating creatures that will constantly push the limits of what's possible, or downright cruel; never truly allowing them to feel true fulfillment or satisfaction. The point is humans were created with a void, a missing piece left intentionally empty never to be filled, an undying hunger.'	 </p><p>A bit grim right? The names Rodney, and in case you're wondering, this is the story of my life. A life of Magic, Gods, and regrettably, Ponies. Yeah, freakin-multi-techno-collored-goody-ponies. <br/>But it's not all bad really, got way healthier with a more green diet. Though the lack of meat can be painful at times, that one landed me in less than desired situations. I get to screw with innocent ponies on a regular basis. Didn't kill myself or everyone else with me either. So not a bad deal really, even ended up retiring as teacher.</p><br/><br/><br/><p>Teen for language and some adult themes.<br/>This takes place before season 3.</p><p>HIATUS: Currently at a programmer's boot camp. Will be done late June 2015. </p><p>AN: If you can see past my cruddy writing skills there's plenty to tickle your funny bones, I hope. First attempt at writing a fic.</p>			</details>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Prologue</p><hr/><blockquote><p>Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p>As you have requested, I have focused all my efforts in determining the cause behind this...bleeding of magic. Unfortunately, as time goes on it has become increasingly difficult for me to remain efficient, the simple task of holding up a book with magic quickly becomes exhausting. Other unicorns like Rarity have also started to feel similar effects. Going about daily life has become quite difficult for her. She, along with many others, have grown increasingly fearful. </p><p>The same could be said about other ponies. Rainbow Dash and other pegasi are finding it more difficult to control and manipulate the weather. The number of rogue weather clouds in the last week alone nearly doubled the past two months. But most of all they’re just as frightened as everypony else. Rainbow Dash told me that flying tires her out much more quickly with each passing day while she takes longer to recover. </p><p>So far the mayor’s efforts have been successful in quelling the panic. She has also recommended that Cloudsdale be lowered closer to the ground as a safety measure, in the event that the whole place breaks apart. If this magical bleed is not stopped soon, I fear that is exactly what will happen. </p><p>At first I believed the earth ponies were the least affected, but unfortunately I was wrong. The Apple family has informed me that they’ve become weaker all around. They are now unable to maintain the whole farm by themselves, though Applejack certainly gave it her all. Finally the final proof comes from Pinky Pie, earlier today I caught sight of her trotting. Trotting! No skipping, no singing, no hopping. Just, trotting. I fear that earth ponies are slowly losing their natural vitality and endurance. </p><p>What will happen if this phenomenon start to affect their affinity in flora? If it does, how is our food storage? What will happen to us unicorns who rely solely on magic? Magic makes us special! Imagine the chaos if we lose control of the weather and-</p><p>I apologize Your Highness, I did not mean to lose focus.</p><p>Fortunately, despite the many problems and distractions, I have been made some progress in uncovering something. By comparing how each city and town have been affected, I hoped to find some differences or irregularity that could point to an origin, and I did. </p><p>If my calculations are correct, Ponyville is losing much more magic than any other place this phenomenon have affected. Which strongly suggests that we are closest to the cause. </p><p>Alongside the mayor, I've coordinated search teams around town and beyond but to no avail. They found nothing that had any connection let alone explain why we’re losing magic. So I went back to the data, hoping that I might have missed something. With Spike’s help (actually it was he who noticed it first, as he is now bragging), I noticed the phenomenon radiates outwards, like a ripple when you throw a rock into a pond. With this new understanding, Spike and I have managed to calculate what I believe to be an origin point. </p><p>The Everfree Forest. </p><p>Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and myself are preparing to travel there as soon as possible. The origin is deeper than any of us have ever travelled, but should still be reachable in a day or two. Although I planned on bringing Spike in order to keep Your Highness update in our progress, I believe he is still too young for the journey. Which is why I will use a beacon spell, the same one you taught me, in order for you to locate and teleport once we’ve reached our destination.  </p><p>Hopefully we will find the reason behind this. Based on my calculations, the rate at which magic is bleeding grows with each passing day. We are quickly running out of time.</p><p>Your faithful student,</p><p>Twilight Sparkle</p><br/><p>P.S - I had to right this report several times as Spike kept burning them when he tried to send it. He’s losing magic as well. All the more reason to leave him behind.</p></blockquote>

<p>So here’s the prologue, at first I thought of writing it as a story like normal but having it written like a letter surprisingly works too. Anyways as I posted in the description this is not only my first fict but also my first attempt to write a story…EVER. Thus I value all comments and criticism so don’t hold back and hit me with everything you got. </p><p>[UPDATE: Quality rewrite]</p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-size:1.5em">﻿</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span> <br/>Chapter 1 – “Dafuq!?”<br/>Edited by Noxxels | Re-edited again by yours truly.<br/>I do not own My Little Pony, God knows I want to. </p><p>AN:The earlier chapter are very rough but the quality improves bit by bit per chapter, so please be a bit patient and hopefully you can still enjoy the story through it all. <br/>[UPDATE: Quality rewrite]</p><hr/><p>“TWO DAYS! I simply <i>cannot</i> stand this anymore. My mane is <i>completely</i> ruined and there’s dirt and mud all over my precious coat. It will take me <i>forever</i> to clean all this filth out!”</p><p>“Gosh darn’ it Rarity! It’s been tough on all of us ok, please ah’m begging yah keep it down. Yer gonna attract them monsters tah us.”</p><p>With that firm reminder Rarity bit her lower lip and surveyed the trees around her, afraid the Applejack’s worry might come true. The group had been traveling deeper into the Everfree Forest for two days straight and luckily their journey had been uneventful. Twilight suspected that the monsters in the forest were also suffering from the loss of magic, and were probably trying to conserve their strength. The ponies knew their goal was deep in the forest, but they didn’t exactly know how deep. Despite the near absurd amount of data she collected it was still difficult to calculate the exact location of the cause, all she has is a rough estimation. </p><p>“I know it’s tough Rarity but we’re almost there, whatever's been siphoning all the magic is really close now.” Twilight was just as tired and miserable, but she needed to keep the group together if they ever hoped to find the cause and stop it. </p><p>“No offense Twi but that’s what you said yesterday! How sure are you this time?” Rainbow Dash spoke with some anger behind her voice, but Twilight knew it came mostly because Dash has been grounded for far too long. Although the rainbow mare claimed it’s because she doesn’t want to attract any monster, Twilight suspected it was because Dash has lost far too much magic to be able fly. She hadn’t even seen her so much as hover since the first day. Fluttershy had been mostly quiet the entire journey, which seemed normal at first, but now it was starting to worry her.</p><p>“I'm sorry Dash, but with the limited data I've collected I was only able to calculate a rough estimate.” Truthfully, Twilight was also losing hope, even more so than the rest. If they didn’t reach their destination in time, she doubted even Princess Celestia could stop it. &quot;But we have to move on, if we don't stop it soon...”</p><p>“Hang on there sugarcube, how long is 'soon'?” Applejack had trotted over to Twilight's side.</p><p>*sigh* “If we don't reach it by today then that might just be it.” She admitted.</p><p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p><p><i>'I guess now's a good time as any.'</i> Twilight thought. </p><p>&quot;Based on my calculations on the day we left for the Everfree, the amount of magic lost was equivalent to somewhere near my entire magical reserve, and it has continue to grow since. *sigh* Now I'm still nothing compared to someone like the Princess. But if we don't stop it by today I estimate it would continue to grow past a point that even Princess Celestia and Luna can control. If that happens Equestria will continue to bleed magic until its all gone.&quot; They all froze in place and silence, none of them could imagine living on in a world without magic. Twilight was still laying it on easy, only she alone fully understood how massive the amount of magic Equestria had lost.</p><p>“We need to keep moving.” It was gentle, but there was a sense of determination behind the statement. </p><p>“Fluttershy?” Dash, as well as everypony else, was surprised by the usually timid mare's voice. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter if <i>we</i> can’t stop it, we still need to find it for the Princesses so they can teleport to us. We have to keep moving.” She spoke with even more determination and strength, though she was visibly shaking and definitely having a hard time standing.</p><p>“Darling is everything alright?” Rarity had always been the closest to Fluttershy, but even she had never heard or seen Fluttershy push herself this far.</p><p>“We ha-have to keep moving.” She states again while attempting to take a step forward. Her hoof shook unsteadily and eventually her determination failed to hold back the toll of the journey, she fell to the earth on her stomach with her hooves folded beneath her as she falls into exhaustion. </p><p>“FLUTTERSHY!” They all ran towards her with fear and worry. </p><p>“Fluttershy darling are you ok?” Rarity had practically dove to her side, sliding her coat in the mud, and forgetting all her worries in order to give her closest friend some comfort.</p><p>“She’s all spent up, she must have been pushing herself all this time. Fluttershy you could have told us you needed rest.” Twilight was aggravated by herself, being so focused on the mission she neglected her friend’s limits. </p><p>“W-we need *grunt* uh to keep moving.” Fluttershy was already trying to get back up on her hooves. </p><p>“Ah can carry her, ah may not be as strong as ah was before but ah’m still able to help her.” Applejack trotted over to Fluttershy’s side, and with the help of Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, managed to lift Fluttershy atop Applejack.  </p><p>“It’s ok Fluttershy, I’ll be sure to bake a big, BIG ‘Get Well Soon’ cake when we get back.” Pinkie was trying her best to be her merry self but everypony could clearly tell she was just as exhausted from both the journey and losing her magic, even her mane had lost it's trademark puff. Most of all everypony could actually keep up with what she’s saying, which was very unnerving. </p><p>They started to make progress again, though at a slower pace as Applejack needed to take careful steps in order to keep her precious cargo balanced. They continued on till the sun had started to reach the horizon, creating a red and orange blaze across the sky. Twilight was just barely holding on, hoping to reach the source by today’s end, when she noticed something in the air. </p><p>At first glance, it looked like a long piece of silver-white grass, however the way it swayed in the air made it look more like something liquid. It was then that she noticed there was no wind blowing around her. She saw more and more of them appearing around her. As her horn accidentally came into contact with one nearby she jumped and yelled in surprised. </p><p>“Twilight are you ok? Did these things hurt you?” Being the bearer of loyalty, Rainbow Dash was already standing next to Twilight, ready to defend her from any danger. </p><p>“I’m ok Dash, I was just surprised. It was like lightning hit me or something.” As Twilight collected herself she noticed something was different, she wasn’t as tired as she was just seconds ago. In fact, she felt quite recuperated and brimming with energy. She was probably ready to gallop in the Running of the Leaves marathon, and then realization came to her. </p><p>“Oh Celestia slap my flank with the sun!” Twilight saw Rainbow turned around and face her with a look between surprise, confusion, and amusement. </p><p>“What did you just say?” Rainbow was not used to hearing the usual level headed bookworm to swear like that in the open. </p><p>“Nevermind that. Girls do you know what these things are!?” All she saw were more puzzled faces. “These are pure energy, pure concentrated magical energy taking visible and physical form!” </p><p>“Eh not to burst ye’r bubble there sugarcube but don’t yah usually make them appear on ye’r horn when yah use one of yer spells?” Applejack, as well as the gang, still had that look of confusion. </p><p>“No, that’s only the spell taking form as it molds the magical energy and focuses it. But these are the actual magical energy themselves. These are what gives pegasi their ability to fly and manipulate the weather and earth ponies their endurance.” Twilight was absolutely ecstatic and could barely suppress her excitement, her new found energy probably had something to do with that. </p><p>“Oookaayy that’s great and all, but how does that help us exactly?” Rainbow was still somewhat cautious towards these floating silver-white streaks hovering through the air. </p><p>“Uuuhh... look just touch them and you’ll understand.” Everypony looked somewhat reluctant. “Trust me, everypony will be fine. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”</p><p>Catching that last remark Rainbow stamped her front hoof and pushed out her chest.</p><p>“I’m not scared of anything! Especially not some floating white cotton candy!”</p><p>Hearing this Pinkie Pie gasped and made a mad dash towards the nearest floating energy and took the sliver of magic entirely into her mouth. Everypony just stood there waiting as Pinkie remained sitting on her rump looking absent mindedly at the space in front of her. </p><p>“Eeh darling are you ok dear?” As soon as Rarity finished asking, Pinkie Pie shot straight up like a rocket, going higher than the tallest nearby tree. Twilight was beginning to worry, perhaps giving somepony like Pinkie magical energy in its purest form might just be a tad too extreme. To her own experience that small sliver of energy made her feel like she drank five cups of coffee, who knows what would happen when somepony like Pinkie took one nearly twice as long. </p><p>Before she could finish her train of thought, Pinkie came back to earth with a resounding:</p><p><b>THUMP!</b></p><p>“Eh Pinkie? You ok there sugarcube?” Applejack was just about to nudge the pink pony when her mane and tail suddenly gave out a <b>POOF</b> as it returned to its original pink bundle of fluff. </p><p>“OhmygoshohmygoshthatwasabsolutelythemostamazingthingI’veevereateninmyentirelife! It tasted like rainbow but instead of being all hot and spicy and stuff it was all sweet and sour and even tangy at the same time I even think I tasted some zap apples there for a minute but then it changed to something like a strawberry covered fudge sundae but instead of it being made out of chocolate it was like cotton candy then all my Pinkie Sense went off almost at the same time which could only mean I’m about to jump really really high which never really happened before now that I think about it but then I remembered that the white cotton candy was still in my mouth so I started chewing it and ooooohhhhh by Celestia it felt so good I thought I was going to cu-mmffp.” </p><p>“Darling please that is not something a lady should openly talk about!” Though Rarity still had her hoof on Pinkie’s mouth, it did not seem to stop her from mumbling about something to herself.</p><p>“That’s what I've been trying to say, we can get back all our energy and stolen magic by touching these things.” Still somewhat reluctant, the rest of the group slowly reached out to touch the nearest slivers of magic, though none tried to actually eat them like Pinkie. </p><p>As each of the mares absorbed the nearby energy all their exhaustion and stress was washed away by the sudden flood of energy and magic. Rainbow immediately flew up high, dashing here to there and was even about to pull off a sonic rainboom before Twilight could stop her. Applejack carefully allowed Fluttershy to touch one with her nose, as she couldn’t even lift a hoof. As she made contact she let out a squeal as her body jerked wildly from the sudden surge of energy which sent Applejack off balanced making them fall sideways.</p><p>“Oh my I’m so sorry Applejack it was just so much I...I didn’t realize what I was doing and my body just reacted by itself. Oh please oh please don’t hate me, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“It’s aright sugarcube ah’m ok, ya just gave me a fright’s all.” Fluttershy immediately calmed down and blushed as she started to hide behind her mane as usual. </p><p>With that done, Applejack and Rarity both also absorbed some energy. Though it was obvious how everypony's mood had changed, Rarity showed the most visible physical change. Even while still covered in mud and leaves, her coat was practically glowing a bright white shine while her mane gave of a shadow of deep purple adding a beautiful contrast. </p><br/><p>“Oh by the stars I look absolutely amazing! I definitely need to get more of this.” With that, she brought out several jars from her saddle back which used to contain provisions and attempted to capture more of the slivers of energy. They merely floated through the glass of the jars as they continued to travel deeper into the woods. </p><p>“Alright girls this shows that we’re getting close to the cause. We can just absorb more of these things whenever you start to get tired. Rarity please, that’s enough. It won’t work and we need to keep moving!” Rarity shook herself free of her broken dreams and returned the jars back into her saddle back with head hung low. They all began galloping towards the same direction as the floating slivers of magic. </p><p>Twilight was right, not even ten minutes after they reached a small clearing. What they saw made all six mares drop their jaws altogether. It was like a miniature sun itself, giving of a bright shining white light. It was the size of an Ursa Minor were it to curl up into a ball, and all around it thousands of the same floating slivers of magic were making their way into the gargantuan mass.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/d23cfeecbcc79921e1e4c50e7d44c21133345b79?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.misconceptionjunction.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F08%2F6a00e5516ef02e88330120a956f215970b.jpg" /></p></div><p>Twilight was the first to come back into her senses as she immediately started to focus a great amount of energy in order to cast the beacon spell. Seeing the lavender unicorn giving off her signature purple glow of magic caused everypony else to snap out of their own trances. </p><p>“Twilight what are you doing?” </p><p>“Rainbow, this is WAY bigger than I ever imagined, we can’t do this by ourselves we need Princess Celestia and Luna immediately! Only they can handle this situation!” Twilight had her eyes closed, fully concentrating on her spell. After a minute with nothing happening, Rarity was beginning to worry. </p><p>“Is everything alright dear?”</p><p>“I *pant* don’t understand, I should have enough magic after absorbing that much energy earlier. WHY…WON’T…IT…” And then it hit her, being this close to the source of the siphon she was losing magic at an increased rate. </p><p>“Aargh! Why didn’t I realize this sooner!” With some quick thinking she moved right in front of a large sliver of magic as it making its way towards the mass. Twilight prepared herself for the sudden influx of energy, hoping it would be enough of a boost to trigger the spell. </p><p>As the sliver comes into contact with the back of Twilight’s head she yelps at the sudden surge of energy. Twilight nearly lost control of the spell but fortunately held her concentration, her eyes glowed brightly as she continue to focus the additional surge of magic into her horn. Her horn which was glowing with Twilight trademark aura suddenly exploded into blinding white light as white fire started to burn at the tip of her horn. The fire suddenly flew up high into the air which exploded forcing everypony to look away. As the light dispersed they looked up and saw a bright flare burning white the size of large luxury carriage. </p><p>&quot;Wow...overkill.&quot; Just as Dash finished her remark, the glow left Twilight. She started to fall sideways, but instead of meeting the dirt, she fell on all her friends who all jumped at the same time trying to catch her. </p><p>“Twilight are you ok, are you hurt? Do you need anything?” Fluttershy was flying around Twilight trying to see if she can find any injuries or burns from the white fire. </p><p>“I’m fine Fluttershy really, everypony it’s ok, I’m just exhausted.” They all let out a breath of relief. Then a sudden flash of light followed by a thundering <b>CRACK</b> signaled the arrival of two alicorns, Princess Celestia and Luna reagents of the sun and moon themselves. </p><p>“Princess!” With the sight of her mentor Twilight felt a surge of energy and galloped towards Celestia who bent over to give her pupil a motherly nuzzle. </p><p>“My dearest Twilight I’m glad that you and everypony here is safe. We were quite surprised to see such a powerful flare burni-” Before she could finish Luna interrupted. </p><p>“Sister!” Celestia looked at Luna who was frozen in fright. Slowly Celestia turned towards what Luna was facing behind her. </p><p>“By creation…” It was all she could muster to say. Not in all of her long, immortal life had she witnessed such a massive collection of magic. Celestia might be the ruler of Equestria, immortal, and controlled the sun itself, but even she didn’t have access to anywhere near the same level of concentrated magic gathered before her. This amount of magic would easily spark the creation of a sun and still have some left to spare. </p><br/><p>But then she noticed something off, at first it felt like a small nudge in the back of her mind. She started to focused on this odd sensation and slowly it became clearer. It grew in strength as the small sensation slowly became more sound than feeling. Increasing in volume, it sounded so familiar yet she couldn’t quite seem to put her hoof on it.</p><p>“What is...no...that's impossible!”</p><p>“Sister what is it?” Luna was frantic and trying to find some guidance from her elder sister. </p><p>“Concentrate on the center of the mass of energy and listen.” With that Luna closed her eyes and did what her sister bid. </p><p>“By the Gates of Tartarus! Is that…is that a heart beat?” </p><p>“I believe so Luna, there’s something alive in there causing all this.”</p><p>“If it is in fact alive, how do we stop it without…” Luna was prepared to do anything to save the kingdom, but she did not expect to take a life. </p><p>“I’m afraid we have no choice, we have to stop this before it gets further out of hoof.” Celestia turned towards the elements of harmony. “All of you stand back as far as possible.” Twilight, however, standing next to Celestia overhead the conversation and hugged her mentor’s leg to grab her attention. </p><p>“Princess you can’t do that, harming whatever's inside it might accidentally cause the all collected magic to backlash out into the world. That much magic flowing out to the world could wipe out everypony!” Celestia mentally slapped herself for not considering such a devastating outcome. However if the cause of this phenomena is in fact alive, then there might yet be a chance to save everypony.</p><p>“Luna we’re using the chains!” Luna was baffled at what Celestia was suggesting. </p><p>“Sister those are meant for Discord himself! How could we use them on somepony we know nothing about!”</p><p>“We don’t have a choice, quickly take your place on the opposite side.” </p><p>With some hesitation Luna flew over the concentration of magic, carefully dodging and avoiding all the slivers of energy in the air and landed on the opposite side of the clearing. </p><p>“Sister I am ready!” She shouted. </p><p>“Focus! It's crucial that we do this exactly in the same instant!” Closing her eyes, Celestia began blocking out all the distractions around her. The sound of rustling winds, the heavy breathing of the Elements nearby, everything started to ebb away. Only that shadow, that figure floating in the center of the raging storm mattered. </p><p>&quot;Now!!&quot; shouted Celestia.  In an instant both alicorn's horn exploded with their respective glows as a swirl of sunlight concentrated in front of Celestia while a dark shadow formed next to Luna. As their spells reached their peak, chains of deep dark blue and bright white shot from both portals towards the center mass of the magic. As the chains flew the mass of magic started to bend away like opposing magnets. Like a spear they pierced onwards forming what looked like a tunnel of swirling light. </p><p>As the chains closed in that shadowy figure soon turned to a clear silhouette. For the briefest moment Celestia saw that the creature's physical trait, she suspected it was not a pony but what she saw was completely alien. It looked bipedal and more akin to an ape than anything else. But before she could contemplate any further the chains clasp on a pair of limbs on its side.  </p><p>As the chains continue to wrap around the creature Celestia felt Luna's thoughts prod her mind. <i>'Tis not working Sister!'</i></p><p><i>'Stay calm Luna, we must not frighten the creature.'</i> Like Luna, Celestia began projecting her own thoughts towards the creature. Hopefully this creature is intelligent or things just got very complicated. </p><p><i>‘Can you hear me? Can you understand me?’</i> Both alicorns waited nervously, hoping to sense some form of intelligent thought. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><i>‘………Yes’ </i></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Relief flowed though the Princesses as their chances of success skyrocketed. </p><p><i>‘Listen very well, you have drawn a dangerous amount of magic unto yourself. You must release this energy or it will destroy both you and our world.’</i> They waited for a moment waiting something to happen. Suddenly the collection of energy started to expand outwards rapidly. </p><p><i>‘NO! STOP! Do not mindlessly release it without will. It will shock and kill out all life! Slowly form and mold the energy into something that can easily travel across the world while releasing it back into the world.’</i> Again they waited, hoping that the creature would not accidentally destroy the world by mistake. </p><p>The collection of energy slowly started to shake violently. For a moment Celestia believed that they had failed and the mass of energy was about to explode across the land. But then it shrunk, it was ever so slow but it kept on shrinking and starting to gather atop of the creature. This went on for several minutes as the mass continued to condense into a smaller scale which grew brighter as it shrunk. </p><p>The smaller mass started to shake again as it refused to shrink any further. Before Celestia could advise the creature any further, the mass of energy shot through the sky, engulfing the land in light as if a second sun was rising. It kept on going and going even further, Celestia feared that the creature had chosen to banish all that magic away from their world. Her thoughts were interrupted however when a bright flash of light exploded above. As her eyes adjusted she could see smaller pieces of the mass start to spread across the sky in different directions, like an over-sized firework. As they focused their gaze ever further they saw each chunk of energy started to break apart slowly. Then Celestia realized what the creature had done. Like a meteorite entering the atmosphere, each chunk was breaking bit by bit as they slowly travelled across the land, releasing the energy in a controlled flow. It was beautiful, not even during Luna’s greatest reign has she ever created such a sight across the black canvass of the cosmos. </p><br/><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/44befb01b51f87c84b1f1eee25ca9af6d4556feb?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc09.deviantart.net%2Ffs21%2Ff%2F2007%2F286%2Fe%2F0%2FMeteor_Shower_by_the_panpiper.jpg" /></p><br/><br/><p>With the knowledge that Equestria was safe both Celestia and Luna severed the chains letting them fall to the ground still attached to the creature. With a mild headache both Princesses collected themselves and cast a minor spell to alleviate their pain. </p><p>“Princess!” Twilight was galloping toward her mentor, followed by the rest of the elements.</p><p>“Twilight I’m glad everypony is safe. Don’t worry about us, other than a slight headache we too are unharmed.” Luna landed next to Celestia and the girls huddled around them both, finally relieved that the threat is over. </p><p>Before long they noticed small glimmers in the sky. At first Twilight thought it was just the stars at night but then her jaw dropped for the second time today as well as everypony else’s. It was like snow as they fell slowly to the ground but much slower which gave them a beautiful sway in the air. They appeared to be made out of crystal, yet it constantly deformed as if made out of liquid as well. But what struck them the most were the colors, each crystal that fell gave of a dim glow of colors which shifted across the many spectra of light. </p><p>As one slowly fell upon the group they felt it all together. It was warm and it penetrated through their body, like drinking hot chocolate in the cold. It was the magic returning to everypony and the planet itself. Both Princesses and the elements of harmony could only stand still as they marveled at the sight and felt every warmth that each crystal gave off near them. They would’ve stayed there stuck in their trances in utter silence were it not for the small cough that they heard behind them. It was barely a whisper but in the deep absolute silence it went across as easily as thunder would. </p><p>Slowly each head turned to look at the creature, it was clearly still alive as its chest rose up and down as it continue to breath. With a closer look Celestia was correct in her earlier assumption, the creature was definitely bipedal and ape like but with considerably less fur. It has four limbs two of each were made to walk based on their design, as her eyes drifted to its other limbs she saw digits similar to a dragon’s except it had five of them and looked soft with smoothed ends instead of scales and sharp claws. But what stood out the most was what was attached to them, near the ends of each ‘clawed’ limb are metal cuffs with several links of chain, each cuff and chain was drastically different from the other. One was deep black ebony with small bits of crystal-like dust embedded inside which shimmered in the light, giving of a beautiful imitation of the night sky. The other was pure white and instead of reflecting light it broke them up to rainbow colors the same way glass prisms do. Finally, each cuff was stamped with the symbol of a reagent, a crescent moon on ebony on the left limb, and a symbol of the sun on the right. Both were an exact copy of Celestia’s and Luna’s cutie mark. </p><p>Slowly, the creature began to stir. The elements fearfully took a step back as Luna and Celestia remained still where they were. Slowly Celestia came closer and bent down until her face was directly in front of the creature’s face. Again the creature began to rouse and slowly open its eyes. It blinked several more times and continued to look into Celestia’s eyes, then it spoke.</p><br/><br/><br/><p>“Dafuq!?”  </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Author’s Notes: Holy crap this was long, I never really intended for it to be 4k plus words. If you made it all the way down here then give yourself a pat on the back because you survived through all the crap that is an amateur’s work. No seriously, if you haven’t read any of my notes yet this is my first ever attempt to write a story. No prior experience at all, I just randomly decided to make one seeing as how I enjoyed all the other amazing fanfics. </p><br/><p>Anyways here’s the plan for this fic, it’ll be mostly shenanigans and comedy with a bit of romance probably. I was entertaining the ideas of including clop bits, but since this is my first try I probably should take it easy. You never know, I might be good at it. It won’t all be sunshine and rainbows though, I’ll throw in somewhat small adventures here and there, like story arcs but nothing too big. Definitely each such arc with be less than 10 chapters. </p><p>Also please comment and criticize the shit out of this, I need as much feedback as I can. Remember don’t hold back. <br/>Now I’ll admit a few things, Pinkie Pie scares the crap out of me. I don’t know if you noticed but I avoided writing Pinkie into the script as much as possible, I just don’t really know how to pull her off. Please tell me if it worked or not.</p><br/><p>Pie: Oh you’re such a worry wort, I think you did me just great!<br/>Me: … DAFUQ IS THIS!?</p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.5em">﻿</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 2 - The good stuff<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><p><i>AN: From this point on the story will be written from the main character's perspective.</i></p><hr/><p>&quot;Dafuq!?&quot;</p><p><i>'Sooo I'm either alive, dead, or I smoked the good shit. And considering what the other two implies, let’s go with being high.'</i></p><p>&quot;Who are you? Can you understand me?&quot; Oh god it talks.</p><p><i>'..........YUP, definitely high. Well there's only one way to deal with this.'</i> I reached out to it and <b>SLAP</b>, right on its face. You might be wondering what prompted that decision, most people would start pinching themselves in hopes of returning to reality. But where’s the fun in that? In my mind, whenever you're lucky enough to get so high and jacked up to be seeing a talking white unicorn with a flowing multi-colored mane, I say roll with it and have as much fun possible while it lasts. </p><p>Before I could notice the odd sensation on my wrists, I was distracted by several stutters and gasps next to me. I turned to the source of the sounds only to find more horses, most of them were smaller and brightly colored. One of them even had a mane like a rainbow and wings.</p><p><i>'A pegasus too? Damn, I must've lucked out and got the high quality stuff. I gotta remember that dealer the nex-'</i></p><p><b>&quot;HOW DARE THOU HARM OUR SISTER!&quot;</b> Holy shit, I thought something exploded next to me! I saw the black one point at me with her horn, it began glowing before a deep blue light shot from the tip and came flying straight at me. Naturally, with reflexes of a little girl, I shut my eyes and raised my arms over my face in a pitiable attempt to block the projectile. The initial surprise caused me to forget I was hallucinating, so for a moment I had expected to feel a few things, pain, pressure or force, instead I felt nothing. </p><p><i>'The hell?'</i></p><p>I opened my eyes, only to see even more light missiles coming my way. I closed my eyes again bracing for the impact, when again, nothing happened. Tentatively I opened my eyes for the third time just in time to see one fly under my outstretched arms and hit my chest dead center. I readied myself for any type of pain from impact or puncture to possible burns, yet the projectile of light simply wink out of existence once it made contact and after several tense seconds I felt nothing. </p><p><i>'SHIT! I nearly pissed myself! How deep in wonder-fucking-land am I?'</i></p><p><b>&quot;WHAT ART THOU? WHY DOTH ALL OUR SPELLS NOT AFFECT THEE?&quot;</b> </p><p>&quot;Luna that is enough! And control your voice, please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;BUT SIS-but sister! That...<i>thing</i> has struck thee across thy face. It needs to be punished!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Considering the situation it could have acted out of surprise or fear. Please Luna, calm yourself.&quot; I didn’t know whether to be afraid or impressed. Her voice carried a heavy amount of authority and strength, yet still felt calm and caring. </p><p><i>'Definitely the motherly type, better not to mess with this one too much'</i> I know from personal experience they’re the most unstable kind when it comes with their loved ones, that probably makes it a 'her'. <i>'Yea let's not screw around with any of them with her around. Otherwise shit could go really bad, really fast.</i> Just because you're aware that you're dreaming or hallucinating doesn't mean you have it totally under control. She turned and looked straight at me. </p><p>&quot;Let's start again shall we, can you understand me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...uh...yes?&quot; I could tell that the smaller horses was surprised at my response as their ears perked up and their eyes widened, which by the way were huge! </p><p>&quot;Very good, now how do you feel? Are you injured?&quot; I doubt any hallucination can hurt me, at most I'll probably end up with a headache once the weed wears off. Still, the question made me focus on my senses for anything out of the ordinary, which made me notice that my arms, or more accurately my wrists, felt heavier. I looked and saw that both my arms were cuffed with the strangest type of metal I've ever seen, with several links of chain hanging from each cuff. The one on my left was black ebony marked by the moon and the other was shining white marked by the sun. </p><p><i>'Careful now, this can either go really bad or really, really, kinky bad.'</i> Sorry, but I just don't swing that way, pain is pain in my book. I imagined waking up in some barn chained up to a wall surrounded by horses, and considering my past experiences when smoking a joint, it was a very real possibility. So yea, I was starting to get <i>very</i> afraid, which probably showed on my face because she then spoke in a very caring and gentle manner.</p><p>&quot;Forgive us, but we had no choice but to use them considering the circumstances. It was the only way we could prevent total destruction while still allowing you to keep your life.&quot; Honestly, I had no idea what she was talking about, I'm getting nothing but blanks in my memory before I woke up. The last thing I remembered was returning home from after getting more weed. Looking back to the cuffs I noticed they weren't uncomfortable at all. In fact, if they were just a little lighter, I might not have registered them being there at all. </p><p>I slowly rose to my feet, the chains on my new accessories jingling from my movement. Seeing this, the white unicorn took a step back to give me room, while the smaller horses took one more out of fear. I’ve been sitting on my ass so far which made me roughly as tall as the small ones making me look less intimidating. They probably didn't expect me to stand on my legs or tower over them, my attire didn't help make me look harmless either. I was wearing mostly black with a hoodie that had a heavy-metal theme going on, complete with giant burning skull. It's not my normal clothes mind you, these were only the stuff I wore whenever I travelled about the shadier parts of the city. And with my current situation as proof, it’s the only place to get the really high quality goods.  </p><p>I looked back to the white unicorn, she was still taller than me but only by one or two inches, not counting the spear like horn atop her head. <i>'All the more reason to play it safe.'</i> Another thing I missed was that in addition to her horn, she also had feathered wings folded on her sides. </p><p><i>'The hell does that make her? A pegacorn?'</i></p><p>&quot;I am Princess Celestia,&quot;</p><p><i>'Great, she's royalty.'</i></p><p>&quot;and what might I call you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's, eh, Rodney.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, Rodney, let me introduce you to my sister, this is Princess Luna.&quot; She nudged her head towards Miss Scream-a-lot.</p><p><i>'Woopty-fucking-doo, another one and she’s already pissed at me.'</i></p><p>&quot;Listen Rodney, I must ask you to come with us back to Canterlot.&quot;</p><p><i>'*snort* Canterlot?</i> </p><p>&quot;As leader <i>and</i> protector I must determine whether or not you are a threat to my little ponies.&quot; Although it was still gentle, the sense of caring from before was gone, it was entirely filled with authority. So far I just kept going with the flow, so I nodded and she led me to the rest of the group. While the smaller ones, ponies was it?, were eyeing me with a mix of fear and curiosity, especially the purple one <i>'is she licking her lips?</i> Luna though was looking at me with venom in her eyes and was always walking in a way as if I was about to jump and rape someone. Now that I got a good look she was similar to Celestia having both a horn and wings. She was also wearing a tiara though this one was dark blue instead of gold like Celestia's. Now that I was being surrounded by them, I noticed they had some very peculiar marks on their ass. Celestia and Luna's were the sun and moon respectively, upon closer inspection it was the exact mark that was etched into each cuff on my arms. Each of the other ponies also had a mark which varies from stars, to thunderclouds shooting rainbow lightning, and even balloons. </p><p><i>'Shit I better not wake up with any of them tattooed on my ass.'</i> I felt cold shivers run down my back when I saw one yellow pony with pink mane and a butterfly mark which made me imagine having a tramp stamp at the end of my spine. </p><p>What's starting to bug me was how everything was so clear. Even if I was just mildly high, I knew from long years of personal experience that my mind shouldn't be this lucid. I was unable to come up with any theories though as my thoughts just ended up thinking back to the situations I'll wake up to. Each one weirder and more disturbing than the last and all involving horses. </p><p><i>'Better end this shit early before I end up naked in a petting zoo and getting jail time for streaking and psychologically scarring little school girls.'</i> Course how I go about doing so was the question, I'll probably try pinching myself or holding my breath like trying to wake up from a dream. Hell if nothing works I'll piss my pants, it'll be embarrassing but thinking back to all the possible situations I might end up waking to, it was worth it.</p><p><i>'But before I go...'</i> I was really getting pissed how Luna had been constantly looking back and glaring at me, shooting me looks that said she wished I’d just drop dead. </p><p><i>'Definitely gonna have to do something about that.'</i> So I waited until she wasn't looking, raised my hand, and slapped hard on her flank. </p><p>Imagine a heavy industry sledgehammer, place said hammer into a cannon, load it up with enough explosives to level an entire city block, and aim it straight at your balls. That would have been preferable. There was so much pain I hardly registered what I was doing, I was probably weeping like a whipped puppy from the raging inferno in between my legs. This was a pain no living male of any species should have to suffer through. It seems my brain had agreed and offered me some mercy, and so I passed out.</p><p>So there I was, crying and curled up in a fetal position on the ground with both my hands nursing my balls in front of six mares and two princesses. Not the best way to start my new life. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: I actually had a really hard time trying to end this chapter with the same level of humor as last one. You would think that slapping Luna on her flank would give me a hordefull of ideas but noooo I'm drawing blank. I've also started to write in Rodney's perspective because I enjoy writing his thoughts and it helps express things easier.</p><br/><p>Again I edited this on my own so there's bound to be a lot of mistakes so which is why I welcome all C&amp;Cs so please do so. Also, point out any words that I forgot to ponify, like somebody to somepony.</p><br/><p>Sorry but I tried really hard looking through the web, but I still couldn't find a pic of Luna rear kicking someone in the groin. Ask Pinkie.</p><br/><p>Pinkie: Yup! He really did, though he suddenly ended up real interested in some socks tha-</p><br/><p>OK ENOUGH OF THAT! Let’s start writing the next chapter shall we!</p><br/><p>Pinkie: *giggle* Oki doki loki!</p>

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 3 - Mine does magic.</p><p>AN: Shout out to <a href="/user/Furstreak" rel="nofollow">Furstreak </a>, I've read a lot of fic before but his work was what finally pushed me to write. Here's the <a href="/story/21513/Whats-love-got-to-do-with-it%3F" rel="nofollow">link </a>to his story, and thanks man so far I'm having a blast doing this!</p><hr/><p><i>'Ooohhh sweet baby Jesus...my balls! Uuurrrrgghhhh...'</i> pain was the first thing that greeted me when I came to. Once my senses came back to life the first thing I registered was the smell of disinfectant, I opened my eyes and had to squint against the glaring light. Once my eyes adjusted I all I saw was white, the room I was in was completely covered in white which reflected the light to every nook. There were wires attached to my chest and other parts of my body, I had expected to see them connect to some medical equipment like a heart monitor but looking around I there was nothing, the room was completely barren except for the bed I'm resting on. I followed the wires which traveled across the room and through a door which was right next to a large mirror on the wall.</p><p><i>'Oh fuck me sideways I'm in an interrogation room! What the hell did I do this time!?'</i> I started to imagine all the things my dumb ass would've done while high to get me landed in such a place. I imagined breaking into a government safe-house, witnessing the government assassinate someone  or even acidently ending up in Area51, all somehow involving horses, <i>'maybe alien horses?'</i> As I began moving about the bed I heard a familiar sound of metal hitting metal on my arms. Again I barely felt it, though it was clear as they and definitely made durable material. The fact that I was still wearing the same odd pair of metal cuffs on my arms from my hallucinations which was tied to the wall behind me by the chains nearly threw my into a panic attack. </p><p><i>'...am I still high?'</i> that can't be, as strong as the stuff was it couldn't have lasted this long plus the constant throbbing pain of my family jewels eliminates any chances of me dreaming. <i>'Nah nah that can't be right, yea this is all just one big fucking fluke. Its just by chance that this this place has me bound by the same exact pair of cuffs that I dreamed about, made from the same weird metal and has the same exact marks.'</i> </p><p>........................................................and I broke.</p><p><i>'FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-'</i> let's just skip this part shall we, its embarrassing and it took me a while to get over. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><i>'Oh god talking ponies! Oh god I slapped them! OH GOD imma get probed!!'</i> nope still at it, keep moving.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>I closed my eyes, took some very needed deep breaths and was just barely able to stop my next panic attack. While I was in my little happy place I started to feel something nudging me in the back of mind. It didn't feel like anything's physically wrong with me, except for the two smoking embers that used to be my genitals, but it also felt strangely familiar. </p><p>I started to focus more on this odd sensation fearing its my brain telling me there's something wrong with me internally, instead the sensation became more of a feeling. It was like standing by a bonfire and feeling the radiating heat, and this 'fire' was moving. Initially I felt it in front of me but then it started to move towards the left. It stopped at one point and just stood still, for a moment nothing changed but then I noticed that the 'heat' from the 'fire' was getting more intense. </p><p><i>'Funny, its like its getting clo....oh shit.</i> I'm not exactly sure why I thought so but nevertheless I threw my head back to the pillow and pretended to be asleep. I continue to lay there breathing at a tempo as I continue to focus on that peculiar sense. Based on the 'heat' I was quite sure that whatever it is was right behind the glass. Then it started moving again and I heard the door open.</p><p>Although I only felt one 'fire', based on the footsteps several people had come into the room, all wearing heels or something. I had to concentrate harder to keep my breathing rhythmic and calm as the footsteps continue to approach me. It stopped right next to the bedside and I began to wonder why I'm not feeling any pain despite the intense 'heat', the 'fire' was so close I could imagine myself reaching out and touching it. Right at that moment the 'fire' suddenly lunged at me, I flinched and anyone who was looking could easily see through my deception. Instead hearing someone's voice I heard a <b>THUD!</b> next to me. After several intense seconds of hearing nothing I couldn't handle the tension and I slowly cracked my eyes open as small as possible, just enough to look around. </p><p>As much as I tried I couldn't spot anything different from what little I saw, seeing and hearing nobody I decided it was relatively safe slowly opened my eyes fully. I was confident nothing looked different from before, which was easy to tell considering I have a clear view and there was barely nothing in the room at all.</p><p><i>'So then where...'</i> I looked over the bed expecting to see someone in a white lab coat, well at least I got the white part right. It was definitely not a human but equine, it reminded me of the six ponies from before but I've never seen this one. It <i>'or she I guess,'</i> had a tail and main which was tied to a bun while wearing a nurses's cap and a coat which was as white as the floor tiles with the exception of a red cross on its ass, <i>again with the tattoos?</i> She was sprayed across the floor and wasn't moving, before I thought I had somehow killed it I noticed the rhythmic rise and fall of the chest which indicated that she's probably just unconscious. As I looked I can still feel the same 'fire' as before but it had been greatly diminished to a candle in comparison. And then the nature of the situation hit me, here I am chained up to a bed with wires going to god knows where, locked in a high security room with one of the staff lying on the floor next to me unconscious. </p><p><i>'*clap, clap, clap* WAY to go Rodney! Your balls are screaming in pain and your also strapped up by chains in some freaky ass room straight from the X-Files about to get probed! And yet you still find a way to screw it up even more! Without even opening you big ass mouth for once! How can it possibly get wo...........ah fuck my life.'</i> during my little episode I failed to notice two more 'fires' had entered the room behind the mirror. I heard the door burst opened and there stood two more ponies dressed in armor, both scowling faces that says: <i>Imma bout to whoop your ass boy!</i> They looked identical from one another and they had different body proportion than the one lying next to me, it looked more built and muscular which probably made them males.</p><p>&quot;Ok, I know this looks <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">REALLY </span>bad but I swear I had nothing to do with-&quot; I was raising my arms up to show I had nothing with me, but the idiot on the right must have thought I was about to do something because he made a mad dash towards me with murder in his eyes. </p><p>&quot;NONONONONOWAIT!&quot; but he wasn't listening and was already next to the bed with one of his front hooves raised back, poised to strike me. Luckily this guy decided to make this a physical confrontation which I had quite a lot of experience in. By reflex I raised my left arm ready to deflect the attack and my right arm was already guarding both my body and face in case I missed. I resisted the urge to close my eyes and focused at his hoof as started to make its way to my face, or so I thought. Suddenly his body shifted and his eyes went down the bed and locked onto his target, right between my legs. For a moment I thought I could feel my dick retreating inside my body, leaving it's two companions to their fate.</p><p><i>'OH DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!!'</i> the thought of someone else about to murder my boys prompted a sudden urge of dread. Even though I tried to reach out with both my hands to stop him I knew the chains would prevent me from ever getting close, and the small bed I was in severely limited my movement which made dodging the the blow unlikely. </p><p>They say that in life threatening moment's things slow down because your brain tarted overclocking, taking in and processing everything from your senses. Well this must've been damn close to dying because I could see, hear and feel everything as the guillotine was slowly falling down towards my nuts.</p><p>By this point I felt my body was burning with heat all over which started to flow and gather down below where I felt it burst into the same 'fire' I had sense from the nurse. Just barely before the hoof came into contact the 'fire' exploded outwards and I saw an azure blob of light flew from my groin and hit the guard right under his chest. He flew backwards straight to the mirror which broke upon impact sending both pony and glass falling and shattering to the room behind. </p><p>And that ladies and gentleman was how I not only became the first human to use magic, but I was also the first do it from my dick. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/b3b84fc33e7a51006a40179920b859ff1eb5dcee?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc02.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2012%2F219%2F5%2Fc%2Fcustom_xbox_achievement___1__by_noxxels-d5a5831.jpg" /></p></div><p>What followed after the sound of breaking glass was dead silence as both the remaining guard and myself was trying to make sense what had just occurred. The guard being trained came to his sense before I did and like his partner suddenly made his way towards me. I though I needed to defend myself again but he suddenly dipped and slid across the floor towards the nurse and quickly dragged her back into the other room, all the while looking at me with both malice and fear. I heard some shuffling and more glass breaking before I saw the same guard running out the room carrying both the nurse and his companion on his back. </p><p>Before I could start figuring out what I had just done I heard shouting from the door the guard went through which lead to a hallway of sorts. The shouting intensified when more voices joined the fray. Trying to find some control over the situation I concentrated on my new 'sixth sense'. I felt far larger numbers of 'fire' starting to approach my room at a rapid pace, one of those 'fires' was burning stronger than the others. I began pulling on the chains in hopes of breaking them of the wall even though I knew it was probably a futile effort. All I could do was wait and face the music as the sound of footsteps and clanging metal along with the 'fires' kept coming closer and stronger.</p><p>Eventually large numbers of guards wearing the same armor began flooding into the other room, several took careful steps to avoid the broken glass. They entered the room I was in slowly and with constant vigilance, they made their way to fill the room and surrounded me in a large U shape. Through it all I had my arms up against the wall behind me with my chains wrapped around my arm which further restricted my movements and looking as intimidating as possible, hell I even threw in a smile. I thought about trying to use whatever it was I did earlier but I couldn't make that same 'fire' as before. Even if I did I doubt I could beat them all if they decided to come at me all at once. One of the stepped forward, he was a unicorn with white fur and his mane and tail was of different shades of blue. He was also wearing a different set of armor from the rest making it obvious he was had a different rank than the others. </p><p>&quot;Monster!&quot;</p><p><i>'Ouch'</i></p><p>&quot;You have have not only attacked one of my men but a citizen as well! Had they suffered severe injuries or worse I would have ended you life here and now despite my orders!&quot;</p><p><i>'The want me alive? Oh thank you sweet Fate, I...'</i></p><p>&quot;The Princesses are on their way to determine your fate.&quot;</p><p><i>'...hate you so much.'</i></p><p>He just stood there looking at me and I at him and it eventually became a staring contest. Tried as I might this guy was tough and I gave in after my eye started to twitch in annoyance. I saw a small smirk on his face at his victory, <i>'bastard.'</i> With nothing to do but wait I decided to prepare myself for the inevitable confrontation I started to formulate a plan and went through several deep breaths to calm myself. This brought back my new sixth sense as I started to feel the 'fires' around me again and noticed that the one that just spoke was the one with the larger 'fire' I sensed earlier. </p><p><i>'Does that mean hes tougher? Younger? Older? Maybe he has a bigger dick. Could indicate his rank but that makes no sense.'</i> Whatever the reason he is definitely on a different level than the rest.  </p><p>Finally having some time to myself, relatively speaking, I tried to wrap my head around the events that lead up to this point. I tried to remember anything from my memory before all this to see if I can remember what I did or what happened, I got nothing after smoking the joint I just got. What is this thing I've been feeling, it's like I can tell where they are by just 'feeling' them. And what happened to the nurse, why'd she fall unconscious and why did her 'fire' jumped at me like that? But the biggest brain fuck of them all was, <i>'Since when the hell am I able to shoot lasers out of my dick!?'</i></p><p>Before I could come up with any answers or theories, a flash of light appeared at the bottom of the bed in front of me followed by a small cracking sound. An instant later I saw the same two pegacorns from before, Princess Celestia and Princess Ball Breaker. My right eye began to twitch as memories of the pain came flooding back, hell I felt my balls tingle which probably meant their shaking in fear. </p><p>The tension in the air was suffocating me, everything I planned for this confrontation just went up in flames and I was starting to have another panic attack. Though Celestia was looking at me with an flat face, Luna however was clearly wishing she could kick my nether regions a second time. My began to hyperventilate and was sweating all over, when I saw Celestia about to declare my death, or worse to commence the probing, it brought down the walls. </p><p>&quot;Sorry-I-slapped-you-and-your-sister-on-her-ass-I-thought-I-was-hallucinating-from-the-joint-I-had-smoked-so-I-thought-it-wouldn't-hurt-to-screw-around-with-what-I-thought-was-figments-of-my-imagination!&quot; it all came out like one long word. I saw Luna's expression changed to one of surprise which quickly reverted back into anger, though I noticed a small tinge of red appear on her cheeks. A small smile spread across Celestia's face at my sudden outburst but also quickly reverted to her neutral expression.</p><p>&quot;That is another matter to discuss at another time <i>and</i> without an audience. For now I wish to hear why you have decided to assault two of our subjects. Well Rodney?&quot; it was a calm and neutral voice but it was void of anything which also reflected on her face. Luna's expression was a raging fire storm and yet I still found it to be more comforting than Celestia's.</p><p>&quot;And do not dare to lie to us! If we detect anything remotely close to a forked tongue we will inflict upon thee pain far worse than before.&quot; I felt the tingle in between my legs grow stronger.  </p><p>I decided to go through this as calm as possible, breaking down in front of those two would only create more problems. With more deep breaths and a small trip to my happy place I began telling them everything. I laid everything bare, holding nothing back. I explained how I'm just as confused and lost with no knowledge to how I ended in the forest where we first met. How I thought everything was merely my own weird hallucinations as I've never seen talking ponies. I also told them everything about the the nurse and the guard though I kept it somewhat civil, who knows how they would react if they heard I could throw a full grown pony wearing armor through fortified glass with nothing more than my reproductive organ. </p><p>&quot;If what your telling us is true, that it would appear that you are merely a victim of circumstance. Even though you have caused fear to spread to my little ponies and nearly destroying all life. You are, nevertheless, still a victim.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh thank you I...wait...I nearly did WHAT!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It looks like my thoughts were correct, you were not aware of your actions, do not worry that is in all in the past. Rodney I have decided not to press charges and forgive you for everything as it would seem they were all unintentional or accidental.&quot;</p><p><i>'Finally someone who isn't trying to kill me.'</i></p><p>&quot;However.&quot;</p><p><i>'Ah fuck.'</i></p><p>&quot;Just because you have no intentions to harm anypony we must still determine whether or not you are dangerous to my subjects. Based on your own words you have little to no control whatsoever in handling magic.&quot;</p><p><i>'Wait.............................................................................what?'</i></p><p>&quot;Thus until I say otherwise you are to remain here under the care  and supervision of my student. She will help you in uncovering the secret behind your abilities as well as train you as well. Until she, Luna and I are convince you are able to keep your powers in check, you <i>will</i> remain in this castle.&quot; the tone in her voice meant this was not up for debate, and honestly as long as no one makes anymore assassination attempts to my junk its all fine and gravy. &quot;Do you have any questions to ask us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, is this real?&quot; looking at Celetia's reaction she must not have expected the question to come out so simple.  </p><p>&quot;Yes I'm afraid so. I have suspected that you came not from a remote part of the world, but from a different world entirely. I have already sent several teams of unicorns to the site where we found you but initial reports indicate it is unlikely they will find anything. With no clue to where or how you arrived in Equestria sending you back is.....impossible.&quot; I could feel the love and tenderness in her voice but I was surprised to hear pain as well.</p><p><i>'You actually feel sorry for me don't you?'</i> well can't do much about it then. I was never one to cry over spilled milk, I've learned it useless to worry and be angry at something that's completely out of control. <i>'Shit happens, and I just stepped on the mother of them all.'</i> Still I the thought of not returning home, not seeing my parents, and never able to punch my boss's teeth out was getting to me. I just wanted to lay down and close my eyes, but I still had one more thing bugging me.</p><p>&quot;Princess, when the guard I knocked out attacked me, why did he aim between my legs?&quot; thinking it over even if they've never seen a human before the face or center mass would have been logical choices. Celestia turned and looked at Luna.</p><p>&quot;Based on our what hath occurred we discovered that although thou appear to be unaffected by our magic, physical approach however appear to be very effective to thee.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That does not explain why he would target my genitals.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thou'st what!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My genitals, you know, that part of a male that contains two <i>extremely</i> sensitive body parts. Often called one's penis, dick, junk, balls, family jewels,&quot;</p><p>&quot;<b>WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE!</b>&quot; her shout nearly blew my head off.</p><p>&quot;Luna, your voice.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Sister we...but he...sister we did not... He slapped my flank!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You crushed my junk!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Celestia did not enjoy hearing her sister having a conversation about my dick. &quot;Forgive us Rodney, but after seeing as how Luna's reflexes was...efficient. She informed the guard that should they meet any hostility from you, they would know how to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Destroy my hopes and dreams of ever being a father?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do please forgive us, we did not know that your kind have the same, eh, organ placement as ponies do.&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;It's fine, you didn't know. But please no more attempts at making me sterile.&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;You have my word Rodney. Is there anything else you wish to know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, not yet anyways. I just...I need to think.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand, rest for now. I will prepare a suitable living arrangement for you in one of our guest rooms. Please feel free to inform the guard of anything you need.&quot; I nodded and both Celestia and Luna started to make their way out the room. Celestia however stopped and looked at me, &quot;One other thing Rodney, we know what your name is but what do you call your kind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm a homo sapien, or just human if your feeling lazy.&quot; she gave a humored smile at my response, turned and spoke something to Luna and they both looked at me.</p><p>&quot;Well then Rodney the human,&quot; her horn as well as Luna's started to glow and I saw the chains glow in the same fashion. Slowly I saw each link of the chains start to disappearing, moving its way from the wall to my cuffs until only a few were left to dangle about. I looked at her, &quot;welcome to Equestria.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: OMG I never expected to write so much about a man's groin before! Hell I was starting to run out of ideas on what to call them. This one was a bit longer than I expected but like I said before I like to get the ball rolling. </p><p>As usual I want to get as much feedback as possible so hit me with as much C&amp;C as possible. </p><br/><p>You ok there Pinkie?</p><p>Pinkie: I just can't wait to throw a 'Welcome to Equestria and thank you for not blowing it up' party for Rodney, its gonna be just super duper awesome! When can I see him again?</p><p>Don't worry you see him soon.</p><p>Pinkie: Ooooooh that means I get to throw your's right now. I've been dying to show you my PARTY CANNON!</p><p>WAIT PINKIE NOT IN MY <b>BOOOOOM!</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.5em">﻿</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 4 - The song of my people<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><p>AN: I didn't spend as much time editing this as I should have, so please forgive me if you find it to be lacking in quality. I would appreciate it if you guys can point out any mistakes. </p><hr/><p>I tried to sleep but my mind kept thinking about home. Between the heartache and the fear, my hope of possibly of getting any sleep was just not there. I was still in the interrogation room and there was nothing that showed the passage of time so I didn't know how long I just laid there on the bed. I was still hoping this was all a dream, that somehow after smoking a joint I did something stupid and gotten brain damage or something. But seeing as I'm still in the same bed, wearing the same pair of metal cuffs and the fact that there were two ponies standing guard by the door proved I was still fucked. </p><p><i>'God tell me I'm actually in some mental asylum, jacked up on meds and dreaming all this shit. Cause that would mean I could still wake up at one point.'</i> But even if that was the case there's really nothing I could do about it. I needed something to distract me from my morbid thoughts and my stomach happily complied. It was quite a deep growl, not anything impressive, but being in a large room in utter silence made it sound louder than it actually was. One of the guards flinched just the tiniest bit at the sound. He probably just realized he's stuck on duty guarding an unknown creature which towered over him in size and had just announced it had an empty stomach. </p><p>I was entertaining the idea of messing with their heads, but considering that I'm still technically a prisoner, it's best not to, <i>'at least not now.'</i> My stomach sent another complaint and I realized just how hungry I was. Considering that I hadn't eaten anything since I got here I'm surprised I hadn't tried to eat one of them in my sleep. </p><p>&quot;Hey, is it ok if I get something to eat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll inform the staff, however the princess has ordered us to escort you to the guest room that has been prepared. Your food will be brought there, would you like to order anything in particular?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about steak and eggs?&quot; Yea I know it's not the healthiest breakfast, but considering what I've been through a healthy diet is the last thing I'm worried about.</p><p>&quot;You eat...meat?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yea what abou....&quot; I was somewhat confused by the question until I realized that ponies were herbivores. &quot;Ah sonnavabitch!&quot; It dawned on me that if the master race of this world were all vegetarians, then finding meat would be near impossible. Hell, for all I knew it was probably against the law or something to own meat.</p><p>I sighed, &quot;look, forget about it. Just...just get me some fruits or vegetables, ok?&quot; The idea of not eating any meat for the rest of my life was almost as bad as being stranded in a world of multi-colored-talking-ponies with a princess that has it in for my balls. In any case he leaned his head to point at the door. I got out of the bed and did some stretches which caused my chains to jingle and a few joints to crack which, to my amusement, seems to make the guards flinch. <i>So they do have a chink in their armor.</i> I followed them out of the room and into the hallway. </p><p>So far the hallway was as normal as hallways get, which disappointed me. Not seeing what I had expected was kind of disappointing, I had expected something like...<i>like that.</i> Once we made our way past a wooden door the scenery instantly changed. We were in the middle of another hallway but it was nothing like before. Shining marble floors and tall pillars decorated the path from one end to the other while paintings and small sculptures of intricate details, which easily could have been called masterpieces, lined the walls. I pretty much had my jaw dragging on the floor as we continued on our way. Either everyone was on vacation or we must've used a secluded route or something, because all I could hear was the constant jingling of my chains. Eventually we reached a large door, <i>large to them maybe, looks pretty normal sized to me.</i> One of the guards opened the door and let me in.</p><p>&quot;I will inform the staff to deliver the food.&quot; With that he closed the door behind me and I was finally alone. Well, not really. I knew they were just outside, but it was nice to finally be able to have some semblance of privacy. The room was simple enough, a bed large enough to accommodate my size and a table in the corner which made a nice small study area. There were a few decorations like a bookcase, some paintings, potted plants as well as a few rugs on the floor. But that's pretty much where 'simple' ends, because everything in this room was made out of the highest quality material and craftsmanship. </p><p><i>'If they’re trying to get a &quot;look how loaded I am&quot; type of Feng Shui they nailed it.' </i> There were two additional doors other than the entrance, one led to a balcony of sort considering the amount of light poring though and the other probably hid something like a bathroom. Seeing as this was a good opportunity as ever I decided to see the world I'm stuck in, so I headed towards the balcony to check out the view. </p><p>Now I don't have particular phobias to anything, that I'm aware of at least, and I enjoy a good thrill or two from roller-coasters so I'm not that much of a wimp. So let's not jump into any conclusions and assume I'm afraid of heights. </p><p>&quot;FUCK ME SIDEWAYS!&quot; Once I reached the edge my legs instantly gave out and I fell on my ass in shock. &quot;WHY!? How could anyone be retarded enough to think that having a castle on the side of a mountain would be a good idea? 'Oh hey, while were at it why don't we build a town right under it, I'm sure that nothing could ever possibly go wrong.'<br/>God!&quot; After a few deep breaths and venting out the initial surprise I was calm enough to get back on my feet, quickly making my way back inside. It was then that I heard a distant voice outside which was none other than my echo, which should carry on all the way to town and to everyone in the castle. </p><p>*snicker* &quot;Bwahahahahahaha!&quot; I laughed so hard my sides were hurting and I was starting to cry. &quot;Ladies and gentleman, I bring you the song of my people! Hahahahaha!!&quot; Eventually the laughter died off and I started to wander about the room but really nothing piqued my interest. I've never fancied myself a reader, so I didn't even look at the bookshelf. </p><p>So with nothing else to do I decided to learn more about my 'Sense', I closed my eyes and took deep breathes and focused. It came to me faster this time and like lighting candles I could feel numerous 'fires' appear in the distance and around me. I felt that some were standing still and others were moving about. Several winked out but others appear randomly about which probably meant they were going in and out of my range, roughly five meters or so <i>I guess that's as far as I can go.</i> </p><p>Seeing as the guard outside is the closest one I decided to study him instead, as I continued to focus harder something began to change. At first things were normal, <i>as normal as this shit gets'</i>, but slowly while I had my eyes closed I could feel something in my vision started to shimmer in the dark. I turned my head towards the guard and there it was. Right where the guard was standing I 'saw' a fire burning. Where all this time I could merely 'feel' them on my skin, now I could actually 'see' them. It acted just like a fire would burning on a candle, an extremely large candle. It flickered only at the slightest near the tip but otherwise it remained motionless. Suddenly the fire began to flicker and began to burn a bit more violently, I opened my eyes to see the guard looking at me through the door with both anger and confusion, <i>he must've heard me</i>. The interesting part was that I could still see his 'fire' burning inside him, it wasn't as clear as before and was translucent, giving it a ghost like fire similar to that of a will-o-wisp. After some time though the 'fire' started to fade further until it disappeared.</p><p><i>'I guess I can only keep up my 'vision' for a short while. But more importantly, it seems that the way it burns reflects the state of mood and emotion of the person, or pony. Damn this is like, a level just below mind reading.'</i> I was contemplating the responsibility I would have to shoulder with such insight, to use such a gift for ill intent would be an abuse of my blessing and just down right evil. </p><p>...</p><p><i>'Yea totally gonna start mind fucking everyone.'</i> What can I say, it’s who I am.</p><p>I heard the screeching sound of something turning and I heard the other guard returning with with my food. I had expected the guard to come in with the food. Instead, it was a mare pushing a small cart loaded with various dishes made of out of both vegetables and fruit. The smell of hot soup and steamed veggies reminded my of how hungry I was and, for the moment, I didn't care about being a vegetarian. I was so preoccupied with the thought of food I didn't realize I was licking my lips and drooling in anticipation. The cart suddenly jerked to a stop just barely out of reach and I looked at the mare questioningly. </p><p>She looked just like a regular pony with neither horn nor wings, <i>as far as regular would go in this place.'</i> She had light-brown coat and her mane and tail were a yellow-blonde color. She was also wearing a servant's uniform that was mostly black with a white apron across her back which, to be honest, was actually kinda cute. She was just staring at me eyes wide and her pupils had shrunk to the size of a coffee bean. I could hear the cart shaking causing the plates and utensils to jingle loudly. I closed my eyes and brought out my 'Sense' and sure enough I could 'see' her flame was shaking and flickering about.</p><p>She's afraid of me. <i>'Well DUUUHHH! &quot;Hey you know that monster they captured after nearly destroying Equestria? You do? Good, now go and feed it.&quot; Well, time to put on the ol’ Rodney charm.'</i> </p><p>I smiled, raised my left brow up and in a seductive tone, &quot;Hey, how ya doing?&quot; </p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p><i>'Yup, still got it.'</i></p><p>I was thinking of just taking the cart next to the bed and start eating but seeing the pony just lying there was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I pushed the cart towards the bed and went back to the mare, crouching right behind her so she wouldn't see me when she woke up. I began softly poking her in the back of her head and soon enough she stirred and moaned in response, I waited as she slowly began waking up. She must have realized where she was and <i>who</i> she was with because her head suddenly jumped up and she began to look frantically around the room. I payed attention to where she was looking and once she finished scanning the room I slowly brought my face right next to her ear and started whispering in the same tone as before.</p><p>&quot;Looking for someone suga' ?&quot; Her ears perked up and slowly she turned. Once she was fully looking at me in the eye her pupils began shrinking to an even smaller size than before. Her body began shivering in fear again, her voice was barely above a whisper and was shaking and stuttering. </p><p>&quot;A-are you going t-to eat me?&quot; Seeing as how truly terrified she was I started to feel sorry for her.</p><p>&quot;No.&quot; I said flatly and her shaking lessened. </p><p>&quot;Can-can I please go now? Please?&quot; I was about to end my little game when another idea popped into my head. </p><p>&quot;Actually, I was hoping you can help me with something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll scream if you hu-hurt me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hurt you? I will never do such a thing.&quot; She let out a long sigh of relief. &quot;In fact I think you will find the experience to be quite, <i>enjoyable.</i>&quot; She looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fear from how I emphasized the last word. I put on a mischievous smile and slowly leaned in until my mouth was inches away from her ear and began suggesting various ways she could help me learn <i>every</i> detail of pony physiology. </p><p>I could practically feel her body temperature skyrocket as she suddenly started dragging herself as far away from me as possible, all the way to the corner of the room. She was now standing on her rear hooves and leaning into the corner, her face was beet red and both her rear and forelegs were crossed in an attempt to protect herself from being <i>studied.</i> I was barely able to hold it in, but I persevered and decided to push it even further. </p><p>I slowly took intimidating steps with my arms sprayed out beside me. As an added bonus I was also wriggling my fingers around in anticipation. Once I was right on top of her I lunged forward and shot my arms to the wall so her head was right between my arms. I kept up the seductive tone while keeping my arms and legs as wide as possible, preventing her from escaping. </p><p>&quot;Are you ready my dear? Don't worry I promise to be gentle.&quot; She just kept looking at me frozen with her hooves still crossed together. I closed in on her until my my nose was inches from hers. Just as we could feel each other's breath, I whispered. &quot;Just kidding.&quot; </p><p>&quot;......Wha-what?&quot; I couldn't hold it in anymore, between the fear, her flushed face and the way she reacted to it all, I just started laughing. &quot;You..you....YOU JERK!!&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Elsewhere in Canterlot Castle...]</p></div><p>&quot;...which is why I believe that the construction of an additional track between Canterlot and Fillydelphia is worth the cost, considering how much the trade and economy will improve in both cities.&quot; Celestia was impressed with the presentation, and she too had considered building the track. </p><p>&quot;I agree. I'll forward your petition for review and if it passes then you have my permission and authority to begin construction imme-&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.audiosparx.com/sa/summary/play.cfm/crumb.1/crumc.0/sound_iid.206091" rel="nofollow">        <b>&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot;</b></a></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: click the small sound icon under play. Enjoy.)</p></div><p>&quot;Wha-what was that!?&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Forgive me, but could we continue this another time? It would seem that I am needed elsewhere.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, yes. Of course your Majesty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, please forward all documents and plans to the office for review.&quot; With that Celestia's horn glowed and one second later she disappeared in a bright flash of light. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back in the guest room...]</p></div><p><b>CRACK!</b></p><p>&quot;What is going on here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;........Oooowww.&quot; Honestly that really was all I could bring myself to say. I had expected the mare to start screaming at me, hit me in the gut or face, hell even bite me. <i>'Why in god's green earth do they all go for THE BALLS!!!'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney?&quot; All I could do was point a shaky finger at the servant mare. </p><p>&quot;Princess please forgive me, but this <i>thing</i> was about to...uhm, well he... *mumble-mumble*&quot;</p><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; The mare trotted up to the princess and began whispering to her. &quot;RODNEY!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was a joke! Oh god it hurts....&quot; I was kneeling down with my head to the floor and one arm trying to nurse my injury. </p><p>*sigh* &quot;You are dismissed, as are you two.&quot; Although the servant was more than happy to leave, the guards were hesitant to leave their princess alone with me. &quot;Now.&quot; With that final word they too left the room, so now it's just me and Celestia. <i>'Crap.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney, are you ok?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I *pant* I think I'll live.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does it...does it truly cause so much pain?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Words will never do it justice.&quot; I was able to finally stand up and look at her, but the pain was still raging on. </p><p>&quot;Perhaps you should not have angered her so. What prompted you to pull such a prank? And while I'm on the subject, did you know how much trouble you caused me with your screaming? I was with the Griffin ambassador, the first day and you nearly caused a scandal between nations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry about earlier, I promise that was completely unintentional. Which, by the way, reminds me to ask you why decided to live in a giant death trap.&quot; Celestia just looked at me confusingly. &quot;And secondly, about the prank, well. It's just who I am...and I needed it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;I just...I don't know really. At first it was all just for laughs, but now I realized I did it because I needed to. I needed to feel some resemblance to my life before all this. I've lost everything and if I don't keep my mind occupied I'll drive myself crazy.&quot; It was all true, I tried keeping it in the back of my head, tried to forget about it. But the worry and the loss of not being able to go home, see my parents and living a vegetarian life was beginning to affect my mental health. The prank was just my way of trying to cope with it all.</p><p>Suddenly all I saw was white as Celestia covered me with her wings and pulled me close in a hug. I was caught by surprise and didn't know how to respond, eventually though I hugged back. Just like that, out of nowhere, I started to cry and it wasn’t the manly silent cry either. I was bawling as tears flowed freely and began to wet her coat. I had no idea I was keeping so much inside of me, my emotions and thoughts that I kept in check just flooded out but it was too much. I had to let them all out in my tears.  My knees started to wobble and I sank to the floor, Celestia followed me all the while still holding onto me. I don't remember ever letting her go, I had cried myself to sleep under her wings.</p><p><i>'Damn....I forgot to eat.'</i></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: I was thinking about how I should go about this chapter. A part of me really wants to get the story going, and although having Rodney meeting the mane six again is still a few chapters off, I wanted to at least start things off with Twilight. But I also wanted to to settle Rodney's troubling thoughts, it’s not realistic nor interesting to simply say he’s all fine and dandy. It also gave me the opportunity to write something different for once instead of just humor.</p><br/><p>Also note that in the next few days I will be busy and moving about all over the place so I won't have as much time for writing and editing, so there will be delays. </p><br/><p>In any case I hope you enjoyed this chapter and as usual please leave C&amp;C. </p><br/><p>Now with that out of the way I still need to clean up the mess Pinkie made. </p><br/><p>Pinkie: I said I was sorry, I'll do anything to make up for it. </p><br/><p>.......anything?</p><br/><p>Pinkie: Oh buck.</p>

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 5 - The one with stars on her butt</p><p>AN: I need an editor!!</p><hr/><p>I woke up sometime near daybreak and I would have just went back to bed but I was too hungry to fall asleep. After doing a few stretches and popping some joints I got of the bed and made my way to the food from yesterday. Luckily the dish that were brought in earlier was left at the table in the other side of the room, the soup, vegetables, as well as some fruits tasted surprisingly good despite being left there over night. The apples in particular was the best I've ever tasted, they were so fresh and so sweet it was almost enough to make up for the lack of meat, almost. By the time I finished eating only four apple cores were left on the plates, it took me less than ten minutes to inhale one bowl of soup, a pile of steamed vegetables and half the fruit bowl. I threw myself on the bed and just laid there basking in the after effects of a full stomach and drifted back to sleep. I didn't even question how the soup and veggies was still hot.</p><p>A few hours later I woke up to the racket from outside the balcony. Now some might count it as a blessing, waking up to a beautiful sunshine and the sound of birds singing. I threw up a little and had to wake up with the taste of bile in my mouth.  By the amount of sunshine flooding the room it was still quite early, I was about to go back to sleep but my nose decided to wake up, <i>'damn is that me?'</i> I was stupid enough to double check and sniffed my sleeve which was so foul I began to feel a headache coming on. I got of the bed and made my way to the door which, as I suspected, lead to a bathroom. Once inside I had a hard time keeping my jaw of the floor, I had expected the bathroom to be as luxurious as the bedroom but I just didn't expect it to be so....shinny. The floor was polished marble and most of the stuff inside was made out white ceramic. The sink and tub had gold lining around the edges and the wall were decorated with artistic vines of plants and flowers. The room reflected the light so much it was hard to look without squinting, it was only until I closed the door that the light was dim enough for me to see normally. </p><p>It was weird how everything looked so familiar like the sink and the tub as well as how to control the temperature of the water. I was wondering how ponies would use the water faucets when clearly they lack the ability to grab and turn it. I decided not to question my good fortune so I went about to fill the tub with warm water, while that was filling up I looked around and sure enough found a tray with some expensive looking bottles. Most of them smelled too &quot;girly&quot; for my taste but I found one that strangely didn't smell of anything, it wasn't good or bad it was just, nothing. So I brought it to the side of the tub and started to undress, by which point I realized I would eventually have to wear it again after. </p><p><i>'I gonna have to find some more wardrobe.'</i> I was thinking of asking Celestia if it was possible for someone to make something for me, though I didn't like the thought of having to rely on her over and over again. But for the current situation I really didn't have a choice, <i>'she did say I was stuck here.'</i> </p><p>I got in the tub and with the soap I found earlier I started to lather myself while my chains jingle about. Which made me wonder if these things act the same way metal do, and whether or not they'll rust? <i>'If they did Celestia will probably just get them replaced or something, hell they got magic.'</i> With my worries laid to rest I laid back into the tub allowing the sweat and grime to float away in the water. <i>'I gotta say this is pretty nice, I'm starting to get why girls like tubs so-ZZzzZZzzz.'</i></p><p>I startled awake to the sound of knocking on the door, I quickly got out of the water and luckily I wasn't as pruned and wrinkled as I thought I would be. It took me a while but I eventually found where the towels were kept and started to dry myself of, I was drying my hair when I noticed the setup. Here I am, naked with a towel over my head and someone was just knocking on the door and I was stupid enough not to answer, <i>'Fate I swear to god if you-'</i> the door opened.</p><p><i>'I hate you so much.'</i></p><p>&quot;Is anyone in...&quot; it was the same maid from before. Her voice died out immediately once her eyes fell on me and started gawking at me. Her jaw was halfway to the floor and her eyes was looking at me under my waist and her face started to glow red. Her expression turned to that of both embarrassment and anger, I expected her to start screaming and lobbing at me, but as fast as her anger came it changed again. Her lids fell halfway and she smiled at me with a dreamy look, which disturbed me even more.</p><p>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; I asked seeing as she wasn't going to say anything.</p><p>&quot;Hmm? Oh no dear I'm quite alright,&quot; </p><p><i>'....dear?'</i></p><p>&quot;I'm just here to tell you that Princess Celestia and her student are on their way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, ok. Thank you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're welcome.&quot; I was hoping that would be the end of that but she just stood there looking at me and sizing me up. </p><p>&quot;Is there anything else?&quot; </p><p><i>'Please say no.'</i></p><p>&quot;Actually,&quot;</p><p><i>'Oh crap.'</i></p><p>&quot;I was wondering if you still needed help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Help with...what?&quot; she trotted up to me while flicking her tail about playfully. As soon as she was close enough her voice fell to a seductive tone.</p><p>&quot;Help teaching you all about pony <i>physiology.</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;OOOKAAY! I think it's best if you leave now.&quot; I was about to reach for my clothes only to find the mare standing in the way. </p><p>&quot;Oh no sir, I can't possibly let you wear such filthy clothes after your bath. It is my job to see that guests are properly, <i>taken care of.</i>&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Elsewhere in Castle Canterlot...]</p></div><p>Twilight was practically skipping along with Celestia as they made their way towards Equestria's only resident human, Celestia smiled at her student's barely contained excitement. </p><p>&quot;Excited Twilight?&quot; Twilight caught herself and started to walk normally. </p><p>&quot;I'm sorry Princess, its just I have so many questions for it. A being from another world? Who knows what we could learn from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean 'him'.&quot; Celestia corrected. </p><p>&quot;Oh right, sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright but please be mindful about him. Even with the little time I have with him, I've discovered that he's just like anypony else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand, but still I have so many questions about himself and his world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's understandable but remember what our priority is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand Princess, learning about his powers is already on top of my checklist.&quot;</p><p>&quot;However, do so with...discretion. I do not think he himself realize his own potential <i>and</i> danger. His chains should prevent any disastrous accidents, but still, its best we keep most what what we know a secret to everyone. Perhaps most of all to himself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will, though I have been meaning to ask. What are those chains? It's definitively not normal and its made out a metal I'm unfamiliar with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's best if we explain it with everypony present, Luna is also on her way as we speak.&quot; Eventually they made their way to the guest room where they find the two guards standing diligently on duty. &quot;Is everything in order?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes your Highness, the...'guest' has remained inside ever since your last visit.&quot; Celestia nodded in response and was about to make her way when the guard continued to speak. &quot;However, the maid that went inside has yet to leave. We were about to go inside and investigate before you arri-&quot;</p><p><b>CRACK!</b></p><p>&quot;Luna, good morning. You're just on time.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Good morning Sister. *yawn* And to you dear Twilight, it is always a pleasure to see you again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And to you Princess.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well then Luna, shall we begin? Or would you prefer to retire for the day?&quot; Celestia could easily see how tired her sister was, usually Luna would have slept within the hour of moonset but that has been hours ago. </p><p>&quot;Tis quite alright dear Sister, we have stayed up specifically for this session. Besides, somepony needs to keep an eye on that <i>thing</i>. And you have obviously grown fond of it.&quot; despite her sister's words Luna still found it hard to trust the creature, in fact the only reason she's here is to protect Celestia should the need arise. </p><p>&quot;I know that our initial....confrontation, was less than ideal he does not mean any harm. He can be quite troublesome with his antics but I believe his heart is in the right place, quite like yourself in fact.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Surely thou art jesting!&quot; even if it was a joke Luna did not enjoy the thought of resembling the creature in anyway or form.</p><p>&quot;I'm only asking that you give him a chance. Now, we've loitered long enough.&quot; with that the three made their way inside. It took a moment to see that the creature was nowhere in sight, Luna was about to question the guards but stopped when she heard the sound of a body hitting the floor. Both princesses looked at each other and quickly made their way to the door and as Luna's magic enveloped the door it swung swiftly open. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[23 seconds earlier....]</p></div><p>&quot;Oh no sir, I can't possibly let you wear such filthy clothes after your bath. It is my job to see that guests are properly, <i>taken care of.</i>&quot;</p><p><i>'Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!'</i></p><p>With each step the mare took I made one away from her, but as luck would have it my leg stepped on to the tra<i>l</i>ng edge of the towel around my waist and I tumbled down to the floor. Seeing her chance the mare made a dash and leaped on top of me and was now towering above me with my waist right between her front hooves. </p><p>&quot;Oh my, *giggle* you're a large one aren't you?&quot; I was too confused and rattled with the situation my mouth was pretty much working on its own.</p><p>&quot;From a pony's view I guess I do appear quite large though even in my world I was considered a bit buff, so yea you could say that.&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;I wasn't talking about your body.&quot;</p><p><i>'Oh really? Well I-</i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">gah</span><i> snap out of it! Think! It's already too far gone to talk my way out of this, I'm gonna have to get physical hopefully just get her away or knock her out gently. Wait...'</i> the memory of the nurse in the interrogation room resurfaced and immediately I tried waking up my 'Sense'. From the fear and a little adrenaline flowing in my veins the 'Sense' came almost instantly. By now her head had been slowly approaching me, going in for the kill. I basically just reenacted what I remembered with the nurse and imagined myself touching her 'fire', <i>'wow that sounded so wrong.'</i> And just like last time I could feel her 'fire' fly straight at me and disappear, the mare's eyes rapidly start to drop and her legs gave out under and she hit the floor with a loud <b>THUD!</b></p><p>I let out a long sigh, relieved I was able to dodge the bullet in time before anything happened. I looked at the mare lying with her hooves sprayed out and on top of me with her face laying sideways on my stomach. </p><p><i>'Wait a minute, </i></p><p><i>1) I'm naked. </i></p><p><i>2) there's a mare sleeping right on top of me positioned in a VERY suggestive manner. </i></p><p><i>3) I have terrible luck and Fate is a bitch.'</i></p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>&quot;Ah sonnava-&quot; before I could even finish I saw the door aglow with a deep blue aura which suddenly swung open. And right there stood Princess Celestia, a purple unicorn, and Princess Bust-a-Ball. </p><p>*tingle-tingle* <i>'Yea, I feel ya.'</i></p><p>&quot;In my defense, <i>she </i>was the one coming onto me.&quot; I could she Luna was shaking in anger and was about scream something with that sonic cannon of hers. I immediately covered my ears and braced for the coming verbal onslaught, but none came. Instead her expression was shifting from anger to, <i>something</i>, and back to anger again. It was clear she was struggling with something and apparently the others were too, though the purple one was losing badly. Soon she had the same dreamy expression as the maid and began licking her lips as her tail started twitching, she was looking at me up and down and I saw a predatory glint in her eyes. I saw Celestia's horn glow and a white-translucent bubble formed around me and the mare. Almost immediately everyone seem to snap out of it.</p><p>&quot;Wha-what? How...why did I...oh my gosh!&quot; the purple one had suddenly started to flush a deep red looked away from me.</p><p>&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's, it's nothing Princess I-I just...oh I can't believe I was about to...gah!&quot; for a moment she looked at me and recoiled immediately, her head is practically glowing red. </p><p>&quot;<b>EXPLAIN YOURSELF THIS INSTANT!</b>&quot; I saw murder in Luna's eyes I looked to Celestia hoping she could calm the raging beast, but she was also waiting for my response. </p><p>&quot;Can I at least put on my clothes first?&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later, in the bedroom....]</p></div><p>&quot;...and that's when Fate decided to screw me over again and you guys came in.&quot; I told them about how the maid was acting strangely and that I was forced to knock her out before things escalated. All the while I was still surrounded by the bubble. </p><p>&quot;And you did nothing else? No accidental magic? Nothing to yourself?&quot; </p><p>&quot;No, well at least I think I didn't. I don't even know how to use magic. All I did was take a bath, how does that result in me doing magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly what did thou do while bathing?&quot; luckily Luna had accepted the fact that this was all unintentional on my part, but she still hates my guts so there was some ice in her voice.</p><p>&quot;Nothing! It was just a bath. I filled the tub with water, grabbed the soap and started washing myself and that's it.&quot; Celestia was looking down in thought with a hoof scratching her chin. Her horn glowed and I could hear clattering in the bathroom and saw a bunch of bottles surrounded in the same aura as her horn floating towards her. </p><p>&quot;Which one of these did you use?&quot; I looked and sure enough there was the bottle of soap I used and pointed. &quot;Anything else?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;So you only used this soap and nothing else?&quot; I nodded. &quot;I see, I think I know what happened. Rodney, do humans have pheromones?&quot; it took me a while to register the unusual question and even longer to come up with an answer.</p><p>&quot;Uhh actually yea I think we do. Though its extremely minuscule and we've evolved past the point of being affected by it the same way other animals do.&quot; you're probably wondering how I know this. Well I had huge dry spell once and was getting desperate, I saw an add for some pheromone pills and got curious, unfortunately after some research turns out it's all bogus. Don't judge me.</p><p>&quot;Well it looks like we've found our cause.&quot; she shook the bottle in front of me. &quot;This bottle here has no scent because its meant to amplify others, usually used after applying fragrant soaps to enhance the smell. Since you used it and nothing else it must have amplified your, <i>other</i> smell. We ponies are intelligent but are still somewhat affected by our more, primal urges. Luckily I was able to recognize the effects and conjured the bubble in time.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh....oooooooohhh.&quot; suddenly everything makes sense, I looked towards the purple unicorn who avoided my gaze and started to blush again. Though Luna was able to look me I could see a slight tinge of pink growing on her cheeks.  </p><p>&quot;Now that we have that settled, guards!&quot; the door opened and both ponies entered the room and saluted. &quot;Please take her to the infirmary for rest.&quot; with another salute they picked up the unconscious mare and left the room. &quot;Rodney, this is Twilight Sparkle, my star pupil and your supervisor. I believe you've met before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think so. Weren't you there in the forest when I first woke up? The one with stars on her butt?&quot; she became somewhat peeved at how I mentioned her tattoo. </p><p>&quot;Yes, my <i>cutie-mark</i>.&quot; I tried to suppress my giggle but it was too late and she heard me. &quot;What's so funny?&quot;</p><p>*snort* &quot;<i>Cutie</i>-mark.&quot; she looked confused.</p><p>&quot;Whatever, I am here to help teach you how to control magic. So that you don't go about accidently shooting magic at everypony.&quot; I couldn't help but imagine walking around shooting magic beams out of my groin and throwing ponies about. It took everything I had not to go into a laughing fit.  </p><p>&quot;Actually before that can anyone explain what these are for?&quot; I lifted my arms to show them the chains, Twilight turned to Celestia.</p><p>&quot;You will need to know about magic in order to understand them properly. You see everypony has a finite amount of magic they can contain, think of it like stamina. It is also harder for somepony to control their magic if they were born with the ability to hold a larger amount of magic. You, Rodney, have an unusually large 'container', and considering how you have never used magic before you came to Equestria, you have little to no natural ability to control it. But that is not all, am I correct to assume that your world has no magic whatsoever?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are, although there are stories of some humans being able to, but their mostly works of fiction and legends. My world relies on technology and making the laws of the universe work for us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see, than it would appear my assumption were correct. Equestria is a world rich in magic, thus all living things can, in some way and form, replenish their magic over time. You however, as a creature without magic in their world, lack the ability to do so. Instead your body attempts to fill your 'container' by siphoning magic from your surrounding and even from somepony in certain cases, which is what happened to the nurse and the maid.&quot;</p><p>'So those 'fires' are their magic, and them jumping to me was actually me taking it. Great I'm a leech.'</p><p>&quot;Which is where those chains come into play, they were crafted by myself and Luna and was originally intended on somepony else.&quot; I was about to question who, but Celestia raised a hoof to silence me. &quot;That is a discussion for later, when I deem you ready. Now to continue, these chains have a special property that nullifies and cancels magic around it. It prevents you from siphoning magic unintentionally.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what about the nurse or the maid earlier? I assume that's me siphoning magic right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct, however in those instances you actively siphoned them, even though they were both unintentional is still took you some form of effort or thought to do so.&quot;</p><p><i>'Like reaching out and imagine myself touching them.'</i></p><p>&quot;What the chains prevent is your passive nature to siphon magic, a primal part and something you cannot control. Without the chains your like a sponge that absorbs everything around it with no control, with the cuffs your like a needle and only takes something you focus on and actively control. We can change how much influence the chains has upon the wearer, if we wish we can block your ability completely with nothing more than a thought. But living in a world infused by so much magic, but being the only living creature without any can cause some, unpleasant reactions.&quot;</p><p><i>'In other words, we've got you on a leash and we have a big stick.'</i></p><p>&quot;How is it that you know so much about me already?&quot; this time however Luna answered.</p><p>&quot;While thou was still unconscious after our, 'attack', we did some tests though they were mostly trial and error. Remember those wires when thou awoke?&quot; I nodded. &quot;We could not keep our equipment anywhere near you as thou would eventually start siphoning them through the wires. We had to keep them at a distance for them to work long enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought you said the chains would stop me passively absorbing magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thou is correct, however giving thou control over your active ability means we also cannot block out all of your passive ones, it would seem that anything non-living would lose their magical charge if in direct contact with you.&quot;</p><p>'So stuff here runs on a battery of magic instead of electricity and I can drain it by touch. So what if I touch actual magic?' I reached out and poked the bubble with a finger where it instantly popped causing the air in the room to shift. Twilight had immediately jumped up from her sitting position and made a dash to the door. </p><p>&quot;Calm down Twilight Sparkle, the soap has worn off quite a while ago.&quot; hearing her mentor's reassuring voice the unicorn made her way back though somewhat cautiously. &quot;So then Rodney, ready to begin your lessons?&quot; Twilight's ears suddenly perked up and she gave me a smile that shot shivers down my spine. </p><p>&quot;If it alright with you I would just like to retire for the rest of the day.&quot; I can hear Twilight's jaw hit the floor.</p><p>&quot;I understand, please be ready tomorrow morning and meet us for breakfast before we begin. The guards will escort you to the dining hall.&quot; by now Twilight was sullen and walking away from the room with her head hanging low. &quot;I will also inform the tailor to make some new wardrobe for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh tell them to make it simple, nothing like what I'm wearing. These aren't exactly my normal clothes or and they don't fit my taste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm relieved to hear that.&quot; and with that, all three made their way out the room and I was left alone.</p><p>It was still around mid afternoon but between the bathroom fiasco and what I had just learned I was ready to collapse on the floor. I jumped on the bed, closed my eyes and just let the darkness take me.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Meanwhile, in the hallway...]</p></div><p>&quot;Uhm...Princess Celestia?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Twilight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said that we should keep his potential a secret right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Than why did you tell him he had a large 'container' for magic, wouldn't that give it away?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That was a lie.&quot; Twilight looked at her mentor in confusion, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>&quot;The truth is, he has no 'container'.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!? But that's impossible, how was he able to cast magic without a 'container' to hold magic in the first place?&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;In all honesty I too do not fully understand it. Nevertheless the fact remains that he can control magic even without a 'container'.&quot; Celestia has been contemplating whether or not she should inform her student of her theory, but considering Twilight's sharp mind it would only be a matter of time before she arrives to the same theory. &quot;Twilight, what I'm about to tell you must remain a secret of the highest degree. You shall not tell anypony, not even the other elements about this, understand?&quot; Twilight was somewhat hesitant to keep anything from her friends, but she also trusted the Princess.</p><p>&quot;I understand you Majesty, you have my word.&quot; Celestia leaned in and nuzzled her gently, grateful to have such a student as trustworthy as her. </p><p>&quot;In truth Twilight, I believe that Rodney has no 'container' because he has no such limitations. I believe that, given an appropriated supply of magic, the amount of magic he can contain is infinite.&quot; Twilight was looking up to Celestia as if she had somehow gone mad in her long immortal life.</p><p>&quot;But that's...that's impossible!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it? Remember that although he failed to contain it all in himself, he was able to siphon almost all the magic in Equestria unto himself. <i>And</i> he was able to safely control such magic and return it to the land without so much as a scratch on him.&quot;</p><p>Twilight was completely stunned by the implications, such a creature would have the potential to defeat the Princesses easily. But as much as she tried to disagree, the proof was there and she saw it with her own eyes. Celestia was grateful that Twilight had stopped asking questions, for she had told another lie during the conversation. Neither Celestia nor Luna have the ability to alter the influence of the chains whatsoever, Rodney was already under the full effects of the chains from the beginning. The very same chains meant to hold the likes of Discord himself. </p><br/><br/><p>And it still wasn't enough. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: 	I hope this wasn't too confusing for some people, I tried to put the puzzle pieces together but I had trouble doing it smoothly. So anyone who a bit confused at all please speak up, I will answer the question (without spoiling) as much as I can and make changes to the chapter to make it better. </p><p>And as I mention above I do need an editor, BAD! It's taking too long for me to edit my crap by myself, so if anyone is interested please send me a private message (PM). And please point out if you have any writing or editing skills, it would help.</p><p>And that's pretty much it, probably one of the shorter AN's I made. Isn't that right Pinkie?</p><p>Pinkie: *grumble-grumble*</p><p>I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. </p><p>Pinkie: *grrrrrrr*</p><p>What's the matter cat got you tongue? </p><p>Pinkie: &quot;Hmph!&quot; *bounces away*</p><p>Best. Duct tape. Ever.</p>

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 6 - Is that pony waving at me?</p><p>AN: Next chapter will be delayed, details below. </p><hr/><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK...</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK...</p><p>&quot;Five more minutes!&quot;</p><p><b>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!</b></p><p>&quot;I'm up! Dammit I'm up!&quot; with a long sigh and a few stretches to wake up my muscles I got of the bed and opened the door. Outside was the purple unicorn from yesterday looking at me with a smile that sent chills down my spine, so I slammed the door shut and put my weight against it. </p><p>&quot;What the hay!&quot; an aura of purple suddenly formed around the door but since I was still leaning on the door it was instantly siphoned. &quot;Open the door Rodney!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Make me Twirly Sprinkles!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's <i>Twilight Sparkle!</i> Now. Open. This. Door!&quot; the door started to glow several times with the same purple aura but I just kept absorbing it. Eventually she decided to take another approach and instead of using her magic on the entire door, she focused on the door knob instead. However I when I saw it glowing I swiftly placed a single finger on it thus making the entire door immune to magic.</p><p>&quot;RODNEY!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Here's an idea, I'll let you in IF you can open the door <i>without </i> using any magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've always been somewhat confused why creatures that lack opposable thumbs or fingers would create doors with knobs, a handle would've made more sense. I mean sure you have magic but still...&quot; there was silence and I can imagine her having wrapped in thought. Eventually I felt the knob turn somewhat uncertainly as she attempted to turn the knob with her hooves. All the time I kept chuckling at every failed attempt while keeping a finger on both the knob and the door. Soon the knob did turn all the way and I thought the unicorn must've found a good enough grip. </p><p>&quot;Phhfft....HAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHAHAAAA!!&quot; it was mean but I couldn't help it. She walked in while biting on the knob with her head tilted near 90 degree to one side. Her eyes frowned and she scowled at me while still biting on the knob, causing me to fall to the ground laughing harder and gasping for air at the absurdity of the scene.	</p><p>&quot;Are you happy now?&quot; </p><p>*pant* &quot;Quite.&quot; I was still laying on the floor on my back still feeling a bit winded from my laughing fit.</p><p>&quot;Well come on then, Princess Celestia is already waiting in the dining room with breakfast.&quot; at the mention of food my stomach bade me to go with a growl which cause made Twilight giggle.</p><p>&quot;Aright, just let me freshen up a bit.&quot;</p><p>After a small trip to the bathroom Twilight and I, as well as the guards but they really don't count, made our way through the many hallways. One of them had a large opening which gave a magnificent view of the surrounding area, last time I looked I was too busy trying to not piss myself to pay any particular attention to the view except down. But now.</p><p>&quot;Woa....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite an impressive view isn't it?&quot; </p><p><i>'Impressive is right but damn....'</i> I could see a river running across the fields below as well as a forest or two and on end of the field was a large mountain rise forming across like the ground itself decided to built a wall. I saw a village down below, far smaller than the city under the Castle, I could just barely see the resident moving about and even saw something bright pink that was bouncing up and down, <i>'is...is that pony waving at me?'</i> Discarding that ridiculous notion I continue to survey the village and saw trees dotted a large landscape in an organized fashion meaning that it was cultivated, <i>'a farm then.'</i> I was about to pull myself from the amazing view but caught myself when I saw a large group of clouds far in the horizon. The clouds looked strangely <i>organized</i>, in fact some of them looked like building or pillars, I also thought I saw several waterfalls and one of them looked like liquid rainbow. It was way too early for a headache so I just chucked it off as the early morning light playing with my eyes, even if the sun was rising on the opposite side. </p><p>We got back on track and soon enough Twilight stopped in front of a lavishly decorated door which was guarded by another pair of armed ponies, though one was a unicorn and the other a pegasus. After a brief nod to Twilight they opened the door and allowed us entry, each shot me an a look of warning to behave as I made past the doorway. Except for the lavishly decorated pillars and the many paintings, potted plants and sculptures that litter the room in every corner, the dining hall simple. A large rectangular white-wood table took the majority of the room and was covered in a bronze colored cloth and was surrounded equally lavish chairs, although it was hard to tell whether or not to call them chairs. The cushions were so low it was only about a foot of the ground which makes sense for these ponies since they sit like dogs, I on the other hand might as well just sit on the floor. </p><p>Celestia was, sure enough, sitting at the other end of the table at the head, I had expected Luna to be present but she was no where in sight. But Celestia wasn't alone, near her sat a male white unicorn with blonde mane and tail which has been extensively groomed to the point of ridiculous. He was also wearing a collar from a suit, hes entire demeanor reminded me of snobbish, spoiled rich kids from the up-town. </p><p>&quot;Good morning Rodney, I see that Twilight was able to wake you up in time. I feared we would have to begin without you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry bout that Celestia, I kinda got-&quot; before I could finish though the white unicorn interrupted.</p><p>&quot;That's <i>Princess</i> Celestia to you creature!&quot; I looked at him in the eye with as much ice and malice I could muster. Without even trying the he had was already faltering and soon enough averted my gaze.</p><p><i>'Right so spoiled and a push over, probably the type that screams his station everywhere.'</i> though I couldn't imagine what Celestia sees in him other than being a waste of space. </p><p>&quot;That's quite alright, Rodney meet Prince Blueblood, my nephew.&quot; <i>'Ah, so its family ties.'</i></p><p>&quot;In that case I feel sorry for you Princess.&quot; Blueblood snapped his head and looked at me. </p><p>&quot;And what does that mean!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It means exactly what it means.&quot; I looked at him in the eye again but this time he had anger helping him hold firm under my gaze. </p><p>&quot;That's enough you two. Rodney, though I appreciate being addressed in a friendly matter, please remember that, unless in private, I do have a position of leader.&quot;</p><p><i>'And all the bullshit that comes with it, yea I understand.'</i> I gave the Princess a respectful nod of understanding and she beckoned me to sit close to her, right in front of Blueblood. I sat on the chair crossed legged which felt perfectly fine considering how low it was. Surprisingly Twilight sat next to Celestia in a smaller chair I had missed, obviously her relationship with the Princess was deeper than mere teacher and student. <i>'I better not mess with her too much then.'</i></p><p>As soon as I sat down several maid both mare and stallion started to come in from a side door pushing trays filled with dishes. They went to each member of the table placing dishes of various food, every single one of them looked delicious and decorated beautifully yet remain somewhat simple ad homely. But despite the impressive view in front of me I still noticed the lack of meat. </p><p>&quot;Uhm...Princess,&quot; </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Careful, you don't know how they go about treating meat eaters.'</span></p><p><i>'Don't worry I got this.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Sure you do.'</span></p><p><i>'Wait...who am I talking to?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Do you really think we'll have a straight mind knowing were stranded in a magical world inhabited by talking-multi-techno-colored ponies with no chance of ever going home?'</span></p><p><i>'........'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Exactly, now where were we.'</span></p><p>&quot;do you have any meat?&quot; </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">*facepalm*</span></p><p>&quot;You eat meat? Ugh simply barbaric!&quot; <i>'Suck it Blueblood.'</i></p><p>&quot;Unfortunately no, the griffin ambassador from yesterday had eaten all our supply of meat.&quot; <i>'Well at least they didn't come at me with pitchforks and torches, and meat is definitely still on the menu.'</i></p><p>&quot;It's ok Princess, humans are omnivores. We can pretty much eat anything from fruits to vegetables to meat, except for grass and flowers.&quot; I set one bowl aside which had some hay and various flowers resembling a salad of sorts. &quot;However we do require to eat meet in our diet once a while, there's a specific protein or something that we can only get from it. I'm aware that there are substitutes for meat but I don't know what they are.&quot; <i>even if I did I wouldn't tell, like hell I'm giving up on meat.'</i></p><p>&quot;I don't believe we should let this, <i>thing</i> indulge itself. In fact I don't think it's wise to be in the same room with it. It might have fleas or carry some other filth around.&quot; by this point my patients was teetering on the brink and any witty remark will only push him further and in turn drive me crazy. </p><p>&quot;Blueblood, that's quite enough.&quot; before I only suspected that Celestia was getting nothing but stress and problems from this guy, and based on the strain in her voice I concluded it to be true. Now in most circumstance I would keep egging Blueblood forever or just lunge at him and start beating his teeth in. But either choice would prove troublesome for me and for her, so in this <i>extremely</i> rare moment of understanding I decided to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>For the next few moment's it was mostly light talk between the ponies as I ate the breakfast they served, which was absolutely delicious, however Celestia must've noticed how I looked left out. Too bad she was stupid enough to assume I wanted to join the conversation.</p><p>&quot;So Rodney, would you care to tell us more about yourself?&quot; although Blueblood was somewhat irritated that I had become the center of attention and not him, Twilight's eyes bore on me and her ears perked up at attention. </p><p>&quot;Uh, what do you wanna know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about your world, I'm quite interested in how a race progresses without magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can do that, but understand I am by no means an expert on anything, so I won't be able to explain most of how things actually work.&quot; Celestia gave an understanding nod and bade me to continue. &quot;Well, as you said our world have no magic whatsoever. We rely entirely upon the law of the universe and thus created tools to help us thrive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A world with no magic, pah! What rubbish!&quot; I just ignored him and continue on.</p><p>&quot;As you can tell humans have no natural means to defend themselves, no claws or beak and our skin is frail not unlike other animals with think hide. We created tools to help defend ourselves from rocks to sharp sticks. Eventually we realize our greatest strength is in our ingenuity, our ability to craft and adapt to almost every environment. Soon enough our tools became more advance and we started to gather and build villages which grew to cities with walls and took our first step in creating our civilization. We continue to learn everything we can to help us survive and thrive, from farming for a constant food supply, to metallurgy to create armor, weapons and hardier tools. Before we know it the threat of nature and animals became a thing of the past, we have become the only species of out world with the ability to mold nature into our needs.&quot; both Celestia and especially Twilight listened intently wrapped in curiosity, even Blueblood was interested enough to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>&quot;Fast forward several thousand years and our technology was slowly approaching ludicrous notions, sometimes quite similar to what magic can accomplish. Our numbers exploded once we've mastered health care and medicine and soon enough with our advance technology and our numbers we became the masters of our world. We have created contraptions that could help us travel hundreds of miles, when that wasn't enough we created flying ships that can carry us over entire seas. Soon our sight fell to the skies, the oldest and most alluring frontier. We studied the stars and the planets around us and discovered galaxies containing thousands of solar systems. Eventually enough people got the stupid idea of actually going there, which led to one of our greatest achievement in modern history.&quot; I paused to help give a dramatic effect. </p><p>&quot;We put a man on our moon.&quot; and like clockwork I hear three jaws drop to the table, yes even Celestia's. </p><p>&quot;That's......THAT'S AMAZING!&quot; Twilight was hopping up and down towards me all the time throwing questions left and right. &quot;How did you manage to escape your plant's gravity? *hop* How did you survive the vacuum of space? *hop* And how did you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's quite enough Twilight, I do believe your starting to scare him.&quot; yes she was. </p><p>&quot;In my opinion I think it's all a bunch of lies and grandeur. I refuse to believe that anypony, except for you dear Aunt, could send someone to the moon. Especially not some....ugh monkey thing.&quot; I could imagine myself lunging forward over the table and strangle the bastard. I was about ready to throw my plate on his head just to knock him.......out. *smile*</p><p>I was probably gonna get an earful but it was worth it to teach this guy a lesson; don't FUCK with the monkey. I took several deep breaths and slowly focused on my 'Sense'. </p><p>&quot;<b>GAH!</b>&quot; I screamed in fright while awkwardly jumping backwards and tumbling over the chair. </p><p><i>'WHAT DAFUQ!!'</i>, it took a moment for me to realize I was still alive and breathing. I turned to Celestia who was gazing down on me with concern and worry. I was, for a lack of a better world, awestruck at what I felt. Her 'fire' wasn't a fire at all, from what little I felt it was like an explosion. Had I been affected by the 'heat' like normal I would no doubt be nothing more than ash or an imprint on the floor. I had respected Celestia before by how much I owed her and being in her care, but now. </p><p><i>'Rule one in Equestria: do not FUCK with Celestia!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well, maybe just a little.'</span></p><p>&quot;Something wrong Rodney?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh.....no....Princess. Sorry about that, I'm ok. My eh legs kinda fell asleep on me and I tripped trying to get up.&quot; she wasn't entirely convince but was kind enough to leave it at that. I had to take a few breathers to stop my heart from bursting out of my chest while getting back to my seat. 	</p><p>&quot;So Rodney, are you ready for first session with Twilight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh yea.&quot; despite my somewhat flat reply I was genuinely excited to learn magic, but I was still recovering from my shock to properly say anything. But seeing Twilight express a sullen and disappointed look at my flat response I quickly corrected myself. &quot;Yes Princess, I'm quite excited. Truth be told I had a hard time sleeping yesterday with the prospect of doing something humans have only dreamed of.&quot; Twilight's expression instantly made a quick 180 and was now giggling and smiling like a school girl. </p><p>&quot;I do not enjoy the thought of the monkey harnessing magic, however I doubt he even has the ability or finesse to properly master the finer arts of spell casting. In all likelihood it would all just be a waste of time.&quot; </p><p><i>'You know what Blueblood, just for that I'm going to make you my first target practice.'</i> </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: I know this chapter is somewhat shorter than I normal, but I didn't have enough time left to write and edit since I gotta go prepare for a trip. Which is why the next chapter will be delayed, don't worry though I'm still gonna write while I'm gone. It's just that I won't be able to post it up. So once I get back I'll immediately copy/paste to the site and publish it. </p><p>So till then, cya!</p>

<p>Shackles and Friendship<br/>Chapter 7 - I do NOT have a fetish for ponies!</p><p>AN: By now some of you may realize I choose whatever I like for the chapter tittles. </p><hr/><p>Once breakfast was done we went about our ways, Celestia had court duties and the like while Blueblood was already being a pain to everyone’s existence, before Twilight and I even left the room he was already complaining about his food or some other nonsense. </p><p><i>‘I’m surprised they haven’t tried to poison him yet.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We’ll change that.’</span></p><p>Twilight lead me to a room which, except for a few chairs and tables, were completely empty, only the walls had any form of decoration. On one table stood several small stacks of books and on another table was a pile of random items ranging from rubber balls to sticks and even a deck of cards. </p><p>“That’s for later, first we need to go over the basics. Now then,” several thick tomes glowed purple and levitated towards a table in front of me and fell in a neat stack, “ready?”</p><p>“Twilight...no.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? We haven’t even started.”</p><p>“And by the looks of things we won’t get started for several months.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>*sigh* “Let me guess, you're going to educate me in the entire history and theory of magic, including every known significant person and how they revolutionized modern magic as you know it.”</p><p>“Well, yes. And that’s ‘significant pony’. You need the basic knowledge and theory to how magic work before we can get to the practical side of training.”</p><p>“Twilight...NO!”</p><p>“Why? Do you have a problem with books!?” from the way her left eye is twitching this must be a touchy subject.</p><p>“No nothing, I love them in fact. It’s just know from experience that going things by theory won’t work for me. I’ve always been the type to run first before I can walk.”</p><p>“That makes no sense!”</p><p>“How’s about a compromise then? We’ll go straight to practical training,” <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘cause we can’t wait to deal with Blueblood.’</span> “and I’ll hit the books at night. Its always been easier for me to learn from books that way, reading under the stars just feels right.” Twilight placed a hoof under her chin as she considered my proposition. </p><p>“I'll accept under one condition, during the start of every session I’ll quiz you in order to keep you on track.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t have it any other way.” she nodded in approval.</p><p>“In that case, the next item on the checklist is learning control.”</p><p>“Wait, I thought the entire point of this <i>was</i> to learn control.”</p><p>“True, but what I meant was your ability to drain in particular. The only way for you to do magic is to first take it. That is why you’ll be taking some of mine during our sessions. And the main idea is taking <i>some</i> of my magic. From what I can conclude based on your track record you have control over who to take it from but not how much, you just take it all.”</p><p>“And how do we go about doing that? If I practice on you I’ll have to wait until you recover everytime I make a mistake, that’s just wasting too much time. Unless you got a group of ponies who volenteer to have their magic drained by an unknown creature that nearly wiped them out.”</p><p>*giggle* “Simple,” her horn glowed and slowly her aura started to expand from the tip into a small purple mass, eventually it drifted apart from her and floated towards an empty space in front of me where it stayed still. “<i>that</i> is what you’ll be working on. Try to only take some of the magic, the target for now is to take only a quarter(1/4) of it. I made this spell specifically for this purpose so I’ve design it to change color to green if you reached the exact mark and red if you failed, plus the spell allows me to replenish it automatically that way you can go crazy with it.&quot;</p><p>“I’m impressed you’ve prepared this far, and I’m grateful that you went so far just for me. I doubt the spell you made would have any other purpose other than for my own benefit. Thank you Twilight. ”</p><p>“Uh...your welcome?” I must have caught Twilight by surprise with my sincere gratitude. Had I looked longer I would have seen a small tinge of red grow on her cheeks. “Well, what are you waiting for? Get to it.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Initially I had constantly failed at every attempt, no matter how gently or little I reach out, it was either too much and I absorbed it entirely, or too little and nothing happened. I tried using my 'Sight' to try and see the magic in the spell hoping to see if it would help. Unlike the 'fire' everyone has that burns like a candle, Twilight's spell were like wild flames flowing about like a breeze trapped in an invisible sphere. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/d8b80f4ce4092d48250c3bc5c2361d35838490bc?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc02.deviantart.net%2Ffs21%2Ff%2F2007%2F274%2Fc%2Fd%2FOrb_Of_Light_by_dare_to_disgrace.jpg" /></p></div><p>With some visual help I tried picturing the mass to be cut and divided up to equal pieces and focused on absorbing only that piece, which is impossible since the 'flames' inside kept moving about. After a fail attempt I was surprised to 'see' a white trail of flame flowing from Twilight's horn and began to replenish the spell with more magic. So even though my 'Sight' didn't help, it did show me what actual spells looked like. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Think! What do you need in order to take a specific amount of magic from the whole?'</span></p><p><i>'That's later, for now we need to figure out how to take only parts of it. Well move on to how much later.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And it isn't working! You have no control once we start absorbing.'</span></p><p><i>'So instead of trying to control it after....'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Yeeeessss.'</span></p><p><i>'...I need to have control before I try to take it.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Warmer.'</span></p><p><i>'And in order to do that I need to first now exactly how much I want to take.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">*sniff-sniff* 'They grow up so fast.'</span></p><p><i>'What's with the attitude?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I'm your subconscious, your id. I'm you without the morals and crap that would restrict our inhibitions. And to keep things in perspective even with those restrictions you're still a jerk who likes pulling lecherous pranks on ponies, which by the way is the focus of your new fetish, so bite me!'</span></p><p><i>'I do </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">NOT</span><i> have a fetish for ponies!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Helloooo! Subconscious? I am constantly reminded how fucked up we are as a person, even if you don't.'</span></p><p><i>'Can we please just get back to the main issue here?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Fine, ignore me and just avoid facing the truth as usual. Pussy.'</span></p><p><i>'</i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">ANYWAY!</span><i> I tried using 'Sight' but it's impossible to measure it by visual, I don't even know how to measure something gaseous. As far as I know you need a machine to do that.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Then simply try measuring it in a different way.'</span></p><p><i>'What else is there? All I can do is 'see' and........really?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Just get this over with, imma finish up our plan for Blueblood.'</span></p><p>I had overlooked that fact that I could also ‘Feel’ magic, I was aware of Twilight's 'fire' as well as several ponies around me, but I never actually focused on 'feeling' the heat from the spell itself because I could barely feel it. There was heat radiating from the spell but it was so pathetically weaker than a 'fire'. It's like having a candle burn next to a bonfire, you can hardly feel the candle's heat from the bonfire's. Following the advice of my id, <i>'douche'</i> <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'prick'</span>, I began to focus entirely on the spell alone. Soon everything I 'sensed' other than the spell started to become muddled in the background until I barely register them. I pushed every cell and nerve to open up to the sensation, I then began to feel pressure as well as the heat radiating of the spell. To be more accurate the sensation was more like a weight pushing to me. It was similar to holding something and feeling it's weight only this time the weight was upon your entire body, like a heavy blanket. </p><p>It was like holding a cup of water in your hand, by the weight you can judge approximately how much water there is. I imagined on what felt like a quarter (1/4) of the total weight and concentrated on that imaginative sensation, then I reached out and touched the spell. And presto that was the trick, the floating purple aura was still there but visibly smaller than before. I was also startled when I could actually feel the magic going in me unlike before when I felt nothing, it was like warm water spreading from inside my chest outwards till the tip of my arms and legs, and with it I felt the exact amount of weight I concentrated earlier on. But what surprised me even more was that the spell was now glowing green instead of red. I seriously doubt that I had understood everything that just happened, I am after all dealing with powers completely unknown so I guess most of the actual work is done subconsciously or instinctively. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Your welcome.’</span>  I looked over to Twilight expecting her approval but she was busy reading a book larger than her head, completely obscuring her view. I was about to announce my success but the spell had stopped glowing green while the mass had already swelled up to its original size, it appears that Twilight had rigged the spell to constantly replenish despite the outcome.</p><p><i>'Let's practice a bit and really impress Twilight.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'So that we can see her dislocate her jaw again? Hells yea!'</span> </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later......]</p></div><p>“Done.”</p><p>“Hm?” she peered over the rim to see the mass smaller and her spell glowing green. “ Excellent, now do half.” I waited until she went back behind her book and without giving her a chance to continue reading I interrupted her again.</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Done.” I repeated. Twilight peeked again and sure enough the mass was half smaller and her spell was glowing green again. </p><p>“Oooookay, then do a fifth.” this time I didn't even give her a chance to look away.</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“WHAT!?” Twilight had discarded her book on the table and walking over to inspect her spell, probably thinking there's something wrong with it, <i>'oh ye of little faith.'</i> “How did you...?”</p><p>“Once I figured out the trick it was easy, hardest part was going through trial and error to find the trick.” </p><p>“Then do three-fourth(3/4).”</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“Two-third(2/3)?”</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“One-sixth(1/6)!” </p><p>“Done.” by now it became a sort of challenge Twilight was more than willing to help.</p><p>“Three-seventh(3/7)! Five-eighth(5/8)! Two-twelfth(2/12)!”</p><p>“Done, done, aaaaaaaaaaand done!”</p><p>“Ugh, a hundred and twenty eight of one sixty(128/160)!”</p><p>“Really?” she just stared at with a smug smile just daring me to do it, and I wasn’t the type to turn down a challenge. Now I may not be the smartest guy in the world, especially with how much weed I smoked, but even I realize there's no way I can concentrate to such a detail. Luckily I know math. (AN: 128/160 = 4/5)</p><p>“Done!” and just as the spell glowed green Twilight’s flank and jaw both drooped to the floor.  <i>‘Were never gonna get tired of seeing that are we?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Nnooooope.’</span></p><p>“Ho-how did you do that!?”</p><p>“It’s called skill.” <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Nice.’</span></p><p>“But you were supposed to take longer than that!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Now I have to completely redo my schedule!”</p><p><i>‘What?’</i></p><p>“I was hoping to catch up with my reading while you train but you just had to breeze through it don’t ya? *inhale-exhale* Ok, no worries. I’m sure I can fit this to next month’s schedule.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'What?'</span></p><p>“Soooooooo, do you want to call it a day then?”</p><p>*sigh* &quot;No no, its fine. Let’s move on to the next control exercise.&quot;</p><p>“Alright, but is it ok if we take a break first? I'm starting to have a headache.” the training wasn’t physically draining, but it did take a lot of mental work and it was starting to strain. </p><p>“Oh really? A headache? Is it bad? On a scale of one to ten how painful is it?”</p><p>“Uuuuuh not much really...probably a two-wait. Why?” based on her voice this was more than just simple concern.</p><p>“Oh sorry. I kinda forgot to mention earlier but headaches are kinda expected. Heh...sorry.” I was about to question her but Twilight continued on before I could even start. “Remember what Princess Celestia said about ponies with larger ‘containers’ for magic?”</p><p>“The more one has the harder it is to control?”</p><p>“Correct, and by the looks of it you're near the limit on how much you can control. Siphoning any more could cause you to accidently start releasing excess magic, and without actual knowledge or skill to properly channel them out, the results could be violent.” </p><p>“Can’t I just go and ‘release’ it on Blueblood?”</p><p>“Well maybe if-no!

In order to cast spells you have to first collect the needed amount of magic to cast it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The same way your horn glows?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly, for unicorns like myself we first gather the needed amount of magic to our horns and contain it there until we're ready to cast. My 'aura' as you call it, prevents my magic from leaking out but its also used to mold the magic. That is essentially what spells are, molding magical energy to act in certain ways that help us accomplish specific tasks. By properly molding the magic in particular ways it can create near limitless reactions which we take advantage of.&quot;</p><p><i>'So its really just like how we use science, it just follows a different set of rules then the rest of the universe.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Different rules yes but still rules they obey, so if we master the rules...'</span></p><p><i>'We master magic.'</i></p><p>&quot;Now there are three different types of spells: actives, passives, and constants. You can study these later on in the books I've prepared. We won't be doing none of them, in order for somepony to cast spells they need to learn how to bring out their magical energy, its the first step to learning magic. Any questions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One, I understand what you meant when trying to visualize a faucet to control the flow of magic, but exactly where should I plug the faucet to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a bit tricky since nopony have ever studied a human before, <i>yet.</i>&quot; a jolt of frost shut down my spine.</p><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Hm? Oh nothing. But like I said, nopony knows anything about humans, so really I can't confidently answer. However it's definitely somewhere in your body.&quot;</p><p><i>'Let's hope it's nut in my nuts.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Why? I think it would be awesome! Imagine controlling the powers to bend the laws of the universe to our will all from our junk.'</span></p><p><i>'True but considering how close Luna came to destroying it, might as well be defective.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Good point.'</span></p><p>I closed my eyes and dove into my memory, specifically those in the interrogation room. I analyzed every sensation I could remember when I threw that guard across the room. <i>'I swear if I ever see that guard again I'll-'</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'They all look the same, so unless you want to take on the entire army I suggest you...actually can we do that sometime?'</span></p><p><i>'Let's just focus on actually finding a way to fight them before we go charging to the barracks.'</i> I focused again into my memories towards the particular moment just before my balls shot a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadouken_(Street_Fighter)#Hadouken" rel="nofollow">Hadouken</a>. I tried bring out the same surge of heat I felt inside me, even tried to immerse in the same feeling of panic and fear, but nothing changed. 'Wait a minute since I did that instinctively you must know how to do it.'</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Sorry pal but I wasn't around when that happened, I'm as much in the dark.'</span></p><p><i>'Dammit!'</i> I let out a long sigh.	</p><p>&quot;Anything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry Twilight, guess I'm just good at taking things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't say that, c'mon you've only been at it for a couple of minutes. Keep trying.&quot; giving her a grateful smile, I closed my eyes and tried again. Then the idea hit me, <i>'if I can take magic in, maybe I can take magic out.'</i> With renewed vigor I focused on my 'Sense', however instead feeling outwards I blocked out all other sensation and focused entirely inwards. Slowly I focused on every single part of my body, every fiber and cell for any hint of 'heat' I felt from everybody else. It was when I concentrated around my stomach did I begin to feel a small radiating heat. I then tried using my 'Sight' but saw nothing but darkness as I stared down to my belly. </p><p><i>'Maybe I was wrong...'</i> but I wasn't willing to give up just yet, the sensation of the 'heat' was all too familiar. I kept looking while keeping my focus and 'Sight', and very slowly I saw a dim azure glow. It was barely there at first but it came again stronger. In the blackness of my vision it looked like a single star blinking in and out, but glowed stronger and stronger. Soon enough it was strong enough to shine a brilliant light azure without blinking out and it still continued to grow. The anticipation was agonizing, it was like watching the birth of a star somewhere of on the other side of the universe. It continued to grow until it was just smaller than an apple, and the heat I felt was just as strong as other's, <i>'maybe even stronger, though still not even close to Twilight's.'</i> </p><p>I waited a bit longer but my 'fire' didn't grow any larger, I felt the same surge of heat somewhere in my stomach but its like that itch you can never really tell where it's located, it's just somewhere there. As Twilight suggested I imagined a faucet attached to the 'fire' and slowly opened the flow. Small licks of flame started to leave and was flowing outwards randomly about and I can feel the same warmth spreading out across my body. I remembered how I felt the heat all over my body coverage to my groin, as much as that would be to repeat I doubt Twilight would enjoy it. So instead I imagined a hose attached to the faucet going upwards to my chest and to my right shoulder, eventually ending at the palm of my right hand. The flames continued to flow out and like water followed the path of the hose, I stretched out my right arm and 'looked' at my palms where the fire started to flow out. </p><p>&quot;Good, now imagine wrapping the magic in a small bubble and once it's filled shut of the faucet.&quot; I'm not sure what Twilight saw exactly but I wasn't willing to risk opening my eyes and losing focus when I was so close. I imagined holding a glass sphere, similar to that of Twilight's spell from earlier, and stuck it with the hose. The flames poured into the sphere and started flowing about inside it. It was beautiful to say the least, how the azure flames flowed about like there was a current inside the sphere and danced to it. As if agreeing I heard Twilight let out a gasp, but it wasn't in fear or being startled, it was a pleasant one that comes from someone enjoying a surprise gift. Soon the sphere was filled to the brim and the flames inside were dancing all around in unison. I let out a long sigh of relief and opened my eyes. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/c7998a7402e8cddc149e20a5345f85660f4b689a?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc00.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Fi%2F2012%2F013%2F9%2Fd%2Frasengan__by_anniemae88-d4m6zsx.jpg" /></p></div><p>&quot;Wooooooaaaah....&quot; at first I thought my 'Sight' was still on. But by the looks of Twilight's face she was as hypnotized by the dancing flames as I was. We just continued to stare at it lost in it's otherworldly beauty until Twilight spoke, though it was more to herself. </p><p>&quot;I've never seen magic look like <i>that</i> before.&quot; her voice snapped me out of my trance. </p><p>&quot;So what do I do with it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uuuhh....throw it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!?&quot; the thought of trowing away something like this, and the fact that I made it, was preposterous. </p><p>&quot;Look your not ready to go into practical spell molding, you haven't read the theory behind it and you need to rest.&quot; I was about to argue that I felt just perfectly fine but she wouldn't listen to any of it. &quot;Look we'll continue tomorrow and it's perfectly safe. Since you never tampered with the magic its still in it's raw form, it'll just go and get absorbed to the land or one of the equipment in the castle design to take stray magic.&quot; I looked down to the sphere in my palm, the flames dancing hypnotically. </p><p>&quot;Well, if you say so.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back to the present....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney did you do anything to it?&quot; she looked at me suspiciously.</p><p>&quot;No I didn't! I don't even know how. Why did you think I wanted to blow myself up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because you just said you wanted to 'start lobbing fireballs' a moment ago!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why would I want to endanger you,&quot; I pointed to her. &quot;...or myself,&quot; I pointed to my chest. &quot;...or redecorate the castle!&quot; I pointed to the gigantic hole in the wall that used to be half the wall and some of the floor and roof. From the hole I could see a pony shaking in his seat looking as if he was just about to write stamp a document before the floor inches in front of him blew up, burnt documents were slowly falling about the place like leaves.</p><p>After several more screaming and yelling, and getting tackled to the floor by a few guards, I was escorted back to my room and told to stay there for the rest of the day under guard. I sat on the bed and slowly the shock started to ware of and I came to fully realize what I had just done. With a smile I walked out to the balcony, I was too happy to even care about how stupidly high I was or how immature I was going to sound, I sucked in and with all my might shouted.</p><p><b>&quot;I THREW A FIREBAAAAAALLLL&quot;</b> *inhale* <b>&quot;YOU BETTER WATCH YOU ASS BLUEBLOOD!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!&quot;</b> I walked back panting and out of breath but feeling like a million bucks. It was then that I realized several folded clothes on the table, it was a simple white shirt and long pants and a jacket similar to my hoddie which, coincidentally, was light blue resembling the color of my 'fire'. I took the shirt and pants and took a bath and spent the rest of the day reading some of the books Twilight had given to me.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[In Twilight's room...]</p></div><p><i>Observation Report 3,</i></p><p><i>Subject shows and amazing level of adaptation to magic despite having no prior experience with magic.

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 8 - Death by gay snu-snu</p><p>(AN: &quot;Have a emergency kit of cupcakes in case of '4th wall breaking pink pony that's clearly out of her mind'. &quot; A bit too late Noxxels.)</p><hr/><p>&quot;There are three types of magic: actives, passives, and constants.&quot; although I had agreed to the quizzes it was still taking too damn long. Twilight was meticulous about my reading to a point of almost questioning every base theory from the book, and it was driving me crazy!</p><p>&quot;Correct, now explain them in detail and give examples please.&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Actives: basically just one time spells that needs to be manually activated consciously by the caster and expires once the spell activates or uses up their magic. An example would be, well, my impromptu fireball for one.&quot; *smile*</p><p>&quot;Yes, that one counts.&quot; she said irritably. &quot;Next?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Passives: spells or traits that are subtle in nature and are continuously in effect without conscious thought, however they can remain dormant and only activate once a particular action or situation arises which is the only time they will actually drain the caster of magic. An example would be inherit traits found in, eh....'normal' ponies?&quot; </p><p>&quot;<i>Earth</i> ponies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right them. Their inherit traits which give them their endurance, vitality and green thumb are considered passive spells. That part I get but the book also states that these passive traits constantly eat up magic right? Then how come earth ponies can constantly keep them active?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The traits of earth ponies are a special case, they may not be able to weave magic like unicorns but they can replenish their magical reserve much faster than us. Another reason why their's is special is because for some unknown reason the spells on them change and adapt to match how fast they regain magic. It's the reason why earth ponies have little to no magic in their 'container', its constantly used up to keep their traits active. In fact that also applies to pegasus ponies for their ability to fly and manipulate the weather. But what's a 'green thumb'? Ponies don't have any fingers like you do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just a human phrase, means you have a gift with plants. And what do you mean they manipulate the weather?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Pegasus ponies maintain the weather in Equestria, how else are we supposed to make it rain or change the season?&quot;</p><p>&quot;By letting them do it themselves? The weather in my world acts on laws of heat and cold as well as geographical locations. The most we can do is predict the weather or send certain particles to clouds to make it rain.&quot; Twilight's pupils grew twice as large and she had that creepy smile again, thus I made a tactical retreat and quickly changed the subject. &quot;However, the drawback to passive spells is that once somebody cast it-&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Somepony.</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whatever, once the spell is activated the caster no longer has control over them, which is why passive spells take the most time to be prepared and programmed correctly, thus considered the most difficult school of magic to master. And although they are not the most dangerous type of spells, they have caused the most accidents due to oversight or errors in the caster's part to predict certain situations. They can also be programmed to end, usual by a phrase or by certain outcomes in case the spell becomes permanently active and drain the caster entirely of magic, which will also cause the spell to terminate.&quot; personally I was most interested in studying this particular aspect of magic than the rest, as a simulations programmer I could appreciated it's potential, <i>'video games for life!'</i> (AN: C++ is boss)</p><p>&quot;You're forgetting something important.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uuuh, no I don't think so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes you are, a critical one. Until about two hundred years ago everypony thought that passive spells can only be used to yourself and nopony else. However, Mind Mole, discovered that if you can weave the spell in a way that's identical to somepony's brainwaves, then one can cast it on them. The results are similar to hypnosis, but unlike hypnosis one can potentially make the target do whatever the caster wishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh right, the guy that had like 50 plus wives or something.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Of course you would take notice of that one.&quot; she was rolling her eyes in mock surprise.</p><p>&quot;And what does that mean?&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Probably because she suspect we're just as much of a lecherous prick as he was. For ponies might I add.'</span></p><p><i>'For the last time I do not-'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Denial much?'</span></p><p>&quot;Nothing. In any case, one flaw to this kind of manipulation spell is that once the target, or in his case, his victim becomes aware of the spell it was instantly undone. Which ended his ruse and he was banished to an island inhabited by a tribe of ponies that...uh, were happy to take him in.&quot; Twilight was blushing a bit towards the end.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean, '<i>happy</i> to take him in'?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The tribe's mares live on another island, yet the stallions remain very sexually active.&quot;</p><p><i>'Wow. Death by gay </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Women_in_the_Mood" rel="nofollow"><i>snu-snu</i></a><i>.'</i></p><p>&quot;We're getting of track, explain constant spells please.&quot; I was just as willing to change the subject and hopefully get the disturbing image out of my mind.</p><p>&quot;Constant spells are considered a hybrid of the other two. Like active spells they require conscious thought and effort to cast, and like passive spells they remain active with constant focus from the caster and will constantly drain them of magic. However unlike passive spells that can lay dormant, constant spells are always active as long as the caster is willing and able to keep it active. Examples of constant spells can range from several shield spells and the levitation spell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very good, can you tell me which type of spell I used for your exercise?&quot; I have actually given it some thought last night. The way it worked was very similar to passive spells but it didn't look like one, I thought it was a constant spell but Twilight wasn't paying any attention at all and was busy reading. But even if she was able to multi-task to such extremes she would have known I've been practicing on the spell since she needed to focus on it, her surprise reaction proved that she wasn't aware of what happen to her spell. So it isn't a passive or a constant spell, and definitely not an active spell either. </p><p>&quot;Is it a passive-constant hybrid?&quot; by the looks on Twilight's surprised expression I though I nailed it. </p><p>&quot;I'm impressed, that's a very close assumption but no it isn't. It's actually a combination of two spells, a passive and constant.&quot; the gears in my head was already on overdrive and I already had another theory in mind. </p><p>&quot;So you cast a passive spell first on yourself that would automatically supply any constant spells you cast after with magic whenever they start to run out. Actually scratch that, it's too messy. You have a passive spell on you that would activate by some kind of signal from another spell, like a beacon or pulse. Then you cast a constant spell which would send the signal whenever it has less than a specific amount of magic, which the passive spell will start to replenish. You created a system which allows the passive spell control the constant spell, but I doubt it's that simple.&quot; it was more thinking out loud than actually answering the question. I was looking absently in front of me, I didn't even notice that Twilight was looking at me slacked jawed with a glazed look on her eyes. She even started to droll. &quot;Twilight?&quot; at the mention of her name she startled back into reality. </p><p>&quot;Did-did you just thought of that now?&quot; at least she had her mouth closed but she was still looking at me with that same glazed look as before. </p><p>&quot;Uh, yes?&quot; that look was getting more disturbing by the second. </p><p>&quot;Did anyone else talk to you about magic? Did you find a book or something? Was it Princess Celestia?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No to all three....sorry?&quot; I was starting to get a bit worried.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Actually were scared right now.'</span></p><p>&quot;I've never heard of such a thing. That's an entirely new concept! A spell that communicates and controls another spell? You might have just revolutionized magic theory!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you just thought about it out of blue!? Rodney I could kiss you!&quot;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'YES!!'</span></p><p>&quot;NO!&quot; Twilight jumped back at my sudden outburst her ears flat and was looking at me with some fear in her eyes. &quot;Sorry Twilight, I mean no that's quite alright. And I doubt I revolutionized anything. How would anyone take my ideas seriously if I can't even do magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I, I guess that sort of makes sense.&quot; </p><p>&quot;So can we keep focus and finally let me do some magic?&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Fine, but Rodney. I really think you were on to something there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll figure it out after, ok?&quot; with another sigh she nodded.</p><p>&quot;We'll do the control exercise and then well try our hoof at spell weaving.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Control exercise was more or less similar as yesterday, I still had to make some effort to bring out my magic but it was getting easier. However Twilight forbade me from actually drawing out any before I learn how to actually weave and mold it correctly to a harmless spell. Thus for about an hour we focused on concentration and trying to devise a training program to help me improve my overall ability. Unfortunately that was all just warm up, the actual control training started after. Twilight cast the same spell as before and I saw the same purple mass of aura floating in front of me. I thought we were going to have a do the same thing as yesterday but Twilight had something else in mind. </p><p>&quot;Based on yesterday's performance I don't think there's any more need to do it again. Now however, I want you to absorb the magic in the spell constantly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Think of how constant spells continuously drain the caster of magic while it's active, you're pretty much doing the same. Last time you learn how to properly take certain amounts entirely, but it was like cutting it up to pieces. Now you need to constantly keep draining the magic but at a controlled and even rate. The target is 1/10th every second, so it should take you ten seconds to drain the spell entirely. The spell will track the amount of magic its losing and will constantly glow green if the rate is even. In other words you have to make it green for ten whole seconds.&quot;</p><p>At first it sounded like a waste of time, however thinking it over such a skill would be quite useful. Absorbing someone's magic a piece at a time would probably be noticeable, and even if I took it by minuscule amounts its not worth the required level of concentration. But taking it constantly and evenly would be far more efficient and less noticeable, they would slowly feel tired and exhausted instead of suddenly feeling their energy drained. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Just like a leech.'</span></p><p><i>*sigh* 'Yes, just like a leech.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh sweet lord we have progress! Now maybe if you can accept the fact that-'</span></p><p><i>'I swear if you say the word 'fetish' one more time I'll torture you with the worst memory we have.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You wouldn't dare, you'd be suffering as much as I would.'</span></p><p><i>'Just like you say, I'm a jerk. And the thought that I'm torturing you will be enough.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'...touche.'</span></p><p>It took about two or three hours, but eventually I was able to have a reasonably steady flow. It wasn't all that hard to find the trick, it only took me half an hour to get the idea of imagining a faucet and a hose the same way I did when I tried to use my own magic, the only difference was that I had to plug the faucet to the spell. The hard part was trying to keep the flow even, the rate keeps fluctuating up and down and some magic tend to escape as they travel towards me. From this point on it was all just practicing and actually getting into the right mindset to keep the flow even. But so far I still couldn't keep the flow exactly even, I was at least able to control it to drain it all in ten seconds flat but it the flow was never consistent. And soon enough I began to feel the same headache as before start to develop. </p><p>&quot;Sorry Twilight, but that's as far as I can go. Looks like I've reached my limit for the day.&quot; although I was actually looking towards learning magic, it still sucked to fail. </p><p>&quot;The headaches?&quot; I nodded while messaging my forehead. &quot;Well at the least you've made some progress, we can continue on tomorrow. Ready for some spell weaving?&quot; immediately my mood improved and I was beaming at her. *giggle* &quot;I take it that's a yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop teasing me Twilight, that's just cold.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Party pooper.&quot; she said in a mock pout. Twilight beckon me to sit on a large pillow close to her, as I got closer I saw there were several balls laying on the floor, the same one's I saw yesterday. &quot;So, weaving spells.&quot; she began as I sat down. &quot;As you remember to cast a spell you must first collect the necessary amount of magic required, then by molding or weaving the spell in certain ways the magic will react differently and create certain outcomes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how exactly do I do that? Weaving and molding magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's actually hard to say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Meaning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well to everypony, that are unicorns of course, weave and mold magic differently. Although we all call it weaving or molding, its for everypony.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So it's not actually a definite technique or method to follow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm afraid not, though the way I do it is very much so. Rodney please, let me explain and finish all the way and then I'll answer any question.&quot; I shut my mouth and nodded. &quot;Thank you. Now like I said, for <i>me</i> I weave spells by following a proper method to achieve several different effects from magic. I see them as formulas and equations which I'm particularly good at. However my friend Rarity, who makes a living as a seamstress, once explain to me that she weaves her magic the same way she does her work. She imagine's and feels her magic like a piece of cloth and makes modifications and alterations to them the same way she would make a dress. However even if everypony weaves it differently, they end up being identical to everypony else. If I cast a spell and Rarity cast the same spell, we both might mold the magic differently but the result is still the same. Imagine creating something that's identical however the only difference is what tools Rarity and I use. Mostly that the way we weave magic is somehow connected to our cutie-marks which gives us a clue, but seeing as you don't have one...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Means its all up to me getting a lucky shot in the dark.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm afraid so, really the only advice I can give you is to remember what you love or what your good at and try to apply it to magic in someway. We'll attempt one of the simplest spell, try to lift the balls up with a levitation spell.&quot; To say I was disappointed was an understatement, I had somewhat expected to learn magic with words of power or incantations with runes and shit. But if Twilight says is true there's a good chance I might never actually do proper magic, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'well at least we can still lob fireballs.'</span></p><p><i>'True, but still we could do so much more.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'So what are we good at?

She said to focus on what we like right?'</span></p><p><i>'Or skilled at.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Try to imagine smoking magic like a joint.'</span></p><p><i>'Really?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You can't deny that were very good at it, but yea that probably won't work. So what else then?'</span></p><p><i>'Well we pretty much sold out souls to video games, it's what made us change out major and move to...'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Devry University to study...'</span></p><p><i>'Game Programming......you don't suppose that-'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'One way to find out, I'll take care of memorizing it.

I opened my eyes while still keeping focus but I saw nothing, at least nothing that changed. I turned to Twilight to ask what was wrong but she was too busy looking up towards the ceiling, I turned my gaze upwards to where she was looking. There hovering about a meter above the floor was one of the ball, I didn't notice that one of the balls were missing. There was no doubt that it was me who was keeping the ball floating because unlike Twilight's spell that has a purple aura, the ball was covered in the same azure fire from yesterday. I thought my magic might be burning it but there was no smoke and the ball didn't change color nor was there any smell of burning rubber filling the room. For the second time Twilight and I were caught transfixed by the dancing blue fire. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/c4828fdec9ffac1d5888bd2f7e1bb3e667840ee1?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc06.deviantart.net%2Ffs45%2Ff%2F2009%2F141%2Fb%2Fa%2FInner_Fire_by_perspectiva.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Eh, close enough.)</p></div><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Now THAT, is what a fireball should look like.'</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Night time, in Twilight's room...]</p></div><p><i>Observation Report 4</i></p><p><i>Subject continues to make progress today, although he did have trouble dealing with the lat phase of his control exercise but should be able to master it in a few days.

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 9 - It was all her idea!</p><p>&quot;Once you do your thing and make your shit, don't stop there. Go retire as a teacher and help nurture future game developers. It's good for the market, it changes lives and it's good for the soul.&quot; - Jim Rivers</p><hr/><p>It's been three days since that momentous day, three days after I weaved my first spell, or should I say 'programmed' my first spell? In any case, after that day I was studying magic with fervor, practically on borderline insanity. But honestly what do you expect? It's MAGIC! All the fantastic stories and lore created by the most amazingly gifted or fucked up minds of our kind suddenly became a reality to me. </p><p>Twilight didn't seem to mind though, in fact she was more than willing to help when I kept egging her on for more books every night, I was practically reading them front to end in one sitting. And if it was too late at night to ask for more I just started working on the training program Twilight made for me. I've discovered that spells were easier if I created an input feature with my hands to help control the spell, similar to how programs take in keyboard and mouse inputs. As helpful as my id is, he's mostly preoccupied with memorizing and storing spells away for instant use like an bunch of .exe files. Control and pretty much anything that requires conscious effort was all on me, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'in other words I'm nothing more than a memory bank or a hard drive huh?'</span></p><p><i>'Pretty much.'</i> I have to say being able to pick your brain like this has its advantages, it's like constantly having a study buddy you can bounce ideas with. But still an extremely loud mouthed bent on driving me crazy type of buddy. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Remind you of anyone?'</span></p><p>But even though I was making tremendous progress I was also losing sleep and my performance during our sessions which, on several occasions, have caused some level of property damage. So she decided to confiscate all the books from my room and locked my inside and ordered me to sleep. I just ended up practicing again behind her back, though I had to be careful since I have a limited amount of magic left as well as trying to keep my chains from making too much noise. Which I'm starting to get annoyed with, I even tried using a silence spell on them but they repelled the magic away. Or to be more accurate 'bounced' of and hit me in the face, I spent the next day unable to make a sound much to Twilight's great enjoyment. So I hit her with it as well.</p><p>Today Twilight decided to take a break from the usual exercise and brought me out to the castle garden in order to do an experiment. I have to admit the change of scenery was refreshing, and due to their limited reliance on technology Equestria's air was amazingly fresh and clean without all the pollution, despite being a major city.</p><p>&quot;Twilight are you sure about this? I don't wan't to get into trouble with Celestia again.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It's fine Rodney, I still want to know why your raw magic has such a unique reaction than anypony else. It shouldn't have exploded like that unless it was meant to. Besides the garden is due for renovation next week and there's no place else to safely study it, this is my only chance!&quot;</p><p>&quot; 'My' only chance? So this is just you satisfying your curiosity at my own expense?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Don't be silly of course not. It's for your benefit too, the more we know about your magic the better.&quot; Twilight had turned around and walked away as she said this, probably to avoid looking at me in the eye. </p><p>&quot;Whatever.&quot; even if she was just just giving excuses it still was still made sense. Not only does my magic look different from everyone else, but it was also never technically my magic to begin with. So there's bound to be some differences with 'normal' magic, I don't want to blow up my face while trying to magically shave in the morning......what? Believe me if you discover you can do magic you'd start doing just about everything with it, and I mean <i>everything!</i></p><p>&quot;Ok, I'm ready.&quot; Twilight had decided to move several feet away from the danger zone, primarily me.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Let's just get this over with, the sooner the faster we can get back on that shield spell.'</span> So after a few deep breaths to mentally prepare myself, I reached inwards and created the same azure ball of fire as before. No matter how many times I see my own magic materialize I still have to mentally remind myself that this wasn't a dream. I turned to Twilight who had a wall of translucent purple wall in front of her and gave me a nod. I tossed the ball of magic up several times and catching it again, each time I see Twilight flinching thinking it was going to explode, too bad she didn't know I had experimented with a smaller version of it before. Don't worry it was the size of a seed and the explosion was similar to a cherry bomb, I just told the guards I let one rip when they checked what was causing the racket. One of the benefits of being an alien, no one actually knows what your bowel movement actually sound like. </p><p>&quot;Just toss it already!&quot; I gave her a mischievous smile which she returned with a glare. I grabbed the ball in both hands behind me and took a sideways position, then I winded up and threw the thing just like a baseball pitcher would. Now, <i>maybe</i>, had I been asleep longer and had a bit more clarity in mind I would remember that even though I could 'feel' my magic which felt similar to weight, it does not have <i>physical</i> weight. On second though it might not even have a physical body making air resistance mean jack-shit, the results were pretty much similar to a moon with really low gravity.</p><p>Both Twilight and I traced the fireball as it flew across the garden while gaining altitude and went beyond the garden walls. It soared across the castle courtyard and before long I was able to predict it's trajectory, which was an open window high up in the main castle wall. It went perfectly right between the opening and into the room inside, just before the explosion shattered the window I noticed was painted glass mostly of deep blue with a large crescent moon in ghostly white and stars adorning around it, <i>'aw fuck my life.'</i>. Memories of younger days playing baseball with the neighborhood kids resurfaced and my mind instantly went back to the same mind set as a kid. </p><p><b>&quot;RUUUUUUUUN!!!!&quot;</b></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>I spent the next two hours running away from Luna and her night guards, which were pretty much a nocturnal version of Celestia's day guard. How they were able to have bat wings and lizard eyes though were a mystery, I even thought they were a different species entirely. Fortunately I wasn't alone, Twilight was also tagging along. She was so shocked and confused her mind went blank that she actually ran with me like a partner in crime. By the time she realized what happen it was too late, especially since Luna saw the both of us running away together. Try as we might it can't go on forever, eventually one of the kitchen staff decided to clean the chimney, which we were both hiding in.</p><p>&quot;It was all her idea!&quot; I shouted with a finger pointed at Twilight.</p><p>&quot;No it not! <i>Your</i> threw it into her room!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because Twirly Sprinkles here told me to do it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Twilight Sparkle</i>, and I told you to toss it BUT nooooo you had to-&quot;</p><p><b>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot;</b> both of us cringed at Luna's booming voice, I still have no idea how she does that. Luna was looking absolutely pissed at the both of us from her throne, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'actually to us mostly.'</span> And with good reason I suppose, some of her mane was still smoking somewhat and her tail was visibly shorter. We were at the throne room which were currently unused since Celestia had gone out to some other city somewhere. So it was just Luna on her throne while Twilight and myself were standing in the middle of the room still covered in chimney dust, oh and surounded by night guards all glaring at us, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">actually, it was entirely on us.</span></p><p>&quot;I'm so sorry about everything Princess. It was an accident, honest.&quot; Twilight was looking down at her hooves, head low and avoiding Luna's eye. </p><p>&quot;Then why did thou not simply admit to your mistake? We had expected our sister's prized student to more responsible and willing to accept mistakes openly. Were we wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not your Highness! I just...well I...please, I didn't mean to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was all my fault Luna.&quot; I can't stand to see Twilight like that anymore, despite how irritating and down-right creepy she can be, she has done nothing wrong. For crying out loud shes been doing nothing but help me learn magic, being a student to the supreme ruler has got to be taxing yet she stayed to help me. It's about time I gave something back.  Luna looked at me straight in the eye with a glare that could make newborns stand up and run in fear. But I didn't falter and kept firm under her gaze, this was the right thing to do. &quot;Twilight was most likely caught in the confusion and shock to properly think accurately, seeing me frantically running and screaming to follow made it worse. So please, leave her out of any form of punishment and please don't tell Celestia about this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why should we not inform our sister of your actions? Do you fear she would permanently imprison you in the castle? Considering your destructive nature we expect her to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You misunderstand me, I don't really care if Celestia knows. What I ask is that you don't mention Twilight's role in it, you can say whatever you wish regarding me.&quot; Twilight was looking at me open mouthed with small tears in her eyes. &quot;Oh please Twilight don't give me that look, I'm repaying you for everything you did for me. Besides after mentioning how amazing Celestia is during all our breaks I can easily guess how much you worship her. Besides even if Celestia decide to keep me locked up here in the castle, its not like I got other places to be. Really the castle is the only place I know and pretty much home already.&quot; Twilight's look shifted from thankful to sympathy, which was worse so I just avoided looking at her. </p><p>&quot;Be warned Rodney, although thou claims it was an accident. Thou still assaulted and harmed a member of royalty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh please all you got was a few burnt-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot;</p><p>*deep-breath* &quot;I mean. Yes Princess, I understand.&quot; I silently mouthed the words 'thank you' to Twilight. Silence fell in the room as Luna was contemplating the situation and her decision, the tension must be getting to Twilight as she started to sweat heavily to a point where her mane started to reflect the light. </p><p>&quot;Everypony, please vacate the room. We wish to speak privately.&quot; hesitantly all the night guards started to leave the throne room one by one. &quot;You too dear Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please Princess it was-&quot; Luna shot her a stern look which quickly stole her resolve and she slowly followed the guards. I hear the giant double doors shut, I was alone with Luna. </p><p>*tingle-tingle* <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Dude they're scared again.'</span></p><p><i>'I know I feel them too.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney, what does thou wish for?&quot; at first it sounded like I was blackmailing her or something.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What does thou want? Thou claim to have no place to be, then if freedom were offered thou would still remain in the castle?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess. But I don't plan on freeloading, I'll try to find something to help around with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's it? No ambition or dreams? Nothing that gives thou a need to excel other than simple curiosity?&quot; she was right. I was too preoccupied with magic and learning it's secrets, but is that enough? What should I do after? With everything that happened I didn't realize how I lost more than just my home and family, I lost my dream. Sure I could remain in the castle learning magic but as much as I enjoy them their ultimately just driven by curiosity, not ambition. </p><p>&quot;I...I don't know.&quot; silence fell again as I was still deep in thought and so was Luna.</p><p>&quot;Rodney, before thou came to our world, what was your dream then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's easy, to be a video game developer.&quot; one of Luna's brow rose in confusion. &quot;Basically I create something that entertains, that can bring someone to entire worlds of imagination and adventure. Much like a story would but far more immersible.&quot; </p><p>&quot;That's quite a dream, we are very interested in experiencing such a thing. Can thou not continue here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would say it's impossible but you have magic here, so from my standpoint pretty much anything can happen. But I <i>seriously</i> doubt it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And is there nothing else? We are unsure about you'r way of life but here it is common to find ponies that posses more than a single dream.&quot;</p><p><i>'Actually, yea there is.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Our retirement plan.'</span></p><p>&quot;Once, I had the pleasure of meeting an amazing man who gave me some advice. He said that once I achieve my dream and live it, I should help future generation reach theirs. That after making my mark in video games, I can continue to help it grow by planting the seeds in future generation.&quot; I took a deep breath and as I exhaled it felt like all the worry and fear from earlier came out with it. I looked up at Luna with a confident and determine smile as my ambitions were rekindled, &quot;Luna, I want to be a teacher.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A teacher?&quot; by the look on her face she was not expecting to hear something so noble. </p><p>&quot;Originally it was a retirement plan, and I would be teaching and helping others with the same dream as I have achieve as well. However, even if I won't be teach what I wanted to originally, it's still something I want to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is a remarkable dream, both Celestia and I have always had respect for those that live their lives to better the future. And what better place to start than with those that come after, that is why Celestia has opened her school in the first place. We are pleased with thy choice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you Luna, in all honesty I was also quite surprise with my choice.&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;That is because it was thy heart that spoke, not you.&quot;</p><p><i>'Thank god it wasn't something else that spoke.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Hey!'</span></p><p>&quot;Perhaps, in any case I have a lot to think about. Am I excused?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nice try Rodney,&quot; <i>'dammit.'</i> &quot;Does thou think we forget?&quot; I was really hoping our heartfelt conversation would make her forget that whole issue.</p><p>*sigh* &quot;It was worth a shot, so what's my punishment? Cleaning the floor? Building you a new furniture?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who does thou take us for? We are not as lenient as our sister. But don't worry, our punishment will not be so <i>physical.</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ooooookay...so what is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite simple, thou will not eat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Go to bed hungry?&quot; <i>'way too good to be real.'</i></p><p>&quot;Correction, thou will not eat meat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait  a minute! You actually got some already!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And until we deem thou shall not consume any of it.&quot; she might as well dangle a bottle of water in front of me in the desert.</p><p>&quot;Luna. That's cold.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: So after attending a party consisting of Pinkie, myself, my shovel &quot;Mr. Dugg&quot;, a roll of hose &quot;Miss Longnose&quot;, and the bronze head from statue in the park &quot;Colonel Heads-a-lot&quot;, she seem to have calmed down a bit. So with my freedom I immediately made a call to three different girl scout cookies to bring all the cupcakes and sugar treats they have in stock. Funny thing though, it came with a card that says &quot;Invite us to the next party.&quot;</p><p>Anyways, I'm finally getting the ball rolling with this chapter. I could push it a bit faster but that went too far to the way I write. Also I pushed myself to finish this chapter despite my busy schedule so there might be some errors here and there, sorry about that. It was also a pain to write Luna's script in old english, if anyone notices something wrong please comment below. Actually even if you don't please comment as well, I love reading them. </p><p>So enjoying yourself there Pinkie?</p><p>Pinkie: Nom nomomnom *gulp* *inhale* Nom nom nom...</p><p>Wait is that a fudge cupcake? Can I have-</p><p>Pinkie: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkYRIgXxITk" rel="nofollow"><b>Graagrrr!</b> *deep-growl* <b>GRAAAGH!</b></a></p>

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 10 - You'll never take me alive</p><p>AN: Naming ponies is hard.</p><hr/><p><i>'Well it's food so it's probably in the kitchen.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney...&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'But Luna did say she was going to personally keep it hidden.'</span></p><p>&quot;Rodney...&quot;</p><p><i>'So what? You think she actually has it in her room?'</i></p><p>&quot;<b>RODNEY!</b>&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Were you even listening to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what did I just say?&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;You want us to be ready and in our best attitude for Celestia when she comes back.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh, I guess you were listening.&quot;</p><p><i>'Thanks.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'No problem.'</span></p><p>After our little fiasco with Luna, and the banishment of meat from the menu, we decided to just play it cool and forgo practical training for the day and hit the books. However even the prospect of learning magic couldn't stop me from thinking about that big, juicy slab of meat hiding somewhere in this blasted castle. My mind became so distracted Twilight decided to just end our session early, seeing as I'm not making any progress. However it was still just midday and the idea of being stuck in my room for the rest of the day doesn't sound all that pleasant, especially when I have a voice constantly telling me to go on a hunt. I need a distraction.</p><p>&quot;Hey Twilight is it ok if I hang out with you today?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What brought this on?&quot; I shrugged. &quot;I wouldn't mind but I plan on doing some errand outside the castle, and it's probably going to take the entire day, sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok Twilight, I just didn't want to end up wasting time in my room is all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why don't you try exploring the castle?&quot; I looked down at Twilight with confusion, which she returned just as much. I threw a thumb over my shoulder to the two guards standing behind me. &quot;What about them? Wait, did you think you were a prisoner or something?&quot; I raised both my arms to show her my chains. &quot;That's not what I meant, well not most of it. Rodney you may be limited to the castle grounds but it's not like your a prisoner in here, your free to go wherever you want. Their there to make sure you don't do anything stupid.&quot;</p><p>*facepalm* &quot;Are you telling me I was never restricted to my room?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, except for that time you blew up the castle wall, but yes your allowed to go where ever you wish in the castle.&quot; Twilight ears suddenly fell flat and she started to poke the floor nervously. &quot;Did I not tell you that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>No </i>Twilight, you did not.&quot; I gave her look of irritation.</p><p>&quot;Oh hehehe, sorry.&quot; I kept glaring down at her while she had a hoof rubbing the back of her head. &quot;Kaygottagobye!&quot; before she even finished talking she was already galloping down the hallway kicking dust into the air. </p><p>&quot;I'm gonna get you for this Twilight!&quot; my voice echoed down the hallway chasing the purple unicorn. I turned and look to my two escorts, &quot;Neither one of you thought to tell me this?&quot; again nothing but hard stares were their answer. <i>'Course not, why should they when it makes their job easier.'</i> With nothing else stopping me I let my feet lead the way and started to explore the castle, who knows maybe I'll actually end up in the kitchen. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later...]</p></div><p><i>'This is not the kitchen.'</i> I don't know how but despite not climbing any stairs I had ended up on a balcony high up in the castle over a a different side of the gardens. Though it wasn't all bad, the view from the balcony was breathtaking and I felt a sense of calmness wash over me as I breathe in the fresh air and feel calm winds blowing about. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'A tenderloin steak would go nice with this.'</span></p><p>&quot;Goddammit man! I just forgot about that!&quot; the guards gave the slightest confused look but I didn't care. I threw my arms up in exasperation and sent them over the railing, I hung my face down in suffering wishing to god for something to happen. I picked my self up and leaned over the railing taking in the scenery again, hoping it would take me away a second time. That's when I heard a voice shouting down below, it took me a while to find the source with all the echo but eventually my sights fell on a pearl white unicorn with blonde mane sitting by a table laden with plates and a single tea cup with his back towards me. </p><p><i>'B</i><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">l</span><i>u</i><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">e</span><i>b</i><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">l</span><i>o</i><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">o</span><i>d.'</i> I didn't even care how my thoughts became jumbled up like that. He was giving some mare a hard time probably over some bullshit reason just so he can run his mouth. The mare was wearing a maid outfit and was holding up a pitcher with both front hooves while standing on her rear. Even from this distance I could tell from her quivering that she was either in pain or having a really hard time standing in a position she's clearly not meant to, all the while getting crap from Blueblood. The maid looked familiar and I realized it was the same one that I pranked several days ago, although we might not be on the best relationship she definitely didn't deserve to suffer like that. </p><p>It took me a while to prevent myself from using all my magic reserve to just chuck a giant fireball on his over sized head and end him right there. After some deep breaths and careful planning, I folded my arms across my chest while still leaning on the railing with my elbows with my back facing the guards. While I was pretending to enjoy the view and keeping my head looking straight, my eyes were looking down on my target. I used the thumb and index finger in my right hand to mock a pistol all the while keeping it covered from view with my body. I focused the tinniest amount of raw magic on the tip of my finger where a small azure fireball formed, it was only the size of an apple seed but it should be enough. Since magic has little to no air resistance and was literally weightless there was no need to calculate any trajectory, I only had to point it like a laser. It only took a short while to weave a simple launching spell that activates by my thumb which I place it on my hand setting burning with small azure flames. With the spell ready and the fireball in place, I took aim and fired.</p><p><i>'Burn Blueblood.'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Five seconds earlier, in the garden.....]</p></div><p>&quot;...this <i>thing</i> you call tea is simply horrific! You should be accused for attempted murder of the royal family. How auntie Celestia deems to keep your ilk around the castle is simply beyond me. Why I should-&quot; much of the world was lost to Blueblood at this moment, he was too deep in his tirade to notice anything around him. Not even to the maid's quivering hooves as she continue to keep up her balance while carrying a pitcher full of tea with her front hooves. Most ponies could only stand on their rear hooves for roughly fifteen minutes tops, she's been at it for twenty while holding a liter of liquid. She was sweating profusely and already past her limit, but she didn't dare to drop the pitcher for it would only cause her to suffer more under the prince's unrelenting insults. </p><p>Her vision was blurred as she squinted in effort and pain, however for the briefest moment she saw a flash of blue somewhere in her vision. She assume it was either the light's playing tricks or the exhaustion and pain was starting to make her see things. Several seconds later she saw smoke start to rise and for a moment believed it came from somewhere in the garden, however upon closer inspection the smoke was rising far closer than she thought. </p><p>&quot;Uhm, your Highness...&quot;</p><p>&quot;How dare you interrupt me, a member of the royal family by nothing more than a plebeian such as you! A serf for that matter! For a commoner like you to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please your Highness there's-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You dare to interrupt me again!? That's it, once auntie Celestia returns from Philidelphia I will personally inform her about this and...... *sniff-sniff* Ugh, what is that awful stench?&quot; using one of his front hooves to cover his nose he looked around for the source of the odor. He turned his head to look behind him and his vision was instantly covered in black smoke, after shaking his head about in an attempt to clear his vision he looked down to the source. His tail was on fire.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back on the balcony.....]</p></div><p>As much as I tried I only lasted three seconds before I started laughing my ass off over the balcony, it was too much. Seeing that pompous prick running around the garden with his tail burning and trailing smoke was like seeing my childhood cartoon come to life. The funny thing was that his tail had been groomed so much, it was all silky and light which made the fire burn faster and bigger. I don't know if it was because Blueblood was in panic or too stupid to realize that there was a small pool in the middle of the garden he could've used, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I'd say stupid.'</span> </p><p>Two guards rushed out from a nearby archway towards Blueblood where one of them actually tackled him to the dirt while the other immediately started to trample his tail to put the fire out. The scene only made me fall on the floor clutching my sides as the pain of laughter intensified. I was finally able to recover enough to pick myself up from the floor and lean over the railing to see the servant mare looking absolutely speechless at me, her face was somewhere between confusion and relief. I stood up and started to brush of the dust from my clothes then placed my right hand over my lips and blew her a kiss. </p><p>&quot;<b>YOU!</b>&quot; I turned to see a dirt covered, smoking Blueblood looking up at me. </p><p>&quot;Hey there Blueblood, what's cooking?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You did this didn't you!&quot; he pointed an accusing hoof at me.</p><p>&quot;Moi?&quot; I put my left arm across my chest and put on a mock expression of surprise. &quot;Perish the thought! Besides, how can I?&quot; </p><p>&quot;You used magic!&quot; he shouted.</p><p>&quot;Weren't you the one that said the monkey didn't have the skill nor finesse to learn the subtle arts of magic?&quot; I asked with a mocking tone. </p><p>&quot;Enough! Guards seize him!&quot; I turned to see the two earth pony guards started running at me. </p><p>&quot;Oh crap.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later, in the castle's hangar.....]</p></div><p>Princess Luna was sitting patiently between two of her night guards just below the archway of a large balcony used as the entryway for chariots. Though it was extremely late in the morning Luna refused to sleep in order to greet her sister home from her trip. She saw Celestia's chariot shinning in the sky several minutes ago and immediately made her way to the castle hangar, by the time she got there Celestia was already making her approach to land on the balcony. The sound of wood hitting metal followed by the many hoof steps signaled the chariot's landing.  </p><p>&quot;Sister! Tis good to see thee again. We hope the trip to Philidelphia was a success?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you for greeting us Luna, and yes it was. Construction of the new railroad should begin soon. Should you not be in bed by now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tis nothing in order to welcome thee home sister.&quot; Celestia gave Luna a loving nuzzle for her thoughtfulness. </p><p>&quot;Thank you Luna that very generous of you. Tell me though, how is out guest-&quot; but before she could finish one of doors in the large hangar burst open as a human came running through the opening towards another door on the opposite side. No, not running, he was <i>sliding</i> across the floor while his feet were wrapped in blue fire. Before Celestia could come into terms with the situation she heard what sounded like a stampede and soon enough she saw a long line of guards galloping together like a train, chasing the human down. Celestia and Luna just stood there speechless with their mouths agape as the parade passed by, off in the distance the princesses could hear someone screaming.</p><p>&quot;YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!!&quot; the two alicorns face-hoofed and could feel the signs of a headache looming. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later, in the throne room....]</p></div><p>The entire ordeal made me realize how long I've been laying on my ass, the feeling of exhaustion and adrenaline pumping in my veins was a refreshing change. As interesting as magic was it's way too passive and didn't include enough physical exertion to keep me in shape. At first I was able to use the hallways and windows to dodge them by making tight turns and such, but it couldn't last and eventually they caught up to me. It was quite impressive how fast I implemented a magnet spell to work on my feet at the last second all the while under duress, even more so that I got it to work like roller blades. The spell was only supposed to be an experiment to see if it;s possible to replicate properties of real world elements with magic, never did I thought I could use it to make myself a human maglev train.</p><p>But not knowing the layout of the castle was too much of a disadvantage, my luck eventually ran out and I hit a dead end. Which is I am now standing in the throne room, surrounded by guards with Celestia and Luna up on their throne along with Blueblood standing some distance to the right. Now considering what I've done you would expect me to take the situation a bit more serious, and I was, really I tried. But.....</p><p>*pfft*</p><p>&quot;Rodney.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Celestia?&quot; *snicker*</p><p>&quot;You have been,&quot;</p><p>&quot;pfft&quot;</p><p>&quot;...accused of,&quot;</p><p>*bites lip* &quot;mmph&quot;</p><p>&quot;...assaulting Prince,  *sigh* just get it out already.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you Celestia. Bwahahaaaaa! Hahahahahaha!&quot; I keeled over to my knees clutching my sides. Blueblood had attempted to salvage whatever was left of his tail, which wasn't much. All that's left was just a stump of hair sticking out of his butt with burnt ends that curled about making it look like an miniature afro, it made it look like he had an over sized tail of a black rabbit, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">or a giant black broccoli.</span> I could see Blueblood seething with anger and rage with every laughter, I even notice several guards smirking here and there. Eventually though my laughter started to infect everyone in the room, first Luna started to giggle which caused her two night guards to follow suit. Withing seconds after that  the room was filled with the sound of laughter and giggles as everyone on present started to join in my mirth. Which made Blueblood scowl even more and the sight of the angry Prince with the bunny tale only made me laugh ever louder. </p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Blueblood shouted and instantly the intensity of the laughters died until only my snickering and Luna's muffled giggles could be heard.</p><p>&quot;Now then.&quot; though Celestia's voice was hard and firm, her lips was still curve up in a humored smile. &quot;Rodney you have been accused of assaulting Prince Blueblood. How do you plea?&quot; I was still taking in labored breaths from both the chase and the laughter, I didn't even bother to get up. So while lying on my back to the floor I looked up at both Princesses.</p><p>&quot;Not guilty.&quot; I answered with a smile that showed my pearly white teeth. </p><p>&quot;You dare to lie in front of royalty? You set my tail on fire! I know you did!&quot; still smiling I turned to Blueblood. </p><p>&quot;Your proof?&quot; I asked with a raised brow, Blueblood gave a cocky smile.</p><p>&quot;I have a witness!&quot; he declared. <i>'Shit.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'It was probably one of the guards with us on the balcony.'</span></p><p>Blueblood signaled to one of the guards by the door who immediately pushed the door open. I had expected to see one of the earth pony guards to step in but was surprised to see a maid slowly making her way into the throne room. It was the same light-brown mare that Blueblood was giving crap to earlier in the garden. She took nervous steps towards the Princesses all the while looking down to the floor only to lift her head to throw me several worried looks. Eventually she made her way to stand beside me where her shacking got worse and she was starring intently to the floor in front of her. </p><p>&quot;This serf was with me when the monkey committed his crime. She was at the perfect location with the perfect view of the event</p><p>&quot;What is your name my little pony?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Shine Bright you majesty.&quot; she didn't dare to look up to Celestia and instead bowed low as she answered.</p><p>&quot;Don't be afraid Shine Bright, I promise your not in any trouble.&quot; Celestia spoke in a warm motherly voice which seem to calm the mare enough to stop shaking and even glanced up at the princess. &quot;Now my dear, please tell us what you saw.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I was serving the Prince with his tea when it happen.&quot; <i>'more like suffering under him.'</i> &quot;He was was, eh <i>'informing'</i> me how I could better myself in my station.&quot; she was trying her best to avoid looking at Blueblood.</p><p>&quot;Is that what you call being degraded and insulted?&quot; I interjected.</p><p>&quot;Insolent monkey! I will have you sent to the deepest dungeon to which you will-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Silence both of you!&quot; Blueblood shot me a look of murder while I gave him one that spoke 'who gives a fuck?'. &quot;Now then, you were saying?&quot; all attention shifted back to Shine as she continued to speak.</p><p>&quot;Uhm...well, while the Prince was <i>busy</i> with me I saw something flash behind him.&quot; at that I suddenly felt a large lump start to build up in my throat.</p><p>&quot;It was the monkey wasn't it! That fiend did something and set my tail on fire!&quot; Celestia was about to reprimand Blueblood a second time but Shine continue to speak.</p><p>&quot;Uh actually, I saw the royal pet flying over and well...&quot; she looked down to the floor avoiding everyone's eyes. &quot;I saw her drop a <i>bomb</i> on the Prince's tail.&quot; although I wasn't sure what she was talking about I suddenly felt an urge to hug the mare. She had just lied to both the Princesses for my sake. </p><p>&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Blueblood shouted in disbelief. </p><p>&quot;I-I tried to warn the Prince but he wouldn't let me-&quot;</p><p>&quot;She lies! It was him behind this! I know it, it has to be! They must be in cahoots together. Yes that's it, they were working together in an attempt to-&quot; before Blueblood could finish showing everyone his level of stupidity, Luna interrupted.</p><p>&quot;That's enough cousin. Clearly this has all been nothing more but a misunderstanding.&quot; Blueblood look to Luna with his eyes wide in shock in disbelief. He was about to speak again but Celestia beat him to the punch. </p><p>&quot;Quite, I will have to talk to Philomena to take care where she does her <i>business</i> in the future. You are free to go Shine Bright.&quot; as Celestia gave Shine a nod she glanced to me for a second before trotting of in hastily, more that glad to leave. </p><p>&quot;Bu-but Auntie Celestiaaa.&quot; <i>'my god he's actually starting to whine like a baby.'</i></p><p>&quot;Perhaps Blueblood, next time it will be best to have your tea time, indoors.&quot; maybe it was the way she spoke or something but for a moment Celestia sounded like she was trolling, and enjoying it. Blueblood looked back and forth between Celestia and Luna before finally looking down at me with anger and frustration. I gave him a middle finger and although he might not get the meaning, the intent of the gesture wasn't lost to him. </p><p>Eventually he had enough and started to trot away with his nose held high, however it seemed that Blueblood had taken to walk with a style that allowed him to show off his tail. But now with his tail being too short to do anything but stick out like a stump it gave everyone a perfect few of his rear swaying about in a very unmanly like fashion, causing everyone in the room and especially the guards to giggle and snicker again. He gave a frustrated grunt and started to walk faster which only made his rear movements all the more noticeable. While most were trying to control their mirth, Luna and I were laughing our ass off again, I guess she's not so bad <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'when shes not trying to obliterate your junk.'</span></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>&quot;Well, that was entertaining. Is it ok if I go now?&quot; after exploring most of the day, running around from the guards, and laughing more that I can remember, I was just wanted to go to bed. </p><p>&quot;Actually there is something else I would like to discuss with you Rodney.&quot; Celestia pointed to a door nearby and I followed her and Luna into what appear to be a simple resting area with large pillows laid about. Celestia and Luna sat next to each other while I sat crossed legged atop a pillow across from them.  		</p><p>&quot;Ok so what's this about? Am I still in trouble?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Thou has nothing to fear. In fact we believe thou will enjoy it.&quot; before I was able to question further the door open and I saw Twilight enter the room. Upon seeing her mentor Twilight trotted up and started to nuzzle her affectionately before taking a site next to her. </p><p>&quot;Rodney, Luna has informed me about how you wish to one day become a teacher, is this true?&quot; Twilight's eyes shot wide open and she looked at me questioningly. </p><p>&quot;That's right Celestia, although I haven't really figured out <i>what</i> I'll be teaching. Probably some math considering my skills. It was originally something I planned to do when I retire, but seeing as my original life ambition is longer applicable in this world, I decided on the next best choice.&quot; by now Twilight was beaming at me and clapping her hooves together. </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh that's wonderful Rodney! You can teach us all about your world and technology. Think how much it could help Equestria.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry Twilight but I don't plan on improving anything. Even if I want to I don't really know much about how most technology in my world actually works. Although I may not know much about this world, I can tell that it's an amazing place and I don't want to accidently throw it off balance by injecting technology your not ready yet.&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'like nukes,'</span> &quot;Maybe a little health care or medicine to improve living conditions but it's best to let you guys progress on your own. And since you guys got magic it could easily outdo my world at one point.&quot; although Twilight looked disappointed she also appear to understand my reasoning which seem to have surprised Celestia. </p><p>&quot;That's very wise of you Rodney, I honestly didn't see that coming, it's a pleasant surprise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey just because I don't act like it doesn't mean I don't know how to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's an interesting thought. In any case the reason I asked was because I wanted to help you fulfill you new ambition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And exactly how are you going to go about doing that?&quot; this time Luna answered.</p><p>&quot;Knowledge can be easily accessed and learned from a book or scroll. Being a teacher requires more than just knowledge, they must also be able to understand their disciples and guide them in life should they need to. Thou may already have the necessary knowledge to teach however thou lacks everything else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Luna is correct, in order to be somepony who can guide other's in life, they must first have sufficient experience in it. Rodney although our world may share a great deal of similarity with your's, it also has a great deal of difference. In order for you to better understand life in Equestria we have decided to let you live outside the castle.&quot; it took a moment for the message to sink in. Their really serious about helping me and their right too, I'm only twenty-four years old which even in my world is still considered young. Now I'm stuck in a world that could easily live by very different morals and ideals, <i>'hell these guys don't even eat meat.'</i> </p><p>&quot;Wait a minute, what about me controlling my abilities and not accidently shooting of magic randomly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Based on Twilight's reports I believe you are sufficiently trained to keep everypony safe from any <i>unintentional</i> magic casting.&quot; I didn't like how she emphasized that word. &quot;Not many know this but my pet does not leave any excrement.&quot; she gave me a wink. <i>'Oh god she knows!'</i> &quot;You see phoenixes completely incinerate their food during digestion, all that's left is ash.&quot; <i>'Wait...............what?'</i></p><p>&quot;We too believe thou'st well prepared to venture out from the castle. However that does not mean we trust you completely.&quot; Luna's eyes narrowed as she paused to let the words sink into my thick skull. &quot;And thus we are sending thee somewhere close, it's a small village called Ponyville. It is also where Twilight Sparkle currently resides before thou arrived in Equestria, that way she can continue to oversee thou progress.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it really called 'Pony' ville?&quot; </p><p>&quot;What's wrong with it?&quot; Twilight looked a bit peeved at the way I asked. </p><p>&quot;Well it just sounded so.........unoriginal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well that's what its called ok so deal with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Woa hey it's cool. I mean sure why not, it's simple and precise.&quot; she must really like this place.</p><p>&quot;So Rodney, what do you think?&quot; I looked at Celestia and down to the floor as I started to contemplate their proposal. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well for one we can finally get out of this place.'</span></p><p><i>'And what about living expenses, I mean sure Celestia could probably give Twilight some money to include out needs but that;s the same as freeloading.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Then just get a job there, I don't see the problem. The only reason you still have doubts about this is because your scared.'</span></p><p><i>'I'm not afraid.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'When are you going to learn that you can't keep things from me? Plus I know why, your about to go out into a world alien to you. Your also leaving the protection of the castle meaning, but there's a bright side.'</span></p><p><i>'Which is?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'No castle, no guards, meaning no one is keeping an eye on us 24-7. Which means that our chances of getting some meat just skyrocket!'</span></p><p>&quot;I'm in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excellent! You leave tomorrow.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: Phew this one took a while to finish. For those of you waiting to see Blueblood get his due I hope you enjoyed it. And now were finally having the mane six appear in the next chapter, at least I hope we do. </p><p>Now for some bad news, I'm going on a trip again and this time it's going to be longer than before and I don't know if I can continue to write. So I decided the chance to reflect and really think about how the story is going to progress. So again sorry about the delay. </p><p>And as usual please comment and criticize or point out some errors if you see any. </p><p>With that out of the way has anyone seen Pinkie? I haven't seen her since-what this?</p><p><i>Dear Zai,</i></p><p><i>Getting ready for Rodney's party. </i></p><p><i>Pinkie Pie</i></p><p><i>P.S Sorry I bit you, hope the ointment helps</i></p><p>Oh, well I guess that's- *turns the card around* </p><p><i>P.P.S I'm taking your 360.</i></p><p><b>PINKIE PIE!!!</b></p>

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 11 - Oh it is on like Donkey Kong</p><p>AN: Not enough time to edit as I want, so sorry for bad quality. What you expect I'm traveling.</p><hr/><p>I had thought that the prospect of leaving and venturing to places unknown would cause me to lose some sleep, yet strangely it was just another normal night. I'm probably just over exagirating about the 'unknown' part, its not like I'm going to the jungle or even be left alone. I'll expect it would be more like traveling to a different country or something, a cultural shock would probably be more or less the worse I'll experience, I hope. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'For crying out loud! They got magic, YOU'RE doing magic!. I seriously doubt that anything can fall under what we expect.'</span></p><p><i>'But you also can't deny the uncanny resemblance this world has with our own. Hell I don't even know how we're communicating with the same language. And do you really have to shoot down my every attempt to reassure myself?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Only when they can get us killed, or worse. So far we've only been living inside the castle of their leaders, which probably means we're in one of the safest place in this world. Now we're about to go out to a village, no walls and probably not enough guards to secure absolute the law completely. For all we know it could be as bad as the worst part of our city.'</span></p><p><i>'From what we've seen of them I seriously doubt we're gonna get mugged right-'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Do you really want to take that chance? Like I said, stupid ideas. DON'T get careless because their world resemble the happy dreams of a ten year old girl.'</span></p><p><i>'When did you get so morbid?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'How many times do I gotta remind you? I'm your id and your instinct, including your survival ones. Just don't get too careless ok? It's why we spent so much time on that shield spell.'</span></p><p><i>'Fine, and how goes it anyway? Any problems so far?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Too early to tell, it's on but it's dormant. Really the only way to tell is in actual situations when we need it.'</span></p><p><i>'In other words we'll find out when we're actually under attack? Wonderful.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Hey your the one who coded it, I just keep watch over it.'</span></p><p><i>'Too bad we can't make it big enough to cover me entirely.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">*sigh* 'Like I keep saying, it's too-'</span></p><p><i>'Yea yea I know, it's too taxing on our magical reserve thus leaving us completely drain and vulnerable. Making it counter productive.'</i></p><p>Which lead to another thought, I'm certain Twilight will continue to aid me in my training and research, but does that mean I'll always rely on her for my supply of magic? I know she's ok with it but it still feels....uncomfortable. Something I'll have to talk to her about later. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Again with the stupid ideas. Why do we have to make this an issue? Magic is pretty much our only ace in this world aside from draining it, we got no guns or anything to help us survive or fight so either we get it from someone OR we take it by force which would probably get us thrown in jail or worse. She's wiling to give it to us freely and you want to make this awkward and potentially cut of our safe and secure supply? WHY!?'</span></p><p><i>'It feels wrong! Why? I don't know but I do. You might have the luxury of being free of morals and ideals but I'm not!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Right back at you! Those things are a luxury! When it comes down to survival it's who live and who dies. Which one do you think I prefer?'</span> Correction, I didn't lose any sleep by the prospect of leaving the castle. Instead I spent a good three hours arguing with myself over the moral and immoral implications and outcomes of my actions, and how he thinks none of that matter. Yes I realize how it shows how far gone I've fallen over the deep end. </p><p>Which was why when I woke up the next day it was with an irritable and sour mood which, based on Twilight's question, was quite noticeable. </p><p>&quot;Is everything alright Rodney? Are you having second guesses about moving to Ponyville?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's nothing Twilight, I just found out I may potentially be a psychopath.&quot; Twilight pace suddenly slowed and stopped and I only noticed it when she suddenly disappeared from the corner of my vision. I looked back and she was looking at me with a bit of worry. *sigh* &quot;It's a joke Twily.&quot; I said flatly.</p><p>&quot;Oh, ok.&quot; her expression visibly relaxed and she galloped a bit to catch up to me. When we continue walking I noticed that her demeanor changed, by the looks of it she had something in mind. </p><p>&quot;What's up? Not like you to be lost in thought, at least not in the mornings.&quot; I ended in a joking matter.</p><p>&quot;Oh nothing, it's just that you called me Twily instead of my name.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that ok? I didn't mean anything bad by it, it's a human thing to give nicknames to people-er, ponies their friends with. I can stop if you want.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh no it's ok, we do that too. It's just the first time that you called me something other than my name, it just kinda got me by surprise. It's fine you don't have to stop if you prefer it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well ok then, I was kinda hoping you'd let me, it sounds cute.&quot; that last remark made Twilight blush a bit and she immediately found the floor we were walking on a lot more interesting than it should. It's also something that I've started to realize, with exception to certain ponies like Celestia and Luna, most are a lot more innocent and honest. Something we humans have lost a long time ago.</p><p>We continue walking in silence and eventually arrived at the hangar which completely went unnoticed the last time I was here considering the stampede I was running from. To say it was massive was an understatement, several football fields could easily fit in. It wasn't the kind of hangar that would house planes either, for one thing I doubt their anywhere close to that level of tech, but it was definitely for something that was flight worthy. The only thing that came to mind when considering the sheer volume of space needed was a blimp, or something of the like. </p><p>Eventually my gaze fell back down and I saw Celestia and Luna standing next to each close to a chariot, as usual both princesses were flanked by guards. We walked up to them where Twilight then started to bow in a similar fashion to ho cat's a dogs could stretch. </p><p>&quot;Celestia, Luna. What's up?&quot; although neither princess nor Twilight seem surprised or mind my casual greeting, the guards eyed me with some hostility. I gave them my trademark 'who gives a fuck' look. </p><p>&quot;Now Rodney remember what I said.&quot; despite Celestia's voice her expression showed that it was nothing more than a scolding a mother would give to her child. And I was the perfect little hellion when I was young. </p><p>&quot;Oh dear me how foolish of me to forget! Please, I deeply apologize from my lapse in judgment.&quot; I ended with the most over dramatic bow as I swung my right arm about with my left arm tucked behind me. </p><p>&quot;You're never going to stop with your antics are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hell's no.&quot; Celestia gave out a long sigh of defeat while Luna started to giggle in mirth. </p><p>&quot;In any case, are you ready?&quot; I tried to give an honest answer but I couldn't, so I jut shrugged. &quot;That's a good, shows you have given this some thought.&quot; we started to make our way to a large balcony outside and once it was close enough I threw the bag I've been carrying into the chariot. It was a large bag probably enough to pack most camping equipment, however it only carried the clothes I originally wore and the extras that the staff made for me. Shows how much of a fresh start this world has been. </p><p>It finally it came to that dreaded moment in every parting, that awkward moment when you don't really know what to do. Do I just say goodbye, shake a hoof, slap their flanks again? That last random thought sparked an idea in my head. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh fuck no!'</span></p><p><i>'Oh c'mon, it'll be the perfect test. It's much better than a field test.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And if it fails? I don't think our boys can handle another beating like that.'</span></p><p><i>'Trust me this'll work.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Do I have a fucking choice?'</span> however before I could initiate my plan.</p><p>&quot;Ehm, excuse me?&quot; I turned towards the voice and saw a maid standing by the entry way of the balcony. </p><p>&quot;Shine Bright?&quot; Celestia asked. She nodded and gave a bow just like Twilight. &quot;Is there something wrong my little pony?&quot; she didn't move and kept looking down, probably having second thoughts about whatever she was about to do, but she did glanced at me which Celestia noticed. &quot;Ah I see, Luna, Twilight offer them some privacy.&quot; with that they walked back into the hangar until only the guards, Shine and myself were left on the balcony. </p><p>&quot;So...&quot; there were some very awkward silence so I decided to start things off, whatever this was. &quot;Your name's Shine Bright eh?&quot; she nodded. &quot;I'm guessing that has something to do with your cutie-mark?&quot; she nodded again and bent sideways so that one of her front hooves could reach and lift a piece of clothing covering her flank. Her mark was an ivory white dish plate with gold lining around the edged, a star was etched on the top left of the plate mimicking how a clean plate would shine in the light. </p><p>&quot;I uh, I came to say thank you.&quot; even though it was meant for me, the way she spoke while looking down made it look like the floor was in on the conversation. </p><p>&quot;Thank you for.....?&quot;</p><p>&quot;With Prince Blueblood.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh, that. Heh it was nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it's not!&quot; she suddenly spoke up and was now looking at me straight in the eye, her shyness was completely gone. &quot;It was more than that, the staff and myself has always been treated badly by him but no one dares to do anything or report it since he's related to the Princess. But you did.&quot; small tears started to show around the corner of her eye which surprised me more than her sudden bravery. </p><p><i>'Why is she taking this so much? I mean I would've done it either way, it was just coincident that she was there.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I guess she had to deal with Blueblood a lot more than we thought.'</span></p><p><i>'True but is that all?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Shows how innocent these ponies are, to them being saved from a stuck up noble with enough ego to dwarf a nuclear reactor must be quite an achievement is like saving their life or something.'</span></p><p>&quot;Why do you let him treat you like that?&quot; Shine was a bit puzzled by this.</p><p>&quot;Uhm, because he' Princess Celestia's nephew.&quot; she said as if common sense.</p><p>&quot;It doesn't mean that he has the right to, or that you have to take it all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I felt a bit hesitant, after all I was about to teach her how to be a big enough jerk to topple someone in power, but Blueblood really has it coming. </p><p>&quot;Tell me, is Celestia a just ruler?&quot; again she looked at me funny like I was stupid and nodded. &quot;And how many staff is in the castle in charge of tending everyday life?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm, about two hundred and forty, excluding the kitchen staff.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait, there's two hundred and forty of you guys? Maids and butlers that deal directly with your employers?&quot; she nodded. <i>'Well fuck me this is a lot easier than I thought. Oh and pampered much?'</i> &quot;In other words it's going to be near impossible for someone to memorize every single member of the entire staff.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess, why does that matter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because my dear I'm about to teach you, and hopefully you would teach the entire staff, how to royally fuck Blueblood on a daily basis without any retribution.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Hells. Fucking. YES!'</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later....]</p></div><p>&quot;....and that's when you put ink in his tea, and the really strong stuff too so it stains for a month.&quot; over the past several minutes I had told her almost every single 'fuck the boss' prank that every employee has ever devised, though I kept some ideas involving bodily fluids cause that's just gross. I even noticed how the chariot was mysteriously closer than it was before, looks like the guards will have some fun as well. Too bad Celestia had to ruin the fun. </p><p>&quot;I'm sorry everypony, but we are on a schedule.&quot; Celestia emerge from the corner of the entry way. </p><p>&quot;It's alright Celestia, were done.&quot; <i>'and so is Blueblood.'</i></p><p>&quot;Yes Princess, than you for granting my selfish request. And <i>thank you</i> Rodney.&quot; with one of her hoof she beckoned me down so I crouched until I was just a foot or more taller than she is. She reached out and placed both her hooves around my neck and hugged me, which after getting over the surprise, did the same. Just when we were about to move apart she closed in again and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I looked at her n both confusion and more surprise as she just blushed beet red and practically jumped of me and galloped away in embarrassment. </p><p>*giggle* &quot;My Rodney, I didn't know you were so good with the mares.&quot; Celestia was expecting some rebuttal but I was still slacked jawed in disbelief. *laugh* &quot;Is that what it takes to get you in control? Perhaps I should follow suit.&quot; <i>that</i> got my attention.</p><p>&quot;Don't you freakin dare Celestia!&quot; but all that did as egg her on as she started to approach me with malicious intent in her eyes. I tried to stand up but I put too much effort which resulted in pushing my ass on the floor, Celestia nuzzle was now only inches away.  </p><p>&quot;Sorry, but your not my type.&quot; she said in a deep husky and sultry voice. </p><p><i>'Di-did I just got trolled by Celestia!?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'This means WAR!'</span></p><p>&quot;Is everything alright sister?&quot; Luna and Twilight made their way to us while looking somewhat worried and confused at our position. </p><p>&quot;It's nothing Luna, fret not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea Luna, everything is just dandy.&quot; I gave Celestia a look and a small smile that could only mean one thing, 'oh it is on like Donkey Kong'. She gave me one in return but there was something in her eye that spoke, 'bring it monkey'. We stared at each other, like adversaries in chess trying to get into each other's head even before anything has begone.</p><p>&quot;Uhm, Princess?&quot; Twilight's voice broke our little duel. I picked myself up while Celestia went to stand beside Luna again. &quot;Er, shall we then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I believe we've delayed you enough. Twilight please send my regards to the other elements of harmony please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And our too if you will.&quot; Luna added.</p><p>&quot;Of course your Highness.&quot; with another bow she jumped onto the chariot.</p><p>&quot;I guess I'll see you two later.&quot; and I too jumped in. </p><p>&quot;Fare thee well Rodney, and remember thou purpose in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will do Luna.&quot; both sisters took several steps back before turning around to head back in, I saw Luna's flank.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Dammit I was hoping you'd forget!'</span></p><p>With a smile I jumped back down to the balcony just as the chariot started to move and silently walked up behind Luna and carefully placed myself right behind her, I raised my hand and slapped her flank just as I did after our first encounter. As predicted her reflexes kicked in as she raised her left rear hoof ready and reared kicked me right at my groin. Three things occur, one there was a flash and blue sparks flew everywhere, two there was no excruciating pain from my balls, three I was flying backwards back into the chariot which pushed it over the edge of the balcony. Luckily the two pegasus was able to get the chariot in control and soon the we were flying up into the clouds. </p><p><b>&quot;RODNEY GET YOUR FLANK BACK HERE SO I CAN POUND IT TO THE GROUND!!&quot;</b></p><p>&quot;Rodney what the hay! Why did you do?&quot; Twilight mane was a bit frazzled as she tumbled about in the chariot. </p><p>&quot;Two things Twily, one I had successfully tested my magical crotch guard which was a blazing success, and two I made Luna angry enough to speak normally.&quot; I explained with a big smile while rubbing the back of my head as a lump had started to grow. &quot;Well, mostly successful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But why would you slap Princess Luna on her flank!?&quot; I shrugged as if it didn't matter. &quot;Ugh! I swear you bring nothing but trouble!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I love you too Twily.&quot; for a moment her face flashed beet red but when I flashed my teeth in a wide grin she just rolled her eyes and fell flat on her stomach, pulled out a book from her saddle bag and began reading as we continue to fly across the sky. I put my hands behind my head, leaned back and enjoyed the cool breeze as I make my way to Ponyville, my new beginning. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/d1960ea45bac3c0178b2747a91428e34ed10d195?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc07.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2012%2F219%2F1%2F6%2Fcustom_xbox_acievement___2__by_noxxels-d5a589d.jpg" /></p></div><p>AN: Yes I know, I did say the next chapter was going to include the mane six and all but I felt this chapter needed to make the transition easier.

<p><b>Shackles and Friendship</b><br/>Chapter 12 - Incoming D'awwwnuke!</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>AN: I found my cover art!</p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/d9c57a49ceb4aba3d763e5cdd5eb391a9789bf00?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giantbomb.com%2Fuploads%2F0%2F4800%2F186172-destroyman_large.jpg" /></p></div><hr/><p>If I could describe the ride to Ponyville in a single word, it would have to be peaceful. The breeze was cold but the sunshine kept us comfortably warm while creating an brilliant shine from behind the clouds, it was all simply perfect. At first my mind kept wondering about thinking what the town would be like, what will I be doing, and whether or not I'll have to kill something to get meat back into the menu. But eventually those worries melted away by the scenery and I fell into a sense of calm and peace. </p><p><i>'This I can get used to.'</i></p><p>I was ready to just sleep through the entire trip and losing myself in the windy sensation, but just as I was about to close my eyes the chariot flew over a hill revealing our destination. My opened wide as I took in the new scenery, it was every bit a peaceful town would and should be. The first thing I noticed were the great expanse of green dominating the area, with exception to the road there were plants, trees and grass everywhere, some even growing on the buildings themselves. Closest to us was a large red barn located some distance away from the town surrounded by a great number of apple trees which expanded several hills around. A river swiveled around through the town like a snake, its light blue water gave the scene a beautiful contrast from the dominant green. Most of the buildings appear to be houses of sort which were mostly white with yellow-orange roofing, they all appear to share a similar design with only subtle differences like balconies and overhangs. One building, a large three story building with several wooden beams around it, stood out from the rest making it look like a government building or mayor's office. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/2c9e00b330096da3255d0b663e354a570c7057a3?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimages3.wikia.nocookie.net%2F__cb57088%2Fmlp%2Fimages%2Fc%2Fc5%2FPonyville.png" /></p></div><p>And just when I thought it couldn't get any more perfect nature decided to add something extra, a bright colorful rainbow arced across the sky right on top of the peaceful town. Considering their level of technology as well as having magic, I had expected this world to retain most of it's natural environment. But this just made me realize how much humans have ravaged our home, I doubt there's any place left on earth that could even come halfway close to the beauty of this town or invoke the same feeling of peacefulness. </p><p>It wasn't an idea but more like a compulsion, before I even realize what I was doing I had begun to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_DKWlrA24k" rel="nofollow">hum a familiar tune.</a> </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[On the other side of the chariot....]</p></div><p>Twilight's ears perked up in attention when she heard something in the wind, at first she thought it was the wind blowing past her ear but it kept changing tone here and there. She looked away from the book towards the source of the sound, the human remain still as he kept looking at the view in front of him. It only took a second longer for Twilight to realize that the human was humming a tune, probably playing along a music in his head. Twilight didn't mind, in fact the tune was a pleasant change from the constant blur of wind blowing past her ears. It was when Twilight turned around to continue reading did the humming abruptly stopped only to be replaced by words as Rodney began to sing.</p><p><i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i></p><p><i>Way up high</i></p><p><i>And the dreams that you dreamed of</i></p><p><i>Once in a lullaby</i></p><p><i>Oh somewhere over the rainbow</i></p><p><i>Bluebirds fly</i></p><p><i>And the dreams that you dreamed of</i></p><p><i>Dreams really do come true</i></p><p><i>Someday I'll wish upon a star</i></p><p><i>Wake up where the clouds are far behind me</i></p><p><i>Where trouble melts like lemon drops</i></p><p><i>High above the chimney tops</i></p><p><i>That's where you'll find me</i></p><p><i>Oh somewhere over the rainbow</i></p><p><i>Bluebirds fly</i></p><p><i>And the dreams that you dare to</i></p><p><i>Oh why, oh why can't I?</i></p><p><i>Oh someday I'll wish upon a star</i></p><p><i>Wake up where the clouds are far behind me</i></p><p><i>Where trouble melts like lemon drops</i></p><p><i>High above the chimney tops</i></p><p><i>That's where you'll find me</i></p><p><i>Oh somewhere over the rainbow</i></p><p><i>Way up high</i></p><p><i>And the dreams that you dare to</i></p><p><i>Why, oh why can't I, I?</i></p><p>(AN: Thank you Isreal, and may you rest in peace.)</p><p>Somewhere during the music Twilight's gaze followed Rodney's towards the all too familiar view of her town.  Sure Twilight stared at the view of Ponyville the first time she came here, but to her it was mostly out of curiosity of new places. But now while listening intently to every word of the song, she saw her second home in a new light. Despite her adventures since she moved there the town was a peaceful place to live and certainly a wonderful change from the constant white and gray stones of Canterlot. Most importantly it was where she met her friends and learned the true meaning of friendship, but there was more to it. It was the small things that she had taken for granted in her everyday life like the pleasant greetings from neighbors and receiving smiles from ponies she didn't even really know. </p><p><i>'Why did it take so long for me to see it? Why did it take somepony like HIM to show it to me!?'</i> she turned her head and looked back at the human. Based on her experience, Rodney certainly had been a constant surprise with his skill and intellect but his method of speech and antics showed just how immature he can be. But there was nothing before that showed her anything about him being sensitive or anything of the like, it threw her impression of him completely of scale. <i>'Are all humans like that? Or was it just bad luck I got the odd one?'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back on the other side.....]</p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Requires use of imagination for rainbow.)</p></div><p>&quot;Uh Twily, why are you staring at me like that?&quot; after my impromptu concert returned back to my relaxing position where I notice Twilight had abandoned her book and was eyeing with a small squint. </p><p>*sigh* &quot;Nothing, just thinking about my luck.&quot; I raised an brow at her in confusion. &quot;Forget about it.&quot; I shrugged and leaned back with both hands behind my head. &quot;Anyway I didn't peg you as the singing type, was that a song from your world? It's beautiful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea it was, it's a simple song and pretty straight forward. Basically about finding, wanting and hoping to find a better place. When I saw the town I realized I fit all three.&quot; Twilight beamed at me.</p><p>&quot;I'm glad you like it, wait till we actually arrive. It's even better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By all means, do tell.&quot; Twilight started to describe the town and it's inhabitants, she started with her friends who I've met before the first time I arrived in this world but never really talked at all. I decided it was best to gather as much information about the town I'm going to be living in, plus it helped pass the time. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later....]</p></div><p>&quot;You're joking, a day spa? Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's wrong with a day spa?&quot; I looked down at her hooves and back up to her eye. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing, what ever works for you Twily. Though I'm starting to suspect you ponies like it rough.&quot; </p><p>&quot;And what does <i>that</i> suppose to-uff!&quot; the chariot jolted rocking us a bit as it made contact with the dirt road withing Ponyville. I stood up and weaved my head about taking in my new home for the foreseeable future. Everything looked simple and cozy, from the houses to the numerous stalls around the clearing the town was exactly what one would imagine in a medieval-fantasy video game. It would have been perfect if everyone in the vicinity wasn't staring at me and giving me odd looks. </p><p><i>'I guess that's to be expected, it's actually weird none of them are running away.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Look at it from their perspective, there's an unknown creature with chains wrapped around it's limbs riding in a royal chariot standing next to the Celestia's apprentice. We probably look more like a prisoner about to get interrogated.'</span> </p><p>&quot;Hey Twilight,&quot; she was already off the chariot and was trying to put on her saddlebag. &quot;you have told everyone about me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I did.&quot; she said flatly, I swung my arm in a broad sweep to indicate all the stares I was getting. &quot;Oh don't worry about them, it is your first time in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well if you say so.&quot; I looked back to the crowd and with a shrug picked up my bag and jumped of the chariot. &quot;So were to now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're going to library where I live, and I guess where you'll be living as well.&quot; <i>'of course she lives in a library.'</i> &quot;I've also sent a letter yesterday to my friends to meet us there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those other ponies I met in the forest?&quot; honestly I don't remember much from that encounter considering I thought I was high. </p><p>&quot;If we're lucky their already waiting in the library with Spike.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who's Spike? *cough*&quot; the chariot flew off kicking up some dust. </p><p>&quot;He's my number one assistant.&quot; and with that we started to make our way in silence as I take in the sights and try to familiarize myself with the town, and the stares. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later, in front of the library....]</p></div><p>&quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why is the library, which happen to be you-our home, a tree?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why what's wrong with it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let's see, a large supply of dry paper inside a flammale structure? You're just asking to get burned, <i>literally!</i>&quot; even I know not to mess with Murphy's Law.</p><p>&quot;Please Rodney who do you take me for, I <i>am</i> Princess Celestia's protege. I've cast enchantments to prevent fires and it even has a magical lightning rod installed in case of storms.&quot; I keep staring at the structure suspiciously. </p><p>*sigh* &quot;Course, magic.&quot; that's probably why its so large. Height wise it's not that much different from a normal tree but its width was gigantic, you can probably walk through some of thicker branches. Which was another thing, somehow despite having nearly having it entirely hollowed out the tree looked alive, in fact it looked perfectly healthy. <i>'Tree huggers back home is gonna shit themselves if they see this.'</i></p><p>While I was pondering the nature of the fucked up tree, Twilight had already opened the front door and walked in. </p><p>&quot;Spike, I'm hooome! Spike?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the kitchen Twilight!&quot; from his voice Spike sounded like a boy several years behind puberty. As I walked in behind Twilight a purple-lizard-thing strolled in from a corner. </p><p><i>'Huh.... So this is where Barney came from.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Being your subconscious I can take a lot of disturbing shit, but I swear if he suddenly breaks into a song....'</span></p><p>&quot;GAH! Twilight look out there's a monster behind you!&quot; </p><p>*giggle* &quot;Don't worry Spike he's harmless,&quot; Twilight turned and gave me an eye, &quot;most of the time.&quot; I just smiled. &quot;Anyways, Rodney this is Spike my number one assistant, Spike this is Rodney the human.&quot; just as Spike heard that last bit of information his eyes widened in recognition. </p><p>&quot;Wait, he's the guy you've been writing about in your letter? The one that was sucking up all that magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The one and only.&quot; I replied. &quot;And what exactly are you supposed to be? A mutated iguana?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm a dragon.&quot; it took me a while for his words to sink in.</p><p>&quot;.......What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A dragon, you know. Fire breathing, eats gems and all that. Why you never heard of us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have actually, we've got legends about dragons from my world, and yea they do breath fire though I'm not sure about the gems part.&quot; Twilight's ears perked up when she heard this and was about to question me further, so I continued on talking as to not give her a chance, something I've starting to get used to. &quot;Thing is they describe dragons to be, well.....bigger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well that's because I'm just a <i>baby</i> dragon.&quot; from the tone of his voice I might have hurt a bit of his feelings with my comment. &quot;Eventually I'll grow up bigger than the library, I'll get my wings as well as my-&quot;</p><p><b>Knock Knock!</b></p><p>&quot;Oh that must be the girls. Spike could you-&quot;.  </p><p><b>BAAAAMM!!</b></p><p>The door burst open nearly flying off its hinges by a bright pink pony, I was too confused and surprised to dodge the pink missile as it barreled down to my midriff. </p><p>&quot;Hi my name's Pinkie Pie and I'm so happy to finally meet you again I was suppose to see you tomorrow but <i>somepony</i> change their mind and I had a whole bunch of party pastries ready for your 'Welcome-to-Ponyville-and-thanks-for-not-destroying-Equestria' party but don't worry there was somepony who was more than happy to eat them all so no problemo but that mean's I have to make a new batch for the party *GAAASSSSP* that means I can plan an entirely new party for you and-&quot; between the confusion and being thrown on my ass I could only gather bits and peaces of what the pink pony was blabbering about, the fact that she's talking at break neck speed didn't help. What stood out the most was her mane and tail, they were a deeper shade of pink but was a jumbled mess of puff. </p><p>&quot;Pinkie Pie please get off him, I don't think he's even listening to you.&quot; from the tone of Twilight's voice it seems this was an everyday thing for her. &quot;And could you please prepare something for the girls? Thank you.&quot; I hear the clip-clop of numerous hooves, I looked up from the floor to see an orange earth pony with a mane and tail of bright blonde and what looked like freckles right under her eyes. Most notable was the cowboy hat she was wearing which managed to stay still as she galloped inside followed by three others. </p><p>&quot;Sorry 'bout that Twi. Ah tried tah stop her but once she read your message-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Its ok AJ, I should have expected Pinkie Pie reacting like she did.&quot;</p><p>*pant-pant* &quot;Applejack must we *pant* gallop all the way. I do not wish to smell of sweat just before meeting.......somepony.&quot; eventually her eyes drifted to the floor where I was still laying on my back rubbing the back of my head. She was a unicorn with a coat of ivory white which made her mane and tail of deep purple stood out more, they were curled and looked like it was made out of silk, probably feels like it too. I was just about to get back up but before I even got to my knees I was pushed back by a cyan blue pegasus with one hell of a dye job. </p><p>&quot;What are you doing in Ponyville huh? Are you a spy?&quot; she kept both her front hooves on my chest pinning me to the floor. I'm not the type to judge based on appearances or first impressions, but I could tell that this mare was not the brightest of the bunch. Actually she wasn't that bright period. </p><p>&quot;Are <i>you?</i>&quot; I replied with just as much accusation in my voice. </p><p>&quot;Course not! I'm the element of loyalty, I'll never betray my friends.&quot; she raised one of her front hooves off me to tap her chest, clearly she takes pride in that last bit. </p><p>&quot;Are you?&quot; she looked at me like I'm stupid or something for asking again. &quot;You <i>think</i> your their friend, you <i>think</i> your the element of loyalty. But what if your a sleeper hmm? A spy who doesn't know she's a spy.&quot; I wasn't sure if these ponies know what sleepers are, but by the way her pupils shrunk and how she started to murmur and sputter incoherent sentences, I think she does at least. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I gotta hand it to you, breaking someone right after meeting them. Kudos man.'</span></p><p>I took my chance and dragged my self away from the rainbow mare and finally got back on my feet. Soon as I did though I heard a small &quot;eep&quot; from a yellow pegasus who was trying her best to hide behind the white unicorn, but was failing horribly. She had a sakura colored mane and tail which looked much longer than the rest and despite any hairstyle it looked beautiful. But it was a different kind of beauty, it wasn't the kind that shows after using accessories or wearing fancy dresses, her's was a natural kind. She looked out from behind the unicorn but once our eyes met she let out another adorable squeal and disappeared behind her mane.</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Alright everypony calm down, everything's fine. He's not going to hurt anypony.&quot; Twilight bade each of her friends to gather before she starts, although she had to smack the rainbow pegasus with a book to snap her back to reality. &quot;Rainbow your <i>not</i> a spy! Now please just sit down with everypony.&quot; I was still standing in the same spot keeping my eye on the yellow pegasus as she continue to stand behind the white unicorn as they both made their way. When they were all finally sitting or laying down in a small semi circle around Twilight and myself she began to make the introductions.</p><p>&quot;Ahem, everypony this is Rodney,&quot; she raised a hoof to point at me, &quot;Rodney these are my friends; Applejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy.&quot; she pointed to each pony as she called their names. &quot;Now, I know I've given very little detail in the letter so I'll explain further. First of as you and the rest of the town already know he's not here to hurt or steal away anypony's magic, that was all a big misunderstanding and he wasn't doing it intentionally.&quot; Twilight went on to explain a brief review of my time in Canterlot, my unique ability and training under Twilight's supervision. Eventually she got to the point where both princesses agreed to let me live in Ponyville in order to learn more about this world and pony lives so that I can make something of myself as a teacher. However I wasn't paying any attention though it all, my mind was busy with something more problematic. &quot;And that's pretty much the gist of it, anypony got a question?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh mememememememememe!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don't have to yell Pinkie I can hear you just fine, what is it?&quot;	</p><p>&quot;Why is his eye twitching like that? Is that normal? Looks fun!&quot; Twilight turned and looked at me for the first time since she began talking to the group, sure enough my right eye was twitching erratically. </p><p>&quot;Uh Rodney? Everything ok?&quot; there was genuine concern in her voice as well as a bit of fear. Probably though I was about to explode or something.</p><p>&quot;........&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please.....end me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes ago.....]</p></div><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I DON'T CARE!!

TWILIGHT!&quot;</b> it came from the kitchen.</p><p><i>'THANK YOU!'</i> all the ponies and myself made a mad dash to the kitchen entrance, seeing as I was the only one standing I made it first. I ran into the kitchen only to have black smoke cover my vision and sting my eyes and I began coughing as I accidently breathed in some of the smoke, once I cleared out my lungs and waved the smoke away I see Spike huddle in a corner and covering his snout. He was trapped behind a blazing fire. </p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: First of, I'M BACK! Sorry for the long wait, trip had to be extended due to unforeseen events, and thanks to Pinkie Pie that includes a trip to the doctor to see if I got diabetes. If you all followed me I just posted a blog some time ago, right as I got home I immediately started writing cause I know you guys have been waiting too long for the next chapter. Now I already did some proof reading but that was also in haste so I might miss something here and there, yea I know two bad grammar chapters in a row but I really didn't want to make you guys wait any longer than you have to. </p><p>Second, I know Spike can't get hurt by the fire, I mean he jumped into lava once, or belly flopped. It's all in my grand, retarded design. </p><p>So please post up any mistakes and such in the comments and don't forget to give me thumbs up or down, I really want to know how this story stands. Hope you can see pass the crappy quality and enjoy the chapter. </p><p>God its good to finally be back home, and with Pinkie gone I get to play my 360 aga-WHAT THE HELL!</p><p>Why is my 360 PINK!!</p>

<p>﻿<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 13 - A purple unicorn and a naked human</p><p>Update: I did some alteration to the chapter so if there’s any inconsistency or problems that you notice please, PLEASE inform me. Thank you.</p><hr/><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Murphy's law, fucking you up no matter which world your in.'</span></p><p>I look around the kitchen trying to analyze the situation and find a solution, who knows maybe these ponies have a fire extinguisher or something. Looking at the intensity of the fire I figured it started from what looked like an old wood-base stove, <i>'which is built into the tree. *mental-facepalm*'</i> by this time the rest of the group had caught up with me each giving out a sudden gasp when they saw the blazing kitchen. Judging by how fast it's spreading it'll reach the main hall with and all the books in a matter of minutes, if that happen the entire building will probably be nothing more than coal and char in an hour or two. </p><p><i>'Priority: 1) Purple-lizard-thing-that-thinks-he's-a-dragon's safety. 2) Containing the fire, if that fails bail out and try to save as many books and stuff as possible.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Agreed, levitation spell?'</span></p><p><i>'Never tried it on something living, but it should work. Just snag him outta there.'</i> using my right arm I reached out into the air and focused on the purple dragon through the smoke and heat. So far I've only been able to control my spells strictly by visual or visible effects, unlike a physical body my magic have no sense to relay information such as contact, pressure, temperature, etc. Which is why it was difficult to tell if my spell was working properly since my magic blends perfectly with the fire, I could 'feel' my magic reserve draining but I wasn't sure if the spell was affecting the right target. Thankfully the little guy gave a sudden shout of surprise which hopefully meant that he was being lifted up. I jerked my hand back in a pulling motion and sure enough the smoke suddenly split apart as Spike flew past the fire, unfortunately by the time I realize that I didn't give much thought to which direction I was pulling, it was too late. </p><p>&quot;OOMPH!&quot; the impact blew the air out of my lungs and left me somewhat disoriented but fortunately I was able to catch him in my arms and keep my balance. </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh Spike! Are you ok!?&quot; Twilight stood on her hind hooves while her front rested on my thigh, trying to get a closer look. </p><p>*cough* &quot;<i>I'm</i> fine, dragon remember?&quot; *cough* &quot;But Owlowiscious....&quot; I looked down and saw that Spike was carefully holding unto an owl the same way I was holding unto him. From what I can tell it had numerous singed feathers which weren't all that bad, the worse was one wing which was char black. </p><p>&quot;Oh no, Fluttershy!&quot; the yellow pegasus galloped towards me and took the same standing position as Twilight next to me. </p><p>&quot;It doesn't look like there's any permanent damage but the smoke is causing most damage. We have to get him outside immediately.&quot; I lowered Spike down so that he could ride on top of Fluttershy who started galloping out the front door. </p><p>&quot;Everybody out! Twilight and I will try to get the fire under control!&quot; they didn't budge. <b>&quot;MOVE!&quot;</b> with a flinch they turned around and started galloping out of the library following Fluttershy. </p><p><i>'Right, options?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Water?'</span></p><p><i>Closest thing is the sink in the kitchen, won't get enough in time to douse the whole thing.</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'We could always try stomping on it.'</span></p><p><i>'Dammit now's not the time for-wait. That's it!'</i></p><p>&quot;Twilight! Can you make a shield spell that wraps around the entire kitchen? One that works like Celestia's bubble?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The one after you used that shampoo? Yes but why-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't have time to explain, just make one that wraps around the kitchen wall but keep the entry way open.&quot; </p><p>&quot;What are you-&quot;</p><p><b>&quot;TWILIGHT! NOW!&quot;</b> she jumped back in fright but eventually her horn glowed and her signiture purple aura started to form around the walls in the entire kitchen room except for the entry way. &quot;Now Twilight, on my signal I want you to close the entry way and seal the room completely, understand?&quot; she nodded. </p><p><i>'How much magic we got?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Not a lot from the looks of it, Luna's kick really drained our reserve. But it should be enough.'</span></p><p><i>'I'm using it all just to be safe.'</i> I channeled all the remaining magic in my into my stretched out palm where my raw magic started to form slowly into the size of softball. </p><p>&quot;Ready Twilight?&quot; she nodded with a look of realization on her face, her horn glowed brighter and so did the purple aura around the kitchen. I threw the fireball into the entry, &quot;Now!&quot; Just as it passed through the entry way the purple aura closed in and separated the kitchen from the outside world, trapping the air inside.</p><p><b>BOOOM! WRUUUUUSH!</b></p><p>Following the explosion was a surge of rushing flames and for an instant the entire kitchen engulfed by an azure inferno, the purple layer in the entry way bulged out threatening to break. But it held on and just as fast as it grew it shrunk back to it's original size once the inferno inside died out, the explosion instantly consumed all the oxygen in the room. In other words I used fire to fight fire. From what I could see pass the purple bubble there were no open flames, all that was left were a few glowing embers here and there. Unfortunately the kitchen was now completely black with char, ash and soot. It would take considerable renovations to get it back up and running, but it was a small price to pay to save the entire structure and it's contents. </p><p>&quot;My kitchen!&quot; Twilight screamed.</p><p>*exhale* &quot;It's called Murphy's law Twily, anything that can go wrong <i>will</i> go wrong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This isn't suppose to happen! It can't happen! I personally weaved the fire-proof spell, it was perfect.&quot; both of us walked into the kitchen to inspect the damage. Other than what looked like a fridge everything else was burnt, even the pots and pans were deformed by the heat. </p><p>&quot;Maybe it expired or something, when did you cast it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a chance, I design it to recharge itself a bit every time I walk past the front door. There's no reason for it to just suddenly.......*smack*&quot; Twilight facehoofed. </p><p>&quot;Figure out what happen?&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>YOU</i> happen Rodney!&quot; my eyes shot wide and I looked at her with a mix of surprise, confusion and even anger at her sudden accusation. &quot;You drained the spell out of my house! The moment you stepped inside every enchantment and ward I put up around the house is gone! In other words it's all your fault!&quot;</p><p>&quot;My fault!? Your supposed to be the braniac around her, aren't you supposedly Celestia's prized pupil? You should've thought ahead!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm...excuse me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You should be the one who's more aware, its your freaky powers after all!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm....Twilight I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know jack shit about my powers! You told me physical contact affect non-living objects, this tree looks pretty alive to me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please, we-&quot;</p><p>&quot;That’s why we need to do more research and training! If you had just-&quot;</p><p>&quot;TWILIGHT!&quot; both of us turned back to the entryway to see Fluttershy which suddenly shrunk into a nervous fit upon our gaze. &quot;Oh, uhm...so sorry to bother but, uhm... I really need to get Owlowiscious back to my cottage. If you don't mind that is.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh! Owlowiscious!&quot; with that Twilight galloped out the kitchen and out the front door, as she passed Fluttershy she lifted her up with her spell and dragged her along which made her squeal, which sent me into another twitching convulsion. </p><p>So there I was standing in the char remains of the kitchen alone with a twitching right eye and having absolutely no idea what to do next. <i>'I could just walk around town.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And possibly cause a town riot, we still don't know much about this town. And considering our initial arrival and nearly burning down the town's library, I doubt they'll want to do anything with us. Thanks to the smoke there's probably already a crowd outside, if they find out we're the ones that-'</span></p><p><i>'Got it, stay inside, stay out of sight.'</i> still I didn't like the thought of laying about for Twilight's return. Seeing as this was a library I thought to just grab a book and start reading. When I walked out the kitchen though the white unicorn, Rarity I think, was standing in the middle of the room glaring at me.</p><p>&quot;And where do you think you are going, hmmm?&quot; her voice was light and she spoke like someone straight out of an old romance chick flick, don't ask. </p><p>&quot;Well this is a library so I thought-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not tell me you are going to ignore that mess! Twilight told me to just keep an eye on you, and from what I over heard you were behind everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But that's-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No buts!&quot; her horn started to glow chalky white and out of a closet in the corner floated several janitorial equipment which see dump in front of me.</p><p>&quot;Oh hohoho, <i>heeellls</i> no!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh, so uncouth. And yes you are! Were you not responsible for this disaster?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only because Twi-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who caused that blue explosion earlier?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I did but that's becau-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you're still going to stand there and deny you played no part in destroying Twilight's kitchen?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now see if you put it like that...&quot; she just continue to glare at me. &quot;But I didn't...&quot; still glaring. &quot;If Twilight had only-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now you have the gall to accuse Twilight of burning her own home!?&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Dude even I can't see a way out of this, she's got that whole mother tone down.'</span></p><p>*sigh* &quot;Fine.&quot; she gave a satisfied smile as I grabbed some of the stuff which includes a mop and a broom, again the familiarity of this world unnerves me. But not as much as the daunting task in front of me, how I'm going to get rid of all the ash and burnt furniture is beyond me. </p><p><i>'Probably shouldn't have used up all my magic, would've made this a lot more manageable.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well there's a unicorn right in the room, why not leech a bit. I doubt she'll notice anything, plus we can test if these ponies can notice it.'</span></p><p><i>'Oh no, I've done enough damage turning Twilight's kitchen to cinders, I'm not gonna start leeching from her friends. Besides I still haven't had that talk with her yet.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I still think that's a stupid idea.'</span></p><p><i>'Noted.'</i> so I began to labor about while Rarity kept watch. I started moving some of the remaining intact furniture to a corner, would probably be best to move them out but I didn't want to spread the ash or go out in public yet. By the time Twilight came back with Spike who was carrying a sleeping owl with a heavily bandaged wing. </p><p>&quot;Thanks for watching overWAAAH! Rodney?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's me Twily.&quot; earlier on when I tried to move what remain of the table it crash and kicked up a lot of ash and soot, now I look just as menacing as I did with my original clothes, probably more with the destruction around me. &quot;I decided to-&quot;</p><p>*cough*</p><p>*sigh* &quot;<i>Rarity</i> decided it would be best that I try to clean up after the mess that the fire-&quot;</p><p>*cough-cough*</p><p>&quot;That <i>I</i> caused. Happy?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Quite.&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Wow, not one day and he already has you on a leash. Better not tell princesses, they would probably recruit her.'</span></p><p>&quot;Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.&quot; she trotted next to Rarity. &quot;I'm sorry you have to stay here all day Rarity, I'm sure you were busy with all your projects.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Think nothing of it dear, it's the least I could do considering the situation. But how is Owlowiscious? Will he ever...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Rarity, Fluttershy said that he the fire mostly burnt his feather which will grow back, his wing only suffered minor burns. The worst was that Fluttershy needed to pluck out all the damaged feathers to help start new feathers grow but with the burn it would hurt too much, that's why I had to put him to sleep with a spell. The rest of the girls went back home after, I guess they were exhausted with worry over him.&quot; Twilight went back to Spike and gently nuzzled the sleeping bird who reacted with a small 'who'.</p><p>&quot;Oh the poor thing, I’ll think of something to cheer him up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you Rarity but you don't have to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah tut tut tut, I will hear nothing of it, it's the least I could do. The poor thing will feel absolutely dreadful being grounded for who knows how long. Maybe something for you as well.&quot; it took a moment for me to realize her last comment was directed at me. </p><p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmmm, yes your attire simply won't do. It was at most average and clearly made by somepony who never created something for non-ponies.&quot; before I could get any say however she started to trot towards the door. &quot;Now for Owlowiscious it will have to be different, nothing too fancy and not hurt his injuries. For...I'm sorry dear but what was your name again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney, and you don't-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Interesting name, for you I'll make something similar but it should definitely have some more flare. I like the hood though, oh I could design some new ensembles with those. I could start using gems and...&quot;she started rambling on as she moved beyond the front door until her voice died off. </p><p><i>'I just can't deal with that one.'</i></p><p>&quot;Spike could you get Owlowiscious up stairs, let her rest in your crib for tonight.&quot; Spike nodded and went up to the second floor by some nearby stairs. &quot;Now then.&quot; she turned and looked at me. &quot;You will be sleeping down in the basement, I've setup a small bed there for you.&quot; she suddenly pointed a hoof at me and glared. &quot;Do NOT touch any of my equipment!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look I'm sorry ok? You were right, I should have been more careful, who knows what would happen the next time I accidently erase a safety spell. This time we got lucky, really lucky.&quot; her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>&quot;Wow, I guess you can be mature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't get use to it.&quot; I replied flatly. &quot;How did the fire start anyways? I thought my touch was suppose to only affect non-living objects.&quot;</p><p>Twilight let out a sigh, &quot;In all honestly half the things I know about your powers are based on observations and assumptions. It’s not like I never make mistakes before, just a lot less than anypony else when it comes to magic.&quot;</p><p>“Very modest of you,” I replied sarcastically causing her to laugh lightheartedly.</p><p>“I suppose your touch only affect non-sentient beings then instead of on-living but that’s still a guess. If the everything else still holds true you should only drained the enchantments on the tree itself so some spells around the house should still work. But my main point is your power is unique and unless we both put more effort into research and training something like this can easily happen again.”</p><p>&quot;Alright you made you point, we’ll dive back into that once thing settle down a bit ok? So how did....Owlowiscious was it? How did he get burned like that? Being an owl he could just fly away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;From what Spike said he was sleeping near the fridge to keep cool, the freeze spell gives off a cool air around and it was quite hot today. By the time any of them realize the fire was already spreading, before he was able to take off the fire licked one of his tail feathers and, well if Spike wasn't there it could have gone a lot worse.&quot; I could she her hold back some tears as she imagined other outcomes. &quot;Thank you for pulling him out of the fire, I was surprise how fast you acted and took control of the situation. It was actually kinda cool.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Think nothing of it, truth be told I was trying to save Spike. I wasn't really convince if he was really a dragon at the time.&quot; I rubbed my hand over her head. It wasn't like I was petting her like an animal, but being a pony and all it was hard not to. And by the look on Twilight's face I think she's actually enjoying it, maybe a bit too much.</p><p>&quot;Mmmmmm that feels nice.&quot; I stopped. &quot;Aww don't stop.&quot; she pleaded at me with puppy dog eyes and considering how big her eyes are, it was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>&quot;Sorry Twily but unless you want to end up like me,&quot; I spread my arms wide to show my ash covered body. &quot;I should probably take a bath.&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;It's upstairs but it's a shower though. I don't have enough space for a bathtub.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I prefer them actually, simpler and more efficient.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me show you where it is plus I need to check up on Owlowiscious.&quot; with that I grabbed a fresh set of clothes and followed Twilight upstairs. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Upstairs....]</p></div><p>&quot;Spike, how is Owlowiscious doing?&quot; as Twilight and Rodney took the last step upstairs they saw Spike standing over his crib which Owlowiscious was sleeping in.</p><p>&quot;He's still asleep, I'm worried how he'll react when he wakes up.&quot; Twilight went over to the purple dragon and gave him a comforting hug. As she him she looked at the human and pointed to a door which lead to the bathroom, seeing as they needed some time together Rodney left them alone and went inside.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Spike, I'm sure Owlowiscious will be fine. You heard what Fluttershy said, he'll grow his feathers back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know what happen, all I did was start the fire in the stove and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok Spike, I'm not angry and we stopped it before things got worse. I'm very proud of you for saving Owlowiscious.&quot;  they parted and stood over the crib.</p><p>&quot;I didn't do much, if you hadn't pull me out I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Spike I didn't pull you out,&quot; Spike looked at Twilight with a confused expression. &quot;Rodney was the one that saved the both of you. Didn't you see the blue fire?&quot; Spike looked down and scratched his chin with a claw.</p><p>&quot;I think so, that time I thought the fire finally caught on me. Is that his magic?&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;Dude that's....actually kinda cool. What else can the monkey do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's <i>Rodney</i> Spike, don't be rude now. And yea his magic is, different. He can actually.....oh no.&quot; Twilight's eyes widened and her ears dropped flat with dread, Spike took notice of this. </p><p>&quot;Twilight? What's-&quot; but before Spike could finish Twilight lifted both Spike and the crib with the owl and sent them hovering above the main room, she then made a sudden dash towards the door the human had just went through. She had forgotten that the shower was not <i>all</i> installed into the building, having water in constant contact with the living tree other than the roots will only harm and damage it. Thus the shower had a faucet that sprayed water with gravity which flowed through a hose sticking through a small wooden covering. That covering hid a great amount of water which was floating and wrapped in magic keeping it from touching and damaging the tree. That magic was controlled by a spell which uses the dials on the shower to control the flow and temperature of the water, if the human came into contact with any of those dials he’ll siphon and terminate the spell.</p><p>&quot;Rodney wait! Don't touch the-&quot;</p><p><b>BANG!</b></p><p>Luckily Twilight wasn't close enough for the door to make contact with her as it suddenly swung open and crashed into the wall, the large torrent of water that came gushing out was a different matter. It flooded the second level and flowed down to the first like a waterfall soaking up the books below and eventually flowed out the front door, carrying some books with it.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>As well as a purple unicorn and a naked human.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: Finally testing out my ability to describe and tell an intense moment, well maybe not that intense but it helps me test out how well I write out these types of situations. So please comment and criticize me, I'd like to know how to better bring out the story as much as I can. I wanna make my epic scenes in the future as best as possible. </p><br/><p>As you know I want to hear your opinions on the chapter as w hole as well, and please point out any grammar mistakes or confusion in the story. </p><br/><p>Now then, *shake-shake-shake* let's see if I can spray my 360 back to black.</p><br/><p>Pinkie: HI! How ya doing!?</p><br/><p>WAH! *SPRAAAAAAAAAAY*</p><br/><p>.........Now Pinkie, let's talk about this.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 14 - Look at the size of that thing<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>&quot;AAACHUUUU!! Ugh. *sniff-sniff* &quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh dear, uhm, here drink this. That is if you want to, perfectly fine if you don't, uhm, but please do.&quot; Fluttershy poured me another cup of hot tea from a pitcher that she held in her mouth, it was actually quite impressive, but let's rewind a bit.</p><p>Getting drenched right after sunset and having to spend nearly all night cleaning and salvaging whatever's left of the library, as well as my dignity, was torture. All I remember was undressing, getting in the shower which was far too small for my size, and somehow ending up butt naked outside the library. I can only imagine what the townsfolk think of me now, first I nearly burned the library next I'm streaking down the road riding a wave alongside Twilight. Add a cold night with no enchanted heating system, a damp bed, and little sleep it came to no surprise that I'd wind up with a cold in the morning. NOT what I what I expected my first night to be. Since Twilight had an entire library/home to fix she decided to leave me and Owlowiscious at Fluttershy's for the day. I know it's only a cold but sending me to someone who's practically a vet made me worry, though seeing as doctors here treat ponies it really didn't make much difference.</p><p>&quot;Please Fluttershy, you don't have to stay on my behalf. It’s already late afternoon and I'm sure there are animals that need your attention, I’m perfectly fine taking care of myself. I’ll just go back to the library and-” but before I could even get one leg off the small bed, Fluttershy suddenly flew up on top of the bed and and stared down at me, all traces of her anxiety and nervousness gone.</p><p>“Now listen here mister! A cold is nothing to be taken lightly! Twilight has asked me to take care of you and you will stay in bed. Is that understood!?”</p><p>*whimper*</p><p>“Good. Now uhm, if you could please finish drinking as much tea. That is, if you want to but it’s for the best that you do.” And just like that she’s back again. Ever since I arrived at her cottage after being dropped of by Twilight, the yellow pegasus has been acting erratically. Most of the time she remains her timid self, but whenever I try to leave or refuse any of her care she’d go ballistic. And if that weren’t enough to keep me on edge, I still have to deal with <i>him</i>.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Dammit she's right there! Grab her!’</span></p><p><i>‘I am not glomping anyone!’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Have it your way. Iiiiiiiiiiiiit's-'</span></p><p><i>'Don't you fucking dare.'</i></p><p>&quot;Oh uhm, so sorry for jumping on you like that. I'll just uhm be downstairs if you....oh dear.&quot; Fluttershy immediately went into a frantic rush, hovering left and right trying to see what went wrong with my right eye. &quot;Oh my goodness! Nononononono! What did I do? Was it the tea? Are you in pain? Oh please don't die! I'll grab the medicine.&quot; She ran downstairs and I could hear some clamor below as she rummaged through cabinets and drawers looking for something.</p><p>Several minutes later she came back carrying a saddle bag containing a large assortment of potions, salves, bandages and several other items I'm not familiar with. Just as I was about to question her intentions she rummaged into one bag and came out holding a syringe in her mouth. Whatever it was for it clearly was not meant for a human, that thing was gigantic, at least three times larger than a normal and had a needle twice as long and thick. Using her wing she took the instrument and poked it into a vial and began filling it with a large amount of orange liquid.</p><p>&quot;Now hold still please.&quot;</p><p><i>'Ah'</i> <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'crap.'</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later, at Golden Oaks Library....]</p></div><p>&quot;...EGD11050389, there that's the last one Twilight.&quot; Spike slid down from the ladder and immediately fell to the floor in exhaustion. &quot;And three shelves to go.&quot; nearby lay a towering pile of dried books that still needed shelving.</p><p>&quot;Did you check their contents?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Twilight, everything is still legible. Still smells funny though.&quot; With some effort Spike got up and made his way to Twilight. &quot;Can we do do the rest tomorrow? I'm beat plus we still haven't restocked the kitchen.&quot; Right on cue Twilight's stomach made a loud complaint.</p><p>&quot;Wow time does fly by when you're having fun.&quot; Spike just rolled his eyes, not in the least surprised. &quot;Do we still have enough left for dinner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm I think so. All the stuff in the fridge was saved and we've got plenty of leftovers from Pinkie's last party. Too bad all my gems are ruined.&quot; Spike grumbled.</p><p>&quot;How are the gems ruined, they looked perfectly fine to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They <i>look</i> fine but they taste awful, most of them tasted like burnt sugar. Eekkhh.&quot; Spike stuck his tongue out in disgust. &quot;I'll just give them to Rarity the next time she comes by.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure Rarity will be delighted, now go prepare for dinner. I'm going to go to Fluttershy's place and check on Rodney.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still say it's a bad idea to let him sleep here, especially downstairs with all that equipment. I mean look at what he did in one day! That monkey's a walking disaster.&quot; Spike started walking towards the kitchen which had been cleaned of all soot and ash but was practically barren except for the few items and furniture that the fire didn't touch.</p><p>&quot;I know he can be, <i>problematic</i>...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's an understatement!&quot; Spike yelled.</p><p>&quot;But I can't let him out of my sight. Princess Celestia's orders.&quot; A second later Spike's head poked out of the corner and he looked at Twilight with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>&quot;Why? You said he was harmless.&quot; Twilight mentally slapped herself for her carelessness.</p><p>&quot;He is Spike. The Princess is just....interested. He is, after all, the only one of his kind in Equestria.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...guess that makes sense.&quot; Spike's head disappeared back to the kitchen. &quot;But he better make up for my gems!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll be sure to tell Rarity to take him during her next gem hunt. *giggle* I'm sure he'll enjoy it.&quot; With that Twilight went out the front door. What came next was a blur of motion, Rodney came barreling in carrying a surprised and confused Twilight, dropped her on the floor and immediately slammed the door shut and leaned on it with his arms wide open bracing for impact. &quot;Rodney!? What the hay are you doing back here? You're supposed to be resting at Fluttershy's-&quot;</p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p>Before Twilight finished the sharp crack of splinters resounded through the air as something long, sharp, and metallic punctured through the wooden door, protruding mere inches away from Rodney's head causing small fragments to break off. Rodney's knees gave out at the sight of the needle poking through the wood where drops of orange liquid started to leak out from the tip. Silence fell with Twilight trying to fathom the situation while Rodney slumped to a sitting position by the door looking completely exhausted, weak and out of breath. The silence was broken with the tiniest tap from the door followed by a small soft voice.</p><p>&quot;Uhm, excuse me Twilight but, if you could be so kind to please open the door. I really have to administer some medicine to your friend.&quot; Twilight saw Rodney shaking his head frantically about, pleading with fearful eyes.</p><p>*siiiiiiiiiigh* &quot;Rodney open the door.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you crazy!? Look at the size of that thing! It went through your door for crying out loud!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney.&quot; Twilight spoke flatly, though her expression clearly showed that she was in no mood for back talk. With some hesitation Rodney got to his feet and after taking some slow steps from the door made a sudden dash and hid behind the large wood sculpture in the middle of the room. Purple aura covered the door as Twilight opened it with her magic, behind it stood the timid Fluttershy wearing a unusual type of strap around her body where several syringe each filled with orange liquid like the one still stuck sticking on the door were being held in small slots. To Rodney it looked similar to how snipers or soldiers would wear bullet straps with their equipment.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/2b6455f40ef3b45c552a9d65358195fcf956d5ac?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gtrmusic.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fproducts%2Fguitar-accessories%2Fguitar-straps%2FDSL-bullet-guitar-strap-bulg25-15-1al.jpg" /></p></div><p>&quot;What's going on Twilight? Who's in the front-GAH!&quot; as soon as Spike saw Fluttershy walking into the library with a multitude of giant syringe he jumped up in fright and fell to a crouching position, ready to leap away from any attempt of capture. &quot;Twilight I said I'm not getting a shot! And nothing you, the vet, or Fluttershy can do anything about it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aw aren't you just the cutest baby dragon. *giggle* Don't worry Spike these are for Rodney not you.&quot; Fluttershy spoke in a light caring and amused tone.</p><p>&quot;Aah pheeew, in that case-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your's is next week.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fluttershy, that was suppose to be a secret!&quot; Twilight yelled.</p><p>&quot;Oh right, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, I-it was a-ooh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok Fluttershy, I'm not angry. And you <i>are</i> going Spike, no buts!&quot; Spike kicked the floor and started to murmur something as he walked back into the kitchen. Seeing as he's got the mentality of a child, I'd wager he was already scheming a way out. &quot;Now will somepony just explain what the hay is going on!?&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later.....]</p></div><p>&quot;...so I thought he needed his medicine, but before I could he suddenly ran and jumped out the window. I thought the cold was making him delirious and I was afraid he might hurt himself so I chased him and, uhm well that's how we wound up here. Are you mad? Please don't be mad, he got away before I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not mad Fluttershy it's ok. *sigh* It's just that I probably should have expected something like this.&quot; Twilight gave me a flat look.</p><p>&quot;Why are you looking at me for!? She's the one trying to kill me!&quot; Fluttershy head dropped low as she hid behind her pink mane and started to sniffle.</p><p>&quot;Look at what you did! You hurt her feelings. She's only trying to help you.&quot; Twilight yelled at me while holding a hoof pointed at Fluttershy. &quot;Apologize!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok Twilight, he doesn't have to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes he does!&quot; Twilight glared up at me still pointing at Fluttershy.</p><p>&quot;But I-&quot; Twilight brought down her hoof with a stomp and glared at me even harder. It was hard seeing the pegasus in that state and although her treatments were somewhat....lethal, it was still out of kindness. I walked over to her and kneeled down which made her sink deeper behind her mane. &quot;I'm sorry I accused you of attempted murder, but c'mon if you look at it from my perspective it was-.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot;</p><p>*sigh* &quot;I'm sorry. For jumping out your window and making you chase me around. I'm just not good with needles is all, I guess I over reacted a bit.&quot; Slowly she moved out from her pink veil to look at me.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!'</span></p><p><i>'Ugh FINE!'</i></p><p>Slowly I reached out and pulled the pegasus into a light hug which made her squeal, making her all the more adorable. She was tense the for the first few seconds, but eventually she calmed down and even threw her front hooves behind my neck as she returned the hug. The word 'soft' does not do her justice, in fact I doubt there's anything I've ever touched in my life that comes close to her coat and her mane was even more so. It was smooth as silk and felt extremely light easily flowing through my fingers and arms, models would kill to get natural hair like this.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Do it!'</span></p><p>*sigh* I squeezed.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csO8_NCaYFI" rel="nofollow">*squee*</a></p><p>&quot;.......&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT-k8t3WrQ" rel="nofollow">*squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee-squee*</a></p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry 'bout that, kinda lost myself there.&quot; With some reluctance, I let the pegasus go and felt a sudden emptiness in my life.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'We're doing that again right?'</span></p><p><i>'..... yes.'</i></p><p>&quot;Now then, Fluttershy would you care to join us for dinner? I'm afraid we don't have much since the fire but you're still welcome to join.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh no Angel! Sorry Twilight but I have to go back and feed Angel. Uhm maybe next time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's fine, say hi to him for me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh I will, and uhm sorry about everything again.&quot; she turned and galloped out the door, only to double back to pry the syringe out of the door with her mouth and inserted it into an empty slot on her strap with a wing. &quot;Uhm, bye then.&quot; She flew off back towards her cottage.</p><p>&quot;Angel?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;Oh you didn't see him? Angel is Fluttershy's pet bunny.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The white one?&quot; she nodded. &quot;Huh, gonna have to make another apology. I hope she find him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; She asked threateningly.</p><p>&quot;Nothing. Let's eat shall we? All that running made me hungry.&quot; I walked into the kitchen before Twilight could start asking questions.</p><p>&quot;Wait a minute how's your cold? Are you sure you don’t want to go back with Fluttershy?&quot; Twilight asked once she entered the kitchen.</p><p>&quot;Still have it, but I definitely feel better. Fluttershy gave me some tea before the whole fiasco, so it was either that or all the running around.&quot; I grabbed a plate Spike offered.</p><p><i>*sigh* 'More vegetarian crap.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And not the high quality stuff from the castle either, looks like leftovers.'</span></p><p>&quot;Hey Twilight,&quot; I sat on the floor leaning to the wall. &quot;I there any chance for me to eat meat in Ponyville?&quot; I rummaged through the various plants and veggies on my plate, separating those I can eat and not.</p><p>&quot;Y-you eat meat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Funny hearing that from a dragon, who's eating a salad I might add.&quot; I teased. &quot;Yes I eat meat, but also plants and veggies as you can clearly see.&quot; I took a bite of lettuce. &quot;It's called being an omnivore. And no I don't eat ponies or dragons.&quot; Spike let out a sigh relief. &quot;Much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't listen to him Spike, he's just teasing you. And sorry but no, all the residents of Ponyville are all ponies.&quot; <i>'of course they are, what was I thinking.’</i> &quot;You should probably ask Fluttershy, it's rare but sometimes she also takes care of carnivorous animals though she mostly feeds them fish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right now I'll settle with pretty much anything.&quot; I gave Spike a look while licking my lips in anticipation which made him scoot closer to Twilight. &quot;So where am I going to be living then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Twilight asked between mouthfuls.</p><p>&quot;Don't tell me you still plan on letting me stay here?&quot; her lack of response was all the answer I need. &quot;Twilight this place needs magic in order for you to live in, unless you plan on living without any cooked food or baths.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not, it's just that....&quot; She started to mutter a bit trying to find an excuse or reason, clearly she still felt I wasn't ready or something.</p><p>&quot;Alright look I'll stay here for another night, but tomorrow we need to find me a place to live that won't cause any natural disasters whenever I fart. Agreed?&quot; Though there was some hesitation I knew Twilight couldn't refuse the logic in my reasoning and as predicted she agreed.</p><p>The rest of the day we spent eating and chatting with each other on the kitchen floor. At least Twilight and I was, Spike kept trying to talk his way out of his inevitable injection. After dinner Twilight and Spike went back to organizing the library and seeing as I was the cause, I helped. But it only lasted for roughly half an hour before nightfall came and so we decided to pick up where we left off tomorrow morning.</p><p>&quot;Hey Twilight!&quot; I yelled.</p><p>&quot;You don't have to shout I can hear you perfectly fine from up here.&quot; Her head poked out over the railing on the second floor.</p><p>&quot;You wouldn't happen to have a spare blank book do you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do actually, why do you need it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was thinking of writing a journal of sorts.&quot; One of the eyebrows rose.</p><p>&quot;Like a diary?&quot; I waved a hand as if slapping that idea away.</p><p>&quot;Nothing so personal, it's just to keep track of things. Like you said we need to make more effort in researching my powers right?&quot; Twilight beamed proudly at my initiative. </p><p>&quot;There should be two or three by the study, go ahead and grab the ink and quill as well.&quot; She pointed to a small desk to one side of the library. I said my thanks and sure enough found a thick virgin book which was tied with strings that gave it a nice old time look to it. I took one and held it within my armpits as I grabbed the ink and quill from the table and headed down to the basement.</p><hr/><p><i>First entry.</i></p><p><i>Ok so first day could*SPLOT*</i></p><p><i>First thing: learn how to write with a qui*SPLOT*</i></p><p><i>Second thing: get another book I get a feeling this one's gonna run out fast.</i></p><p><i>Right, so first day was absolute hell. Apparently items or even buildings can contain enchantments, so now I have to watch out for everything! Not only stuff that looks like it runs on magic. During the fire fiasco I discovered that not knowing how much magic reserve I have accurately can be problematic. Next time I might not be so lucky, could even be fatal. So first I need a clear, direct, and consistent measurement of my magic reserve. </i></p><p><i>Second I need a list of spells. So far, I've only developed a few of them, but I’m not sure how far my subconscious can go and I'm not willing to take the risk of forgetting a spell when I might need it in dire situations. So this should act as a backup.</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through">Current spells:</span></p><p><i>Current stable spells:</i></p><p><i>1) Levitation</i><br/><i>Type: Constant</i><br/><i>Takes hand gestures as input for control and requires visual of target. Past experiments without visuals result in me grabbing random shit.</i></p><p><i>2) Magnet</i><br/><i>Type: Passive or constant</i><br/><i>Surprisingly works for modified roller blades, though it’s only really effective on flat surfaces. Takes feet movement as input for control and with some alteration I can control the positive and negative attractions.</i></p><p><i>3) Fireball</i><br/><i>Type: Active</i><br/><i>Not sure if I should include this one or not considering it's just my raw magic. Explosion (radius) depends upon amount of magic, activates on contact of anything else other than my body. Thank god I*SPLOT*</i></p><p><i>4) Propulsion</i><br/><i>Type: Active</i><br/><i>Basically used to replicate the gunpowder system in guns. Level of speed and accuracy depends on magic input, the more magic the less accurate but more speed. (simplify to -&gt; more magic = lower accuracy + greater speed?) Suck it Blueblood.</i></p><p><i>5) Shield</i><br/><i>Type: Passive</i><br/><i>Best. Spell. Ever. Activates only if anything approaches it beyond a specific speed. Set to drain as much magic as needed to repel incoming object, double edged as it can easily drain me entirely. It also activates to any incoming projectile despite the size, thus a shield for my entire body will activate even though I get hit with a pebble sized object. Requires massive fine tuning to be effective.</i></p><p><i>I’ll add my abilities as well while I'm a*SPLOT*.</i></p><p><i>My unique abilities:</i></p><p><i>1) Touch</i><br/><i>Drains any </i><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through">non-living</span><i> non-sentient object, no matter the size, of its enchantments. Limited only that object, even if something else is directly in contact with said object it will be affected. In other words the effect doesn't spread by contact from one object to another. Except if their magically connected, Twilight mentioned something like that on her shower.</i></p><p><i>2) Instant siphon</i><br/><i>Can siphon particular amounts of magic from an individual or spell, however I require to first 'weigh' how much magic it has. For some reason I cannot simply assume to take half unless I know how much half of it is. Unless I decided to just take it all, however this leaves the source, if living, completely drained in a state similar to extreme exhaustion. Plus I might accidentally take in more than I can handle, I can't imagine the level of migraine if that happens.</i><br/><i>(Additional note: My current ‘range’ appears to be about five meters, anything beyond that I can’t drain. Probably because my ‘sense’ only extends that distance, anything I can’t ‘see’ or ‘feel’, I can’t drain.)</i></p><p><i>3) Constant siphon</i><br/><i>Hard to control, requires consistent focus to maintain. Too much work really, prefer instant method. Retains a constant flow of magic being siphon from a single target, in theory it should be possible to do more but I lack the skill and focus for now, if ever. Has more accurate control on the rate in which I drain the target. </i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through">End entry.</span></p><p><i>And remember to ask Twilight if she knows a spell to get rid of ink splotches. </i></p><p><i>End entry.</i><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: Sorry for the delay, I'm new to working with an editor and there were some things on the technical side we needed to get through. But don't worry the editing process is smoother now since we manage to get it working on Google doc. Again praises to Noxxels he's done a decent job despite being new. In other words we've got both a nooby writer and editor, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>You'll also notice something at the end there. I added it so that we can keep track of Rodney's spells and what not, that way readers aren't confused (I hope this doesn't confuse anyone further) and we can follow his progress and stuff.</p><p>As usual please comment and criticize, this time it's for both me and Noxxels so more the reason to do so.</p><p>Pinkie: Done?</p><p>Yup, masks?</p><p>Pinkie: Check.</p><p>Goggles?</p><p>Pinkie: Checkoroony.</p><p>Well then, *inhale*</p><p>Me &amp; Pinkie: SPRAY-PAINT WAR!!</p>

Thank you.</p><hr/><p>*poke*</p><p>&quot;.......&quot;</p><p>*poke-poke*</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>*poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke*</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Spike this has better be........dafuq?&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Library main room.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Good morning Rodney! You're up early.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight, *sniff* what is this?&quot; The chains made a few jingling noise as I raised my right arm, where what looked like a small bird with tiny wings and an enormous beak the size of its head was hopping about between my hand and elbow. What's interesting about the little creature was how little bits of flame would streak out whenever he moves or flapped his tiny wings. Those flames felt strangely familiar to how I 'feel' magic, they certainly gave off heat but never beyond a point where it hurts. Considering that this world has unicorns, pegasi and a purple dragon, it wouldn't be much of a surprise if the little guy turned out to be a...</p><p>&quot;Oh that's Peewee, Spike's pet baby phoenix.&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Called it.'</span> &quot;I was wondering where he went. The little guy likes to explore a lot so we tend to lose sight of him here and there, though he always manages to come back just fine. Was he down in the basement with you all this time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not sure, I thought Spike was trying to wake me up a few minutes ago but instead I found Peewee here pecking me head.&quot; I tapped the side of my head for indication. &quot;So...a phoenix.&quot; It let out several small chirps in response. &quot;Where did Spike find it, is there like a pet store that sells phoenixes in town?&quot; I started to pet the little guy with a finger. &quot;Cause I would freakin love-&quot;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">SNAP!</span></p><p>&quot;Oh right, Peewee likes to bite things. So don't-&quot;</p><p>&quot;AAAAARRGH!! Get it off me! Get it off me! Oh god it hurts!&quot; Twilight jumped up in fright before turning around to see me frantically waving my hand about. I was hoping the momentum would dislodge the bird from my finger but it only caused the chain fly around and smack me in the face. &quot;God dammit!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney hold still! You’re going to hurt Peewee if you keep waving your arms like-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight I swear I'll drain this guy empty if you don't do something!&quot; Even though it didn't draw any blood it had bit down on a particular area that had a large cluster of nerves.</p><p>&quot;No don't! We don't know how your powers will react to a magical creature like Peewee! You could harm it!&quot; She pleaded. </p><p>&quot;Arrgh! Then do something!&quot; I pointed my finger at her, shoving the little devil to her face. She suddenly bit down gently but firmly on its little tail feather and started to pull back. It took a while and the strain caused even more pain but eventually its beak slid off. After smacking into Twilight’s face, the fiery bird jumped up and started chirping atop Twilight’s head like it had all been a game or something. &quot;What is it with everyone's pet trying to eat me?&quot; I mumbled irritably. </p><p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; This time Twilight clearly overheard. </p><p>*sigh* &quot;Back at Fluttershy's cottage while I was on her bed upstairs she went down below preparing tea for me. That's when this white bunny, Angel I presume, jumped on the bed and started looking at me funny. I reached out to pet it, but the little bastard suddenly bit down on my finger much like how Peewee did. Luckily it didn't have much jaw strength so I manage to pry him off by waving my hand like I did earlier.&quot; I started sucking on my finger, hoping that will somehow ease the throbbing pain. </p><p>&quot;That didn't sound so bad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It wasn't really, at least for me it wasn't. Unfortunately for <i>Angel</i> he let go at the wrong moment. Bastard flew out the second story window.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey it wasn't my fault and it was an accident! Besides, when I looked out the window I saw him scurry off somewhere so he's fine.&quot; I argued.</p><p>*sigh* &quot;The next time we see Fluttershy you're going to tell her and apologize.&quot; Twilight lowered her head down to the floor where Peewee jumped off and started hopping to who knows where.</p><p>&quot;Yea alright.&quot; I said somewhat flatly which caused Twilight look at me with narrowed eyes. &quot;I will ok? Promise.&quot; She seemed convinced and went back to whatever she was doing before. It was then that I noticed how different the library looked. &quot;Oh wow you've been busy.&quot;	</p><p>From the looks of it, Twilight had gotten up early to finish organizing the library back to shape. All the books and tomes that were left on the floor last night had disappeared back into their proper place among the many shelves along the wall. She went even further and started to clean up after my disaster as well. Now the library was in the exact pristine condition it was when I first arrived, except for the kitchen which is still missing a great deal of furniture and utensils. </p><p>&quot;Well I just couldn't sleep properly knowing the library was in such a mess.&quot; Her horn was glowing as several dusters moved about the room finishing up the last few dirty corners in the room. &quot;Plus we have a lot to do today so we can't waste time cooped up in here. Still got that cold I see.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Don't worry about it, I feel much better. It'll probably be gone by tomorrow. Where's the little guy?&quot; Looking around there was no sign of the purple dragon anywhere.</p><p>&quot;Spike? He went to Fluttershy's cottage to check up and bring back Owlowiscious, I was suppose to bring him back along with you but after the what happen I completely forgot about him.&quot; Her head sunk slightly. &quot;How could I forget about him like that? *sigh* I'm a terrible owner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't say that Twilight, it was mostly my fault. Besides, I'm sure Fluttershy took good care of him and I doubt he feels lonely with all the animals she has.&quot; Twilight's demeanor brightened a bit as she started smiling again. &quot;How long has he been gone though?&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;He's going to be out for quite some time.&quot; </p><p>&quot;What's so funny?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The vet is also waiting there for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But didn’t you say it was going to be next....oooohh. Wow didn't think you had it in you Twily, making someone walk into his own death sentence like that. Cold.&quot; I teased.</p><p>&quot;Don't say it like that! Besides it's for his own good and Fluttershy is the only one who can help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But why Fluttershy? What's wrong with the vet?&quot; I could tell she was good with animals but convincing a kid like Spike to get an injection? I had my doubts.</p><p>*sigh* &quot;Despite his age he is still a dragon, sometimes he's even harder to catch than Opal, Rarity's pet cat. I don't know what I'll do once he gets his wings. So I have to rely on Fluttershy, she's the only who can keep Spike still long enough to get the treatment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's going to get real pissed once he get's back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's another thing,&quot; her voice suddenly taking serious tone. &quot;The Princesses and myself may tolerate that kind of language back in the castle. But you <i>will</i> watch your mouth in Ponyville, there are children here and I will not have my Spike talking like you. Understand?&quot; Her glare left no room for argument.</p><p>&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot; Satisfied she went back to cleaning out the library with her magic which reminded me of something I meant to do. &quot;Hey Twilight you got a minute to talk? I've been meaning to ask you something.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I'm telling you this is unnecessary.'</span></p><p>&quot;Sure, what is it?&quot; </p><p>&quot;I've been meaning to ask about this whole 'siphoning your magic thing' we have going on.&quot; Now that I was actually going through with it I felt uneasy and unsure. </p><p>&quot;What about it?&quot; Looks like she pick up the fact that I was struggling with this conversation and was now giving me her full attention. </p><p>&quot;Well I, uh... *sigh* It just feels like I'm taking advantage of you more, and the fact that you've been supervising me and even willing to take me in didn't help either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me get this straight, you're feeling guilty for taking my magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In a nutshell, yes.&quot; Out of nowhere Twilight started to giggle and laugh. &quot;Ooook.... Did not expect that.&quot;</p><p>*giggle* &quot;I'm sorry Rodney, I guess I'm just surprised. I just never expected something like this since your so....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Immature? Childish? Juvenile? Crude?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How’s about all of the above? *giggle* But seriously though it's fine Rodney. Princess Celestia and Luna sent you to Ponyville to learn not only about ponies but to also learn more about yourself. That includes your abilities and magic and if you need any just come to me, I'm more than happy to give you some. Besides I still don’t know the extent of your abilities, how can I conduct any research if you can’t use magic?&quot;</p><p>&quot;So no hard feelings? At all?&quot; she shook her head. &quot;But don't you also need magic to continue your studies?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't underestimate me Rodney, I may not be as powerful as the Princess but my special talent is magic after all. I have more than enough to give.&quot;</p><p><i>'Oh I know Twilight.'</i> During the earlier sessions with Twilight I started to realize how much larger her 'fire' was from every other ponies around. In fact, till now I've yet to see anyone that comes close to Twilight's level other than Celestia and Luna. </p><p>&quot;Truth be told Rodney I had expected to find ponies sleeping on the street by now.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ouch. Twilight that just hurts, I'm not that low.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry, honestly you’re really hard to predict at times you know that. So is that all then? No more deep thoughts you wish to share?&quot;</p><p>*chuckle* &quot;No Twilight that’s all, thank you. Maybe next time. So is it ok then if I....&quot; I smiled sheepishly at her and she just rolled her eyes and gave me a smile before her horn started to glow. The same purple sphere from our sessions appeared and floated towards me,  I reached out with my mind and drained the spell until I felt the familiar tingling headache start to form before I stopped. &quot;Thank you Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said, it's no problem at all. Now then, are you hungry?&quot; </p><p>*growl*</p><p>*giggle* &quot;I'll take that as a yes, unfortunately there's not much left after last night. We'll have to go to the market today if we want to eat anything, or maybe Sugarcube Corner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The pastry shop? Hell why not? Sugar for breakfast!&quot; I shouted childishly. Twilight just rolled her eyes a second time in response as she continue to dust off a few more corners before returning the feather dusters back behind a compartment. </p><p>&quot;Honestly, sometimes you're no different from a foal. Didn't you say you were considered an adult back in your world? Or is <i>this</i>&quot; she pointed a hoof at my head and traced it to my feet, &quot;what's considered adult behavior?&quot; I merely looked at her with a childish grin across my face.</p><p>&quot;A wise man once said: Growing old is inevitable, growing <i>up</i> is entirely optional.&quot; And before Twilight could start lecturing me about how stupid that sounds I ran up the stairs, into the bathroom, and shut the door. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Some time later, on the street towards Sugarcube Corner....]</p></div><p>It took some time getting used to but eventually I started to ignore all the stares, it was actually a bit amusing really. One stallion actually came up to me and asked where he could buy a pet monkey like me, only for Twilight to march up to him and start lecturing him like a child in front of a crowd. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well at least we know she actually cares.'</span>	</p><p>&quot;I'm so sorry about that! Please don't mind him he didn't know what he was saying, says he missed the town meeting about you.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It's alright Twily, it was actually kinda fun watching you talk him down like that.&quot; But seeing as she's still somewhat uncertain I started rubbing her head again which immediately brought a satisfied smile on her face. &quot;Does it really feel that good?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mmm it's like getting a message, your hands are really soft you know. Not like Spike's.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lady fingers eh? I guess I can take that as a compliment in this world.&quot; She looked at me through her ruffled mane waiting for me to elaborate. &quot;The stereotype for men in my world is that guys should be rough and tough, it's an old one but it's still there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don’t have to worry about that here. I’m sure Rarity will love it, she often goes to the spa for massages but I-hhmm I doubt the twins could match your fingers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright that's enough of that, otherwise they might start getting the wrong idea about us.&quot; Once Twilight snapped out of it she noticed how many of the ponies around was now staring at her, interestingly enough one mint green unicorn actually looked jealous of her. We eventually continued on our way with Twilight taking a quicker pace trying to escape the crowd's attention. Sometime later my eyes fell upon a building which appeared to have jumped straight out of 'Hansel and Gretel', it looked just like how I imagined the witch's house to be.</p><p>&quot;Twilight this might sound like a weird question, but the building isn't really made out of....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not silly, otherwise Pinkie would've eaten it already. It is understandable though, once in awhile somepony from out of town would actually try and take a bite.&quot; She raised a hoof and pointed a nearby corner of the building. Sure enough there were some faded bite marks on some chocolate fudge decoration. </p><p>&quot;Admit it Twily there were times when you wished it <i>was</i> edible right?&quot; I said playfully.</p><p>&quot;Ehehe, how'd you guess?&quot; Her cheeks started to glow a bit in embarrassment . </p><p>&quot;It's nothing to be embarrassed about, it's actually kinda cu-<b>GUH!</b>&quot; Out the front door flew a hyper pink pony which hit me in the stomach and sent me flying back a few feet, ass kissing dirt. </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh you’re here! You're here! You're here! Did you come here just to see me!? Huh? Did'ya did'ya did'ya?&quot; As if being barreled down wasn't enough, she was now using my gut as a trampoline. </p><p>&quot;Pinkie please I-ugh. I need you to-ugh. Pinkie you're hurting-ugh. Twilight don't just-ugh. Twilight!&quot; With suppressed giggles Twilight's horn glowed as she magically lifted the pink hazard away from me. </p><p>&quot;Oh heya Twilight! What are you doing here? Is the library fixed? Where's Spike?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We came to pick up breakfast, the library is fixed except we still need to resupply the kitchen, and Spike is with Fluttershy.&quot; It's obvious that Twilight's gotten used to Pinkie's behavior. </p><p>&quot;Oh well then come on in, I've just finished baking a fresh batch.&quot; Twilight walked through the front door with Pinkie floating behind still being suspended in a purple aura. </p><p>&quot;Uuuuurgh.....&quot; </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Can we please make an effort to stay away from that one?'</span></p><p><i>'Agreed.'</i></p><p>&quot;Yah a'right there partner?&quot; A pony wearing cowboy hat came into view as she trotted up before my head. &quot;We haven't been properly introduced yet have we? Name's Applejack, ah run Sweet Apple Acres with mah brother Big Macintosh.&quot; She raised a hoof over my head which I took, where she suddenly shook with a rough and wild shake. </p><p>&quot;Rodney.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's a pleasure meeting ya Rodney! Would yah like to try out one of our apples from the farm? Best apples in Equestria and freshly picked too.&quot; She waved a hoof in a large arc before me with pride.</p><p>&quot;Sure why not? But I don't have any money with me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Think of it as a sample, ah'm positive yer gonna want more in the future. Applebloom, an apple please.&quot; It was only when I got back on my feet did I notice how Applejack was strapped onto a stall with wheels loaded with baskets filled with the reddest apples I've ever seen. Just looking at them made my mouth water, even more so considering I haven't eaten anything today. </p><p>From the corner of my vision I noticed a large red ribbon poking behind the corner of the stall and right below it was the cutest pair of awestruck eyes I've ever seen, after Fluttershy of course. Her coat was yellow, similar to that of Fluttershy's and her mane and tail were light-rose red. She's the first filly I've seen so far, basically a shrunk down version of a normal pony. She was afraid and wary of me but being a child her curiosity got the better of her, slowly she started to emerge from behind the stall. When I finally got a clear view of her I realize that unlike other ponies she lacked a cutie-mark on her rear end. The fact that I was able to noticed it so quickly showed just how much I've gotten used to being around these ponies. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Please, you just like staring at their flanks.'</span></p><p>&quot;It's a'right Applebloom, don't be shy now.&quot; With some encouraging words from Applejack the little filly hopped onto to the stall and jumped back down with a bright red apple held in her mouth. As she made her way towards me I bent low to a crouch taking a less intimidating posture, with a gentle smile I held out my hand where she slowly approached and dropped the apple. The moment I grasped the apple, her demeanor changed instantly. All semblance of fear gone to the wind allowing her childish curiosity to overwhelm her behavior. She started to poke me in a few places with a hoof, sniffed at my clothes which made her cringe a bit and even tried to climb over my back before Applejack intervened. </p><p>&quot;Awww but Applejack.&quot; She pleaded. Her voice was light and she had the same southern slur as Applejack which made me suspect the two to be related.</p><p>&quot;You two related?&quot; I asked with a bit of a chuckle at their antics. </p><p>&quot;Yup! Ah'm Applebloom, but I guess yah already know that, Applejack's mah sis, Big Mac's mah brother and there's Granny Smith.&quot; She was still circling around me scrutinizing my figure and my clothes. &quot;Hey mister-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can call me Rodney.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Right uhm, Rowdney, why ar'ya wearing all them clothes? Ain'tcha hot in that getup? How come ah'v never seen anypony like you before? Where's yer cutie-mark?&quot; It took quite a bit of effort to resist the urge of picking her up like a puppy, from the way her bow bobbed around to her movement, to her innocent curiosity, it was probably enough adorableness to cure cancer. </p><p>&quot;I'm called a human, no we do not have cutie-marks and the reason for the clothes is because humans like me don't have coats like you do, so we need them to keep warm. And as for not seeing <i>someone</i> like me before it's simply because there's only one of me in all Equestria.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Soooo, yer like one of them endangerous species?&quot; She asked with one eyebrow raised.</p><p>&quot;<i>Endangered</i>, and yea I guess you could call it that.&quot; Applebloom placed a hoof on her chin as if trying to solve a riddle.</p><p>&quot;Then why aren'tya in a zoo?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Applebloom!&quot; I was barely able to suppress my laughter from Applejack, I didn't want her to know I wasn't the least bit insulted. &quot;Yah don't go around asking ponies why they ain't in a zoo!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But yer the one who said rare critters can only be seen in them zoos!&quot; My body started to jerk a bit from the urge to burst out laughing, unfortunately for Applejack she thought that meant I was angry or something. </p><p>&quot;Please don't mind the little one, she's still a youngin and don't know any better.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ah ain't little!&quot; Between Applejack's flustered face and Applebloom's adorable scowl at her sister, it was too much for me to handle. </p><p>&quot;Pfft HAhahaha! It's alright Applejack I understand, I'm not offended or anything. *chuckle* No Applebloom I don't belong in a zoo.&quot; Applejack let out a sigh of relief as the tension left her, only to be replaced by a look of irritation. </p><p>&quot;Well why didn'tcha say so in the first place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And where's the fun in that?&quot; I asked with a mischievous grin which made Applebloom giggle.</p><p>&quot;Why I ahtta-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Applejack? Applebloom? What are you two doing here? I was expecting to see you at the marketplace.&quot; Twilight came out of Sugarcube Corner levitating a small box in front of her. &quot;Rodney what did you do this time?&quot; She asked flatly.</p><p>&quot;I was just getting to know Applejack and little Applebloom, and I resent the fact that you immediately assume I am at fault in every situation.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ah ain't little!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's a'right Twilight he speaks the truth, we were just getting acquainted is all. Ah just happened teh be on mah way from the market and setup shop when ah saw him laying on the street and thought he might be hurt or somesuch.&quot; Applejack explained.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, it was just Pinkie being Pinkie.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thought so. Care to buy a few apples while ah'm here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Actually I was hoping to buy some, we were on our way to the market to resupply the kitchen. Wait, did you say you were came <i>from</i> the marketplace? Why did you leave so early? That's not like you AJ.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Didn'tcha hear sugarcube? There's a rain scheduled today, the markets pretty much deserted by now.&quot; I looked up and sure enough gray clouds were starting to gather above where pegasi were.....<i>'wait a minute.'</i></p><p>&quot;Was that today? Well in that case I'll gladly-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight.&quot; I interrupted. &quot;Why are those pegasi doing?&quot; Above our heads flew several pegasi here and there carrying bundles of gray could sand sticking them like clay. </p><p>&quot;What? The weather team? They're just getting ready for the rain today, don't tell me you forgot they could manipulate the weather. I know I mentioned it before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You did but I, it's just...*sigh* I guess it's something else to actually see it.&quot; Truth be told, when Twilight mentioned 'manipulate', I assumed it was simply to alter or subtly affect it. But based on what I'm seeing these ponies have complete mastery of the weather, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'it's like playing with legos, except with mother nature.'</span> </p><p>Twilight and Applejack went back to their discussion and chatter while I continue to gawk at the spectacle above me, much to Applebloom's amusement. Eventually the two concluded their business and with a hefty sack of apples we parted ways and headed back to the Library, or so I thought. </p><p>&quot;Do we have to? I just can't, what's the word I’m looking for. <i>Deal</i> with her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's the matter Rodney? Finally there’s somepony that can put you in place?&quot; Twilight teased.</p><p>&quot;Please Twilight you know you’re the only mare for me.&quot; Her face suddenly started to glow red, that is, until I cast my trademark mischievous grin at her. &quot;It's just that she's so....*sigh* You know what? Forget about it. What are we doing there anyway?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Applejack said that she met Rarity earlier today, apparently she was looking for you and Spike. Probably done with your new attire.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Already? That was pretty fast, I expected making an entire set would take at least three days.&quot; Despite my hesitation to meet the ivory unicorn again I kept remembering how Applebloom cringed when she sniffed me, a proper indication I need a fresh new set of clothes. </p><p>&quot;Rarity is an extremely talented seamstress, I wouldn't be surprised if she made <i>several</i> sets for you. By the way are you going to eat that apple or would you prefer some of these cupcakes?&quot; She opened the box with her magic to reveal several colorful cupcakes.</p><p>&quot;Nah, I'll stick with the apple. Thanks anyways.&quot; As tantalizing as those cupcakes looked, the bright red apple in my hand looked too good to pass up. But considering how it was given to me I rubbed it across my sleeve before taking a bite.</p><p><i>'...........'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several seconds before, on the road to Sweet Apple Acres.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Ah like him, he's funny.&quot; Applebloom stated as she trotted by her big sister.</p><p>&quot;Ah guess he's an a'right kind of pony. Although ah'm starting to feel sorry fer Twilight, I reckon he's quite the troublemaker.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If he's a troublemaker how come yah gave him an apple?&quot; Applejack nuzzled her sister gently at her innocence. </p><p>&quot;Not the bad kind Applebloom, more like them critters that keeps getting into trouble now and again. As as for the apple, well call it business smarts. Ah'm sure he'll be clamoring for more.&quot; </p><p>&quot;How'd you figure that?&quot;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">&quot;APPLEJACK! Get your flank back here so I can kiss it!!&quot;</span> with a blush Applejack beamed as the familiar voice continued to echo away from Ponyville. </p><p>&quot;Oh, just a feeling.&quot; The two siblings continue to make their way back home as Applejack trotted with a new spring to her steps as she looked forward to her new customer. </p><p>And the bits he'll bring.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: I now realize why there were very few fics that included Peewee, since he only got less than 30 second air time we really know nothing about him. Heck I don't even know what gender he is, I'm using 'he' since Peewee sounds like a guy's name to me. Anyways since season 3 is on the horizon I decided to post pone Rodney's adventure with Peewee until I can get more info. </p><p>Now some of you may remember that I mention how the story will start to move on at a quicker pace, however right now Rodney is still just settling down on Ponyville. So the story will still revolve around daily routines every two chapters, though that's subject to change depending on the plot. </p><p>Oh and I finally get to introduce one of the CMC's! YAY! I myself am getting giddy just thinking of all the chaos those three will wreck upon Rodney's life. So look forward to that. </p><p>And as usual please leave comments and criticize my work, especially if anyone is starting to have problems with the story's pacing. </p><p>And things are working well with my new editor though it's still a bit early to tell but I'm starting to fall into a writing patter so updates should come at a predictable pattern, unless life gets in the way. So again give credit to Noxxels for his effort. </p><p>Did you enjoy your little time with Rodney Pinkie? </p><p>.......</p><p>Hey Pinkie you in-oh. Another one. </p><blockquote><p>Dear Zai, </p><p>Heading to Noxxels place.</p><p>-Pinkie Pie</p></blockquote><p>Oh boy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.25em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 16 - Ponies aren't so innocent after all<br/>Edited by Noxxels.</p><p>AN: Sorry for the delay, had to convince America to take me in.</p><hr/><p>The front door swung open violently, nearly dislodging the small bell above as it rung loudly signalling our arrival. I almost doubled over the sack of apples I was carrying as Twilight kept pushing me through with both front hooves on my back hurrying me in to escape the eyes of the townsfolk outside until we were well within what I assumed was Rarity's place of business and home. Immediately after Twilight used her magic to close the door and pull down the blinders on all the windows. </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh that was so embarrassing! By Celestia how could you scream something like that in the middle of town?! As if nearly burning down the library wasn't enough now everypony's going to start spreading rumors.&quot; She fell to the floor out of breath, hoping somehow the floor would swallow her up. &quot;Are you even listening to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my god this is so good. The hell did she put in these? Aahh dammit who gives a crap.&quot; I mumbled while grabbing another fresh apple from the sack. In all my life I've never tasted an apple like this before, especially not from that artificial crap they try to sell off as juices and drinks. It had just the right balance of sweet and sour that brought out the refreshing taste of apples. Even more amazing was the texture, it was firm enough to give a wonderful snap and crunch as I bite into it and yet it was still tender and full of sweet, wonderful, natural juice that flooded my taste buds.</p><p>&quot;Twilight is that you? Oh wonderful! You brought your friend with you.&quot; Rarity was making her way down the stairs wearing glasses followed by several tools of her trade which were wrapped in the same translucent light-blue aura as her horn was.</p><p>&quot;Sup.&quot; I replied, or tried to. What came out was just somewhere between sputtering and grunting while I continued to stuff my mouth with my newly discovered addiction.</p><p>&quot;Lovely, another who shares Applejack's mannerism.&quot; She let out a heavy sigh. &quot;But enough of that I-Twilight why are you drenched in sweat dear?&quot; Rarity trotted towards Twilight, both puzzled and irritated at her less than presentable condition. </p><p>&quot;Didn't you hear him scream several minutes ago?&quot; Twilight replied while still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>&quot;That was you!?&quot; Rarity screamed pointing a hoof at me, I shrugged. &quot;Well, <i>clearly </i>somepony needs to learn some civility. Come Twilight, let's get you freshened up.&quot; Twilight followed Rarity up the stairs while giving me another irritated look before disappearing to the second floor. Had I been thinking clearly I might have realized that allowing two females to talk alone in private and getting ideas was a bad idea, instead I was too busy moving on to my fourth apple to care.</p><p>After several minutes and another apple down my gullet the two mares descended the stairs with Twilight looking much happier.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Too happy. Something's wrong here.'</span></p><p>&quot;Rodney stop eating already you're going to spoil dinner. How many have you eaten?&quot; I lifted my left hand holding four apple cores for Twilight to see. &quot;I only bought twelve and they were supposed to last a week!&quot; Much to my dismay, Twilight lifted the apple sack away from me before I could grab it. &quot;Besides how do you think Rarity will feel if the clothes she made for you no longer fit?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please Twily I doubt a few apples would do that much. Although it does raise a question, Rarity how did you manage to get my measurements? I know for a fact you have no experience in making anything for a human. The staff back at the castle merely mimicked my original clothes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney I have spent an entire day watching you clean Twilight's kitchen, that might not sound like much but I've been in the fashion business all my life. Seeing you toil and flex as you work has given me more than enough to start with.&quot; I'm not sure if it's just me being me or just me high on sugar from the apples, in any case I wasn't about to ignore such a perfect setup.</p><p>&quot;Is that what you were doing? You have no idea how relieved I am to hear that.&quot;</p><p>Rarity raised an eyebrow at me quizzically, &quot;What ever do you mean?&quot;</p><p>It took quite a bit of effort to hold back my smile, though by now I'm starting to get used to it, &quot;Well you see Rarity, I did notice how you were eyeing me up and down while I was working. At first I thought it was simple curiosity, after all I am the only human in Equestria.&quot; I got up and started to walk towards her. &quot;But then I realized you're not just looking at me, you were also <i>looking</i> at me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry dear I still don't follow.&quot; Rarity was glancing to Twilight somewhat nervous as I continue to close in on her.</p><p>&quot;Think about it, a female looking <i>intently</i> towards a dirty and sweaty male as he continued to labor about.&quot; Rarity's eyes slowly widened while her pupil shrunk as the dots connected. &quot;I must admit I'm not used to such attention from someone before, that's not to say that I find it uncomfortable, I already had half the mind to start stripping.&quot; I wasn't really sure if she understood that last comment considering ponies were almost always nude, but it didn't matter. With her face flushed and beet red Rarity had tried several times to speak out and defend her honor, but every time all that came out was incomprehensible blabbering. &quot;And seeing as how you enjoy watching me work I thought you might have been one of those dominating types. A pity really,&quot;I stopped in front of her and leaned in to whisper in her ear, &quot;truth be told I've always been interested, care to satisfy my curiosity?&quot; I was expecting her to continue stammering and blabbering on and maybe start scooting away from me, instead....</p><p>&quot;The depends, exactly how far do you want to go?&quot; As if Rarity's sultry voice wasn't enough she actually bit and nibbled on my ear. The sudden sting and wetness caused me to jerk back on reflex with too much force making me tumble backwards several steps before landing hard on my ass. Rarity started to laugh out loud in a less than ladylike manner, followed by Twilight soon after. &quot;Please darling, did you really think you were the only one who knows how to play this game? Did you like my acting? Mother always said I had potential in the acting career.&quot; Both mares continue to laugh with Twilight enjoying it a bit more to see me eat my own medicine.</p><p><i>'I really can't handle that one.'</i> I slumped to the floor and waited for the laughter to die off.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well at least we know one thing.'</span></p><p><i>'Which is?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'These ponies aren't so innocent after all.'</span></p><br/><p>After the laughter turned to snickers which turned to the sound of heavy breathing as the two mares try to catch their breath, the three of us eventually made our way to the back of the store to pick up my clothes and what appeared to be a green vest shirt for Spike. Now I may be a manchild, but even I could appreciate the quality and effort Rarity invested into my new threads. Although a bit more elaborate the pants and shirt were still considered simple, unlike the ones from the castle staff these fit much better and didn't have any stitching sticking out at odd places underneath. However Rarity decided to get a bit more creative when it came to my hoodie, in fact I'm not sure if I can still call it that. From the chest up it looked like a hoodie but it extended down all the way until just below my knees making it look like a trench coat. What's more, each piece of clothing had designs and colors that worked with my chains to make them feel like they're also part of the attire, while still keeping the same color scheme as before. How she managed to make two clashing accessories work together is beyond me, but then again I don’t have much fashion sense so what do I know.</p><p>&quot;Sooo? How does it feel? Do you like it?&quot; I was a bit surprised to see her actually care and worry about what I think, I guess that's what you call professionalism, or maybe she's just like that.</p><p>&quot;Rarity this is amazing! I actually don't look like a convicted criminal.&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'really?'</span></p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; Twilight yelled.</p><p>&quot;Sorry Rarity, I didn't mean it like that. I'm just surprise you actually managed to make someone in shackles looks presentable, more than presentable actually. It actually looks cool.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Cool</i>?&quot; Rarity let out a heavy sigh. &quot;He's Applejack and Rainbow Dash all in one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<b>BURP!</b> Sorry, apples are acting up.&quot; I said while patting my stomach, Twilight just face hoofed.</p><p>Rarity gave me an unapproving glare, &quot;Definitely more Applejack though. But enough of that, Twilight could you please come with me for a minute?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I have this idea of enchanting certain cloth with simple illusion spells to see if there's any potential. Problem is I have no idea where to start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I'll help, but I can't stay long. Spike should be on his way back home soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It'll just take a minute I promise, please?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well if it doesn't take too-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Marvelous! Come now I already have a test project ready upstairs.&quot; Rarity started to pull Twilight away.</p><p>&quot;Wait Rarity you don't have to-Rodney wait in the front and don't do anything till I get back!&quot; Twilight shouted.</p><p>&quot;What am I going to do? Burn the the buildi-nevermind forget I said anything.&quot; But before Twilight could reply, both unicorns disappeared up the stairs. I waited for a second before making my way towards the apple sack, but before I even got close it was wrapped in purple aura and flew up the stairs. &quot;Really Twilight!?&quot; I shouted. With a grunt I picked up Twilight's saddlebag and the cupcakes before making my way to the front of the store.</p><p>It wasn't long before the boredom started to suffocate me and I started to wander about the store hoping to find something interesting to pass the time. Unfortunately that idea didn't work out. There was nothing that caught my eye considering my lack of interest in fashion. I was about to give up and mess around with magic when my eyes fell upon a light purple chest decorated with what looked like a giant emerald gem in the front. In most cases, I wasn't the type to snoop around a female's drawer or anything, but since these are ponies I doubt I'll accidentally find any underwear.</p><p><i>'Let's see what's behind door number.......oh sweet lord these ponies are loaded.'</i> For a brief moment I was blinded by the sudden flash of brilliant colors before realizing what it was. <i>'These can't be real can they? They gotta be fakes.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Normally I would agree, but seeing as we're inside a fashion store for ponies...'</span></p><p><i>'Point taken, but I still doubt their real. Look how big some of them are!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'One problem, they don't have anything that comes remotely close to creating artificial gemstones.'</span></p><p><i>'Magic then?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'The only logical explanation.'</span></p><p><i>'You realize how crazy that sounds?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Which? The magic part or talking-with-a-voice-inside-your-head part?'</span></p><p>I continued to explore the chest while contemplating the state of my mental health when I saw something moving inside. At first I thought it was the lights reflecting off the many gems playing tricks on me, yet despite any movement some of the reflected lights were, in fact, moving. It was only after moving away some of the larger pieces of gems that I found the cause. It was a ruby, considerably small compared to the rest but still considered unnaturally large in my world, and it was glowing. Again, for the second time, I thought it was merely the lights playing tricks on me, but after closing the lid to cut the light it kept giving off a red glow around it. What's even more interesting was how the light coming from the gem was moving by itself as if alive, I picked it up and brought it closer to my to peer deeper into it.</p><p><i>'Oh my god. It's burning.'</i> There really isn't much you can describe it, there in the very center of the gem was a burning fire. It's flames licking and dancing about making the light it generated dance with it, only after several moments did I realize how warm it was. Not only was it giving off light but warmth as well, the fact that it was generating them both simply out of nothing defied the common laws of nature.</p><p><i>'So it is mag-wait! SHIT!'</i> Suddenly the fire inside radically faded and before I could do anything, it winked out. The ruby stopped glowing, it stopped giving off heat and even lost some of its luster.</p><p>&quot;Rarity's going to kill m-<span style="font-size:1.75em">AAAAAAARGH!!!</span>&quot; I fell to the floor writhing about as blinding pain jolted through my head. Every heartbeat felt like my brain was growing twice its size, every beat ending with mind breaking pain. I didn't care how loud I was screaming, how I was kicking my legs out, randomly hitting and breaking any unfortunate objects near me, all I could feel at the moment was pain. I wasn't aware how hard I was clutching my head, didn't feel my nails biting in and drawing blood, I had imagined trying to dig my way into my head and wrenching out my brain to stop the pain. The world around me was muffled and gray, I could see and hear ponies running towards me but they felt so far away.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Moments before.....]</p></div><p>&quot;...so in order for the illusion to last a night it needs another magic source?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct, cloth is a very inefficient material for holding magic, silk even more so. I'm not entirely sure of other materials but I still doubt any of them could be used effectively with enchantments.&quot; Although it had taken longer than either mares intended, both were too engrossed with the challenge to notice, especially Twilight who had turned into one of her lecture moods and was having the time of her life.</p><p>&quot;I guess I could have a battery gem stored under the folds, or maybe even use it a part of the dress.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would work but then you have to cast a spell to feed the enchantment with said energy source, and that spell requires a focused mind to maintain. I don't think anypony is willing to wear something that's going to give them a headache, especially for an entire night. Plus battery gems are notoriously expensive, the only other viable materials are some metals. But I also don't think anypony wants to wear a dress laced with heavy metals. You also need more metal to hold more magic for more powerful enchantments.&quot; Twilight suddenly imagined seeing a poor mare wearing laced metal armor to the Grand Galloping Gala which caused her to giggle a bit.</p><p>&quot;I guess it really is impossible, and here I was hoping to be the first pony to make one.&quot; Rarity had heard over several small talks and a few magazines of ponies experimenting with spells to create dazzling effects. But nopony were ever successful, at least not to a point where it becomes efficient enough to be worth while. The actual weaving and enchantment wasn't much of a problem though it still requires some skill, it was trying to keep the enchantment active long enough to last a dinner or a party. Rarity had tried using a simple 'glimmer' enchantment and it only lasted forty-five minutes, to have even more consuming and complex enchantments last an entire night is close to impossible.</p><p>&quot;Sorry Rarity but I don't really see this ever taking off as it is. Maybe somepony in the future will figure it out.&quot;</p><p>Rarity's head sank as she let out a sigh in disappointment, &quot;And I was lucky enough to find a fire ruby to use too. At least it'll make a nice-&quot;</p><p><span style="font-size:1.75em">AAAAAAARGH!!!</span></p><p>Both mares jumped up in fright by the sudden scream originating from down below, both mares stared at each other in a second of hesitation before running down the stairs. As Twilight and Rarity made their way downstairs as fast as possible, the screams were now joined with the sound of tumbling objects and breaking glass. It sounded like Rodney was fighting something and losing badly. Fearing the worst, Twilight started to gather magic in her horn, prepared to weave it to any spell she would need. Both mares soon stood at the base of the stairs looking about the destruction, expecting somepony or something to come out and attack them. Luckily neither saw anything remotely dangerous except for Rodney who was still screaming and thrashing about on the floor surrounded by broken furniture, gemstones and glass, some were stabbing into him yet he didn't seem to care. His hands were bloodied from the many small wounds around his head and he had several bruises either from hitting the floor or one of the furniture around him.</p><p>&quot;Rodney what's wrong!?&quot; Twilight ran up to him only to have one of his legs kick her in the sides, sending her off with a grunt.</p><p>&quot;Twilight!&quot; Rarity ran to Twilight's side. &quot;Twilight are you ok?&quot;</p><p>With another grunt Twilight got up on her hooves, &quot;I'm fine Rarity, it just grazed me. Don't worry it looks worse than it is, it's Rodney I'm worried about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What' wrong with him? Why is he hurting himself like that?&quot; Rarity was afraid but not for herself, whatever's happening it was happening to Rodney.</p><p>&quot;I don't know! Oh Celestia I don't know!&quot; The smudges of blood on the floor were getting larger as the human continued to bleed from his many wounds.</p><p>&quot;We need to stop him from hurting himself!&quot; Rarity's horn started to glow brightly as she attempted to restrain Rodney to the floor. Rarity's spell started to form around Rodney's legs but just as it appeared it quickly vanished. &quot;Why isn't it-&quot;</p><p><span style="font-size:2em">&quot;AAAAAAARRGH!!&quot;</span> The screams suddenly intensified and Rodney's started to thrash ever more violently, even starting to pull small bits of hair from his head.</p><p>&quot;Twilight it's getting worse! We need to get him to Ponyville Hospital!&quot; But Twilight didn't move, she just stood there staring at Rodney.</p><p>&quot;I know what's wrong.&quot; Twilight said under her breath, Rarity could barely hear her over the screams.</p><p>&quot;Then do something!&quot; Twilight bolted forward with a limp towards Rodney. &quot;Twilight wait- you-he's going to-&quot;</p><p>But instead of trying to hoof handle him as Rarity thought, Twilight suddenly stopped just barely out of the human's reach, &quot;Rodney listen to me! You have too much magic in you! You have to get rid of it! Rodney! Can you hear me!?&quot; Twilight feared there was too much pain and little room left for Rodney to concentrate, most likely Rodney would attempt to release raw magic in desperation which easily harm somepony or himself. There is another way, but she swore to the Princesses she would only do so with their blessing. &quot;Listen to me Rodney! Focus! Remember the training, use only harmless spells! Choose one that requires least amount of focus but uses a lot of magic!&quot; There was nothing else she could do without breaking her oath. If Rodney chooses to release pure raw magic there’s a chance he himself might not survive the explosion. </p><p>A sudden force hit Twilight like a wall sending her hurtling towards a large ponysized triple mirror, luckily Rarity was quick enough to envelop Twilight in her magic and stop her mid air only several feet away from impact. Rarity ran up to Twilight a second time but just as she reached her something caught her eye, &quot;Twilight are you...you. Oh by the stars.&quot; Twilight shook her head to clear her head before turning towards Rarity whose jaw was slack open in awe, Twilight followed her gaze and she too couldn't believe what she saw.</p><p>A miniature sun, that was the only way to properly describe the scene. A giant ball of azure fire was forming around Rodney as he hovered in mid air just a few feet above the floor. <i>'This is it.'</i> Twilight thought. <i>'I should have taken it off while I still had the chance, now it's too late.'</i> A flash of blue in the corner of Twilight's vision caught her attention, she turned and saw one of Rarity's gems floating in midair next to her surrounded by azure fire. <i>'Why is it floating?'</i> Slowly more azure fire erupted out of nowhere at random around her, everything that the fire licked started to float up and hover in the air.</p><p>&quot;Twilight what's happening!&quot; Rarity's cry jolted Twilight out of her confusion. She turned back towards Rodney and saw that the ball of fire had grown to twice its size, and was still growing at a frightening pace.</p><p>&quot;Rarity stay near me!&quot; Twilight's horn glowed and a large translucent purple sphere surrounded the two mares, the fire that was caught within suddenly died, causing several object to fall back to the floor. Both stood still as the more and more objects continue to float and hover all the while the ball of fire continue to engulf everything in its path. Soon the two mares could see nothing but azure fire surrounding them yet never going pass the purple barrier. And then Twilight felt it, at first she believed it came from all the floating objects around them, but another tremor came and much stronger than the last.</p><p>Then Carousel Boutique started groan and shake.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Outside....]</p></div><p>&quot;Get everypony not in the effort to steer clear!&quot; shouted Mayor Mare. A large number of ponies darted back and forth from the burning building, pegasi in the sky and earth ponies with buckets. The only one that stood still were unicorns that decided to help with their magic, controlling the water and even throwing dirt over the building. &quot;Where is the emergency weather team?! We need more rain clouds!&quot; There were already a large concentration of black clouds above Carousel Boutique which came remarkably fast thanks Ponyville's one and only Rainbow Dash. However, despite the heavy downpour it did nothing, the fire just kept growing and and spreading as if nothing happened.</p><p>&quot;Nothing's working! Are you sure this is a normal fire?!&quot; shouted a black pegasus.	</p><p>&quot;What'd you think Thunderlane?! 'Course it ain't normal! It’s blue for crying out loud!&quot; shouted his companion.</p><p>&quot;You two can it! Thunderlane stop complaining and start jumping!&quot; Rainbow Dash flew in with her trademark rainbow colored trail behind her carrying another large rain cloud with her. With it she pushed a white depleted cloud below Thunderlane away, he immediately started to jump on top of the new rain cloud causing a heavy downpour on the building. This was his fifth already and still it did nothing worth noticing, the building on fire kept burning.</p><p>Rainbow Dash started to hover around the building, she too had her suspicion about the real nature of the fire. For one how come the building still looked normal, second <i>'where the buck is the smoke and heat?'</i> Rainbow Dash made another attempt to peer inside the building, no one knew where Rarity is nor Twilight. Several ponies mentioned seeing Twilight going in but the fire was too thick to see through and nopony, Rainbow hoped to Celestia those ponies were wrong. </p><p>Suddenly she heard something groan and thought it was Rarity, but it was a deep rumble and it didn't sound like something anypony would make. Another groan and this time it was deeper and louder than before, Dash's eyes shot wide in fear when she saw the top of the building start to shake. &quot;EVERYPONY CLEAR OUT!! IT'S GONNA FALL!!&quot;</p><p>The effect was immediate as everypony nearby started to gallop in frenzy to get as far away from the building as possible, all except Rainbow Dash. <i>'I'm not taking any chances!'</i> she reared up and with a giant beat of her wings, lunged through the air towards the nearest window.</p><p>She didn't even make it halfway before several pegasi caught her mid flight, &quot;Are you crazy! You can't go in there! It's suicide!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let go! I'm not leaving them hanging in there! Celestia dammit! LET GO!&quot; Rainbow bucked and thrashed as far as she could but none of them let go. &quot;They're inside! I know they are! You gotta let me-NOOOOOO!&quot; Carousel Boutique let out another deep rumble before it started to tip dangerously to the side. Rainbow Dash closed her eyes awaiting the inevitable sound of of impact, the sound of wood and glass breaking that would steal away her two best friends. But after seconds which felt like minutes no such sound was heard, in fact she could hear nothing at all expect the sound of wings flapping around her.</p><p>Slowly Rainbow Dash opened her eyes only to have it shot wide open and jaws agape to what she saw. The building was still on fire and it was still tilted, however it had tilted towards the opposite side from before and yet somehow despite the damage the building still looked relatively intact.</p><p>&quot;How is it...&quot; Rainbow's eyes darted downward to the base of the building and her jaw fell even further and for a moment even forgot to flap her wings causing her and several ponies still holding her to fall a few feet. &quot;It's floating....it’s actually floating.&quot; Still engulfed in blue fire Carousel Boutique continue to tilt from side to side as it floated several meters above the ground like it was sitting just barely over a cliff except it never fell, it just swiveled and tilted towards another side.</p><p>Suddenly the fires started to disappear and the building floated back down towards the earth, when it was only several feet above ground it went free fall and with a deafening crash touch the earth again creating dust clouds and scattering debris, several seconds later more crashing sounds followed from inside the building. Silence fell upon the town of Ponyville, all that gathered either to help or to watch, now stood still all staring with slack jaws. Suddenly the silence was broken by a voice that nopony other than Rainbow Dash recognized. </p><br/><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.75em">&quot;HOLY SHIT THAT HURTS!!&quot;</span></p><hr/><p>AN: Well this was certainly an exciting chapter to write. If anyone is a bit confused with what happen don't worry I'll go back and add more information in the next chapter. </p><p>And as usual give me comments and critics please, anything that turns you off with my writing and such.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 17 - She's into it like Rarity<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>&quot;Mayor Mare?&quot; Twilight poked her head into the office room. </p><p>&quot;Twilight, yes please come in.&quot; Twilight tentatively trotted inside and stood in front of the mayor's office table. &quot;I'm sure you're aware why I've called here Twilight.&quot; The mayor's expression made Twilight feel uneasy, it wasn't anger, it reminded Twilight of those very rare occasions where she performed subpar in school. Twilight hated disappointing her teachers, especially Celestia. </p><p>&quot;It’s about Rodney, isn’t it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The human, yes. I was informed by both Princesses, and by you as well, that everypony in Ponyville would be safe with him living here. Twilight I do not feel safe, and after what happened today, I'm sure other ponies would agree.&quot; Twilight's head hung low while trying to avoid looking at the mayor directly. Even though Twilight may not have been responsible for these incidents, she had agreed to oversee Rodney's progress while in Ponyville. This, by extension, meant that she did share some responsibility for his actions. Whether they were intentional or not. </p><p>&quot;He didn't mean to cause any of them, they were all accidents.&quot; She knew it was a weak argument.</p><p>&quot;Whether they were intentional or not, the facts still remain. Did he not nearly burn down your home on his very first day in Ponyville?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes but that was-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And only two days after caused chaos and panic to the town when he, and I quote, <i>destroyed the property of Rarity Belle, set fire to her home, and then caused it to float five meters above ground.</i> Are these reports accurate?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The building was never really on fire, and again, it was all an accident.&quot; Mayor Mare’s gaze didn't waver.</p><p>&quot;Twilight, the only reason I allowed him to live in Ponyville was because both Princess Celestia and Luna requested it. <i>Requested</i>, not ordered. I'm sorry Twilight, but as mayor, the safety of everypony is my responsibility. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the human to leave Ponyville. I believe you will agree that it is safer for him to go back to the castle.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I know he'll be safer there, but it's like a cage to him. Princess Celestia wants him to live like any other pony, and the only way to do that is if he lives with other ponies.&quot; Twilight had been observing Rodney's behavior, it was easy to tell how his mindset was similar to a foal. And everypony knows that if a foal stays locked up in a place, no matter how big, for too long they'll throw a tantrum. In Rodney's case, a foal with enough magical potential to destroy all of Equestria, and he nearly did that already.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry Twilight but it's for the best, he'll be safer there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly, he'll be monitored and watched every second of everyday. He won't be allowed to be on his own or learn. Mayor, I know what his track record says and I completely agree with you, he's a walking disaster. But, that's only because he's still learning about his powers and how to live with them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes I'm aware of that Twilight but-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the only way he'll continue to learn is through experience. None of these disasters ever happened in the castle because everything he did was watched and tightly guarded. He knows how to control his abilities that he can, but there are some that's just natural to him. Unless he learns, <i>properly</i> learns to live with his abilities he'll be stuck inside the castle the rest of his life like a cage.&quot; Twilight realized that she had been yelling and was now out of breath. &quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to start shouting like that.&quot; Surprisingly, the mayor started to chuckle.</p><p>Mayor Mare let out a long sigh and stared at the space in front of her, not really looking at anything in particular, but deep in thought as she contemplated Twilight's reasoning. After about five minutes, which felt far longer to Twilight, Mayor Mare come to a decision. &quot;Very well, he can stay.&quot; It took about a second for it to sink in and when it did Twilight's eyes burst open along with a smile wide across her face, she even started to bounce around the office much like Pinkie Pie. </p><p>&quot;Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you-&quot; The mayor's smiled briefly at her behavior before turning back serious.</p><p>&quot;But!&quot; Twilight lost all momentum and froze mid air for a second before coming crashing down to the floor. &quot;I believe you when you say that both incidents were not intentional, but accident or not, he still broke the law and that has consequences. But seeing as it wasn't intentional and nopony was hurt,&quot; Twilight tried to shrink as small as possible somehow hoping to hide the small scratches and bruises on her body. &quot;...much, I'll be lenient. Community service, the punishment will help drive the lesson deeper.&quot; Twilight let out a long, relieved sigh as the tension left the room. </p><p>Slowly a grin starts to spread across her face, &quot;I think I have a good idea where he can start, Rarity and I were just discussing it.&quot; She giggled before starting to elaborate on what Rarity had suggested earlier in the day while she helped Twilight freshen up.</p><p>&quot;Yes I believe that would be perfect, so long as he stops setting anything, or anypony, on fire again.&quot; Said Mayor Mare while giving approving nods. </p><p>&quot;He didn't set-ah never mind.&quot; Right now Twilight didn't really care to explain, she was just too happy to had convinced the mayor. </p><p>&quot;Where is he anyway? I only saw you carry him out the building before galloping off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well after everything settled down he passed out on the floor. I took him to Ponyville Hospital since he had the most and worst injuries, they’re treating him right now, albeit somewhat reluctantly. But don't worry, the biggest threat is infection, and since we got him there so quickly, there's very little chance of that happening. Too bad he woke up when we arrived.&quot; Mayor Mare caught the worry tone in Twilight's last comment. </p><p>&quot;Why? Does he not like hospitals? Twilight I can't have him burn down the town's only-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No never, I'm sure the ordeal left him completely empty. It's just that since Ponyville is a small town the hospital doesn't really have much diversity in medical potions and salves since most ailments can be treated magically.&quot; The mayor look confused and bade Twilight to elaborate. &quot;Basically magic doesn't work on him and since a great majority of our medical prowess relies on magic, the doctor has no choice but to use a more <i>direct</i> approach. Doctor said that he needs several stitches on some injuries made from all the broken glass.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Mayor Mare felt genuinely sympathetic for the human, despite the trouble he caused. </p><p>&quot;Worse, we can't put him to sleep or alleviate the pain. I don't know how anypony can go through something like that.&quot; Twilight's ears fell flat while her eyes slowly widened in fear. &quot;I...I think I better go check on him. I'm sure he won't do anything drastic and all. But, you know...just in case.&quot; Twilight took several uneasy steps backward before galloping to the door, but stopped and turned around right before. &quot;And sorry again for shouting out like that, not sure what came over me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright Twilight, only shows how much you care.&quot; The mayor spoke the last part softly. </p><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; Twilight asked with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>&quot;Nothing, forget about it.&quot; Mayor Mare smiled gently at Twilight before she started to gallop out the room, the clopping of her hooves receded  and disappeared once she was gone out the front door. &quot;That mare really needs to get out more.&quot; With a sigh, Mayor Mare picked up a rolled up scroll and dropped it to the nearby trash bin before getting back to work. So far the only contribution from the human was to point out flaws in the town's emergency procedure, something Mayor Mare was about to correct.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later, in Ponyville Hospital....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney? How are you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;<b>AH!</b> Goddammit, you said you've done this before!&quot; Sharp pain shot through me again as the white earth pony with a red cross mark on her flank continued to stitch close a particularly large wound behind my shoulder. I had thought to ask how she was both holding the needle and making stitches at the same time, but it was probably one of those things you're better off not knowing. </p><p>&quot;Will you please stop moving, you're only making this harder for yourself. I said I have some experience in stitching, I never said it was on anypony. And stop screaming, this is a hospital. Honestly, I've known foals that deal with needles better than you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only because they're too young to know evil when they see-<b>AH!</b> You know what, I'm starting to suspect that you're getting some sick pleasure out of <b>THIS!</b>&quot; I yelped out the last bit as the nurse continue to force the needle through my skin.</p><p>&quot;I have no idea what you're talking about. Ah Miss Sparkle, come in. I'm just about done with him.&quot; I followed the nurse's gaze to see Twilight entering the room. &quot;How are you feeling? Are those injuries giving you any trouble?&quot; </p><p>&quot;I'm fine, Nurse Redheart, thank you for asking but they only look worse than they actually are. It's just mildly irritating.&quot; Twilight trotted forward and sat on her haunches in front of me. &quot;I'm sorry I had to leave so quickly after dropping him off earlier, I hope he didn't give the hospital too much trouble.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aside from the initial confusion from the doctors and trying to keep him quiet, we've handled worse.&quot; I felt a small tug on my back causing another jolt of pain from my shoulder which made me shout out of reflex. &quot;And done, that's the last of them.&quot; I felt her hooves lift off of my back as she fell on all fours. &quot;You know, you're extremely lucky that none of your injuries proved serious or fatal, none of the doctors or vets know anything about your physiology.&quot; She moved in front of me to stand beside Twilight. &quot;I would like to apply some salves, but since nopony knows how you'll react, your wounds will have to heal by themselves. Which means taking it easy and try to move as little as possible.&quot; I let out a sigh and moved my shoulder experimentally which caused several wounds to make me grunt in pain. &quot;What did I just say?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just trying to get a feel for it. How long till they heal?&quot; Slowly I reached out and grabbed my clothes from the nearby table. </p><p>&quot;Well if you heal like any other pony I would guess that most of them would heal in a week or two, but that large gash will take far longer. You're in for a painful month.&quot; </p><p><i>'Wonderful.'</i></p><p>Twilight looked at me with concern, &quot;Is there really nothing you can give him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not without knowing its full effects. But if we can draw some blood for tests, then let the doctors analyze and experiment on it then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;See, you do enjoy riddling me with holes.&quot; I turned to Twilight. &quot;She's into it like Rarity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; I chuckled while the nurse looked confused. </p><p>&quot;I'm just joking Twilight, calm down.&quot; I looked at the nurse with a smile. &quot;Thank you Nurse Redheart for dressing my wounds and sorry for making you go through with it. I'm sure stitching me up like a doll must have been very unpleasant, again I'm sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, looks like there's hope for you yet. And it's quite alright dear, I may not like it but it's part of the job and somepony has to do it.&quot; She trotted off towards the door. &quot;I'll be back to take some samples of your blood.&quot; And with that, she left. </p><p>I lifted the shirt above my head and managed to poke my head through it without it touching or pulling on the bandage around my head, but as it came down my back it tug on some of the stitching that stood out which caused me to grunt again in pain. &quot;So, what actually happened back there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was hoping you can tell me, from what I could tell it looks as if you suddenly absorbed a large amount of magic, well beyond what you can control.&quot; I let out a sigh before going delving back to my memories, but it didn't take long for me to pinpoint what went wrong. </p><p>&quot;Well after you and Rarity went upstairs I got bored and started wondering off, found a chest with gems inside. By the way are those gemstones real?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean by <i>real</i>?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are gemstones right? Rubies, sapphires, diamonds, etc. Did Rarity buy them or something? I've never seen gems that size before, they must've cost her a fortune.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not sure what you’re talking about Rodney, Rarity usually finds the gems she needs with Spike near the mountains.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait wait wait. Are you telling me that she just goes off one morning and just finds them? Just starts digging them up somewhere?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes? Why does it matter?&quot; I let out a long sigh while rubbing the sides of my head through the bandages. </p><p>&quot;Nothing, just hope my world and yours never connect ever again. It won't be pretty.&quot; Twilight was about to inquire further, but I cut her off. &quot;Anyways, while I was looking through the gems I found this one ruby that was giving off light and heat all on its own. At the time my curiosity got the better of me so I picked it up, should have realized the thing was magical. Obviously I drained it empty before I could stop myself and the next thing I know my brain feels like it's burning from the inside out.&quot; I let out another sigh of frustration. <i>'You would think after nearly burning down Twilight's home it'll be enough to teach me a lesson.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well nothing like mind breaking pain to drive it home.'</span></p><p>&quot;It's called a fire ruby and yes it's magical, <i>very</i> magical.&quot; I let out another sigh, Twilight was about to go into one of her lecturing moods again. &quot;They’re called arcane gems and are <i>extremely</i> rare. Basically, they’re gemstones infused with a large amount of magic. When magic naturally starts to gather, it becomes denser and attracts more magic around itself. In most cases, once it reaches a certain point it would be absorbed by nearby living creatures and even plants. This process is known as the natural cycle of magic.&quot; Despite my mood and the throbbing pain from my many injuries, Twilight's impromptu lecture was actually quite interesting. &quot;For magic, anything alive can absorb magic as naturally as breathing, we don't even realize when it happens. However, in rare situations where no living entity is nearby, these collections of magic will start to gather around whatever material is most in tune with magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm assuming gemstones count as one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct. In fact, the tier goes from living creatures as the most in tune, to plants, to gems, and then to certain types of metals. Technically everything in some way is in tune with magic and therefore can hold a certain amount of magic, but the difference is how in tune they are. The closer it is to magic, the more magic it attracts.&quot; </p><p>&quot;So it's all random then? Magic just so happens to gather in a dead area where it just so happens to have some gemstones underneath?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now you know why they’re so rare. We have managed to replicate the effect to what we call as battery-gems, but nopony has ever created one that's to the same level as arcane gems. And even those require a unicorn with skill, is knowledgeable in magic and is born with a large 'container' for magic. It makes them extremely expensive and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I made the one Rarity found completely worthless before destroying her home and property. All because she just wanted to give me a fresh set of clothes.&quot; I rubbed my face in frustration and clenched my teeth in anger. </p><p>&quot;Rodney it's alright, you didn't know any better. It's nopony's fault.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it’s my fault Twilight, I <i>should</i> have known better. Luckily I had my levitation spell, if you hadn't screamed at me like you did...&quot; I gave Twilight a warm grateful smile.</p><p>&quot;I'm surprised you were able to lift so many things at once especially while you were in pain, that must have taken a lot of concentration. Didn't I say to use one that took the least amount of effort?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twily I wasn't thinking at all when I did it, I just used the spell with no real target or focus.&quot; I started to chuckled a bit. &quot;But I definitely didn't expect to lift up Rarity's home like that. How is she by the way? I asked the nurse but it doesn't sound like she's here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rarity came out of it all completely untouched, you and I are the only ones injured and the worse I have was from your kick.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I what!?&quot; Twilight tried to turn away from me and hide the other side of her body. &quot;Twilight let me see.&quot; I said flatly.</p><p>&quot;It's fine Rodney, it was just a-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight, please.&quot; Twilight glanced downward and hesitated by eventually she turned her around. Around the area where left front hoof connected to the body was a large bruise which seemed to affect the color of her coat. I'm not sure why, but the fur on the bruise also showed some discoloring and was now a much lighter shade of purple than the rest of her body, making it plain for everyone to see. &quot;Twilight I'm so sorry.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Like I said, it only grazed me and it just looks bad. It'll change back when it heals.&quot; I was grateful that she tried to make me feel better, too bad it didn't work. I reached out and started to rub her head again just the way she likes it, I could tell because she started to hum and moan again, she even started to push up against my hand for more pressure. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You know, it sounds as if she was-'</span></p><p><i>'Don't you dare say it.'</i></p><p>&quot;Miss Sparkle is everything all-&quot; Nurse Redheart had just walked in halfway through before she started to blush which, thanks to her white coat, made her glow like a headlight. &quot;Oh my I'll...I'll come back later.&quot; Before I could say anything she bolted out the door. I looked down to see Twilight still enjoying herself, completely oblivious to the world. </p><p><i>'I just know that's going to bite us back in the future. Tell her?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Hell no.'</span></p><p>After about another minute of what was now an awkward situation, I withdrew my hand which caused Twilight to look up at me with a pout and puppy dog eyes. &quot;Later, promise. For now let's head on to Rarity's place. I still need to apologize and somehow make up to her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Before that I need to talk to you about something first. I talked to the mayor just after dropping you off, she's having trouble letting you stay in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thought so, in fact I'd be somewhat worried about them if they didn't start to fear me. So when are we-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're not going anywhere.&quot; I looked down at Twilight, confused. &quot;I was able to convince her to let you stay, however, you're on very thin ice Rodney. One more fiasco like today and I doubt anything but a direct order from the Princess will change her mind.&quot; Twilight held up a hoof to emphasize. &quot;Also, you’re going to have to do some community service as punishment. Considering what you did that's very generous of the mayor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what do I do? Build a road? Oh please tell me I'll be working in Applejack's farm.&quot; I'll be content if she can pay me with more apples.</p><p>&quot;Actually I suggested an alternative with the mayor and she agreed it was appropriate, in fact, it was Rarity's idea.&quot;</p><p><i>'Oh crap.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney, from now on you'll be living and working in Carousel Boutique with Rarity.&quot;</p><p><i>'Fuck my life.'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Late at night, in Golden Oaks library....]</p></div><p>&quot;Spike!? Are you home?&quot; Twilight entered her home while carrying a sack of apples and a box of cupcakes, still uneaten. </p><p>&quot;Twilight!&quot; Spike climbed down the stairs and ran up to Twilight. &quot;Is it true? Was Carousel Boutique really on fire!? Is Rarity ok?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Calm down Spike. Yes, Rarity is fine, she wasn't hurt.&quot; Spike let out a sigh of relief but gasped loudly once he got a good look at Twilight. &quot;Oh my gosh, Twilight you’re hurt! I'll go grab the first aid box!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok Spike I can handle it, I was just about to practice my healing spells on them. I just need to review my notes before I do.&quot; Twilight trotted towards her study while magically lifting a large book nearby to the table, opened it, and began reading. </p><p>&quot;Well if you say so. Hey where's the monkey guy?&quot; Spike head poked out the front door but saw no sign of the human anywhere in the vicinity. </p><p>&quot;<i>Rodney</i> won't be living with us any longer.&quot; Before Spike could ask her to elaborate Twilight's horn started to glow along with her entire body. Slowly, the small injuries and cuts on Twilight's body started to heal as well as her coat. The only one left was the bruise from Rodney's kick, even it was a barely visible impression. Twilight inspected her handiwork and gave an approving nod before continuing, &quot;He'll be staying with Rarity from now on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!? Why?&quot; For Spike, the usual stallions going for Rarity was enough competition for him, now this human was already living with her after only a few days.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Spike I doubt he's Rarity's type and as far as I can tell she's not Rodney's either. I told Rarity that I needed to find a place for Rodney to live she offered to provide if Rodney works for her.&quot; Twilight let out a long yawn, the day had been very tiring for her. In fact, ever since Rodney everything's been tiring, having him work at Rarity’s was a great idea and it made sense. Rarity uses a lot of magic for her work which can help Rodney train his magic skills, and even though Spike is more than willing to help he's not always available to help her dig for gems. Plus, her place isn't that far away from Twilight's which meant she could still keep a relatively close eye on Rodney, it all worked out.</p><p>&quot;Well I guess that's ok then, but he better not make a move on Rarity.&quot; Spike tried to take an intimidating posture, but only managed to look adorable to Twilight. &quot;Anyways, you want me to make you anything? Wait. How come we only have apples? And cupcakes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry Spike, but the market was closed today because of the rain. I was lucky enough to meet Applejack in front of Sugarcube Corner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What rain?&quot; Spike raised an eyebrow quizzically at Twilight. </p><p>&quot;What do you mean 'what rain'? Didn't the weather team schedule one for...oh never mind. They must have used the all the rain clouds on Rarity's home.&quot; Twilight let out another tired sigh. &quot;I think I'll head to bed early for tonight. Where's Owlowiscious and Peewee?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Owlowiscious should be upstairs sleeping on his perch, if not then he's most likely outside on a branch. Peewee should be somewhere down in the basement again, I don't know why that bird likes being underground so much.&quot; Spike walked into the kitchen along with the apples and cupcakes. &quot;Do you want to eat these first before you sleep?&quot; Spike shouted. </p><p>&quot;No thank you Spike, I ate an apple on the way home.&quot; Twilight let out another yawn before making her way up the stairs. Once at the top her horn glowed and a small leather bound book floated up from one of Twilight's private drawers along with a quill and ink.</p><p><i>'Might as well I suppose.'</i> Twilight thought.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><br/><i>Observation Report 14,</i></p><p><i>Today another disaster occurred due to negligence on the subject's awareness of his powers.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 18 - I guess these ponies aren't so bad after all<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>&quot;A bit more to the left. No no, too much. Hmmm bring it to the front-oh heavens no, that would never do. Aaaaaand...actually, could you rotate it to the left side for just-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rarity!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh very well you may place it where it is and must you scream like that? It is impolite to shout at a lady.&quot;</p><p><i>'And people wonder why chivalry is a dead.'</i> With a tired sigh I slowly released the levitation spell, causing the large cabinet to hit the floor with a soft thud. &quot;Anything else you need me to do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahem.&quot;</p><p>I pinched the bridge of my nose and let out another long sigh of frustration before continuing, &quot;Is there anything else you would like me to do Miss Rarity?&quot; Surprisingly, I didn't slur the words out. Rarity had, for reasons unknown, taken it upon herself to &quot;make a gentlecolt out of me.&quot; And considering how I trashed her place, ruined her arcane gem, and rotated her home fifteen degrees west, I couldn’t find it in me to deny any of her requests. No matter how absurd. </p><p>Carousel Boutique was, for the most part, still structurally intact, however everything else inside looked like a bull went through it all along with an earthquake and a cyclone. Luckily, being levitated by my overpowered levitation spell kept it inert in the air instead of being thrown about which kept most of the larger furniture intact, the more fragile objects like glass and perfume bottles were broken and littered the floor. </p><p>The first night was spent mostly just clearing the floor of any sharp objects which was easy enough, especially with Twilight’s help. I, on the other hand, didn't really do much. It wasn’t that I didn't try as my guilt kept pushing me to do something to contribute to the effort, but Twilight kept threatening to cut of my supply of magic if I didn't take it easy. Sitting down on my ass watching these mares work, even though they were using magic, still didn't change the fact that they were cleaning up after my mess. </p><p>Twilight left once it got dark but not before giving me another supply of magic, seeing as I was drained empty from my little episode. Of course it was then up to me to explain it to Rarity since Twilight had to leave, I'm not sure how she took it though. She had an interested expression the whole time but it hardly changed so I couldn't tell if she felt comfortable or not. Even after telling her how explosive my natural magic was, she just looked down to the floor deep in thought. She didn't even look remotely fearful of me after I was done. I was a bit confused whether to be thankful or suspicious, maybe she just trusted me since Twilight was pretty comfortable around me. </p><p>Since they only had time to clean the first floor everything else upstairs was still a mess, thus for the night I slept on a large red and overly laced Victorian couch. Somehow, the fact that she has one of these didn't surprise me one bit. Unfortunately due to the injuries on my back I was forced to sleep facing down, a position I was never comfortable with and one the couch wasn't made for. There was however one upside to everything, Rarity still has a fully stocked and workable kitchen despite the mess, and let me tell you, that mare can cook. I would go as far to say that it rivaled castle food, she's that good. Still, it doesn't change the fact that I'm getting really desperate to eat meat, hell I'm starting to get weird ideas about her cat. Apparently she must've sensed it or something cause the little fur ball kept her distance from me. Considering my luck with pets in this world that suits me just fine, especially since this one has fangs and claws. </p><p>But I digress.</p><p>&quot;I believe we've done enough cleaning up for today, there are still other rooms to clean but with this I can at least get back to work. Because of your little fiasco some of my ensembles were damaged and require fixing, luckily none require me to remake them from scratch so it shouldn’t put me behind schedule too much.&quot; I was about to apologize again but Rarity cut me off. &quot;Yes yes I know, it was an accident and you feel sorry I know. Don't worry dear I've forgiven you already, after all you are trying to make it up by working as my new assistant.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Too bad she has to be so aggravating about it.'</span></p><p>&quot;However, as I'll be too busy to do anything else I'll need you to pick up several items from the various shops around Ponyville. Don't worry, I'm a regular at every shop so just mention you work for me and ask for what's on the list.&quot; Rarity levitated a scroll towards me along with a map of the town. The list consisted mostly of materials like several bolts of cloth of a particular color or pattern, one item however didn't seem to make much sense. </p><p>&quot;Hey Rarity what's-&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ahem.&quot; I sighed again out of frustration, something I've been doing far too much lately.</p><p>&quot;Pardon me Miss Rarity, but if you could please elaborate on one particular item on the list that I find confusing.&quot; She gave me a pleased smile before nodding. &quot;Where the hell am I suppose to find a bottle of liquid rainbow?&quot; Her smile faded in an instant.</p><p>&quot;You're not going to make this easy are you?&quot; she asked flatly.</p><p>&quot;I've no idea what you're talking about boss.&quot; Rarity just shook her head as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>&quot;You're most likely to get it from Rainbow Dash, she usually has some lying around. If not then you'll just have to ask her to get some and pick it up at a later date.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not exactly what I...forget about it.&quot; Whatever it was I'll find out when I get it. I headed towards the door and was just about to push through when I suddenly stopped and hesitated. I had just realized that this would be the first time I'd be out in town on my own, Rarity sensed my hesitation. </p><p>&quot;Rodney dear unless you take the initiative and make an effort to know everypony in town they'll never know who you are. In fact being cooped up inside and out of sight will only create more tension, eventually somepony will start spreading rumors and before you realize it there's a stigma placed upon you.&quot; She approached me from behind and nudged me forward with a hoof. &quot;Besides, what's the worst that could happen?&quot;</p><p><i>'Oh you bitch.'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Outside.....]</p></div><p><i>'Smile, wave, keep walking and repeat.'</i> I kept repeating my little mantra over and over again as I walked along the streets of Ponyville. As expected everywhere I looked ponies around me would pause and stare at me as I pass by, unfortunately they weren’t the same looks of curiosity or confusion that greeted me when I first arrived, though there were some here and there. Due to recent events they were more cautious and wary of me, some even ran away probably expecting me to blow someone up. Those that did stay, however, kept giving me disapproving looks and even a few scowls like I was the town's only troublemaker, which I guess was understandable but it still sucked. </p><p>I was too focused on not making a scene to pay any attention to where I was going, in fact I had yet to look at the list or even the map for my first stop. Worse, before I realized it my casual walk turned to a brisk pace and was just about ready to sprint from the tension. Had I not glanced in front of me in time I would have barreled over three ponies and a flower stand. Fortunately I was able to stop right in front of them, <i>unfortunately</i> I now found myself in an awkward situation with three mares about ready to faint in front of me. </p><p><i>'Don't scream don't scream don't scream don't scream don't scream don't scream-'</i></p><p>&quot;Hello.&quot;</p><p>&quot;........hi?&quot; It was more of a whimper than actual speech but hell, they’re not screaming. I noticed how each of the earth ponies had a different type of flower as marks on their flanks. The one in the middle has a rose for her mark, her coat was pale yellow and her mane and tail had two different shades of red. To her left stood a pony with three lilies flowers as her mark, with pink coat and two shades of amber for her mane and tail. The last one sat on her haunches with two daisies as her mark and had brighter pink coat than the one before, her mane and tail was a bright lime color. </p><p>The awkward tension built again as I stood there staring at them and vice versa, it went on until it was clear I had to be the one to break the silence. Although I'll never mention it to Rarity, I decided to lay it as thick as possible. &quot;Ladies, I was wondering if it would be possible for you to aid me.&quot; I bent my knees and lowered myself till I was roughly their height. &quot;I was tasked with retrieving several items for my employer, however she failed to mention where they are located.&quot; Even though I had a map I decided to pretend otherwise for the sake of it. &quot;I was given this list and I was hoping that one of you dazzling mares would be kind enough to point me in the right direction.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh god I think I'm gonna hurl.'</span></p><p>Ignoring the voice in my head, yes I realize how that sounds, I kept up a small gentle smile as I held the scroll and offered it to them. To my relief their expression and posture softened and their eyes now gazed at me more out of curiosity than fear and suspicion. &quot;But where are my manners, my name is Rodney. Equestria's one and only resident human. And you lovely ladies are?&quot;</p><p>The one with the green mane nudged the middle with a hoof causing the two to have a silent argument with each other, which lasted a few seconds, before she finally decided to speak. &quot;Uhm, my name's Rose Luck. This is Daisy,&quot; she pointed her hoof towards the green maned pony, &quot;...and this is Lily.&quot; She pointed to the last of the trio. Each mare tried to smile nervously as their names were called while I gave a nod to each. </p><p><i>'What is up with these ponies and their names.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'At least it makes it easier for us to remember them.'</span></p><p>&quot;Appropriate names befitting such fine mares.&quot; To be honest I was actually starting to enjoy this out of simple curiosity as to how far I could take it. &quot;Now back to the matter at hand, would you please kindly show me where I can find the nearest item on the list?&quot; Rose slowly leaned forward and taking the scroll with her front hoof, how she managed to do that is beyond me. By this point I've decided to simply go with the flow whenever these ponies decided to do something that goes beyond the realm of <i>shit-that-makes-sense</i>.</p><p>Rose unfurled the scroll and began reading it while occasionally glancing nervously at me, like she actually thought I was going to jump her or something while she wasn't looking. &quot;Uhm most of these stuff can be found along Trademares Street, just go down that street,&quot; she pointed down a street at my four-o'clock with her muzzle before continuing. &quot;...then take the second right and just keep going. Although I'm not sure if anypony sells any liquid rainbow.&quot; She lifted her hooves off the scroll and let it furl up again before handing (hoofing?) it back to me. I took it from her outstretched hoof and was just about to leave, but by now I was enjoying it a bit too much. </p><p>&quot;Thank you so much my dear for your assistance, however I can tell from your eyes, which are beautiful by the way, that you have something on your mind. Please feel free to question me what you wish, I have nothing to hide and I would like everyone to feel comfortable around me.&quot; There was some hesitation at first, but seeing that she was still alive after talking to me Rose once again was the first to ask. </p><p>&quot;So are you like, some kind of monkey?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Again with the monkey ques-I mean.&quot; I coughed a bit pretending to clear my throat. &quot;Yes my dear, scientifically you could say my kind are distant cousins to them. But I promise that we humans are far more sophisticated and never act like animals.&quot; <i>'mostly.'</i> &quot;Is that all?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're not going to hurt us?&quot; asked Daisy.</p><p>&quot;Perish the thought my dear! How could I ever harm anyone as lovely as you.&quot; To my surprise she actually started to blush. <i>'Damn I can't believe this shit is actually working!'</i></p><p>&quot;So you're not going to,&quot; Lily swallowed nervously before continuing. &quot;...eat us? Even though you have fangs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will not hide it, I do eat meat.&quot; They all tensed as the word 'meat' came out. &quot;But I would never eat a pony.&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">' Depends on how desperate we are.'</span> That did however gave me an idea, one that put a smile on my face. &quot;But I guess that all depends.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Wha-what do you mean, <i>depends?</i>&quot; asked Rose, she looked at me with renewed fear in her eyes while her ears fell flat.</p><p>I simply let a wide grin spread while slowly inching closer to her face causing her pupils to shrunk even more. &quot;Well, it all depends if a gorgeous mare like yourself or your friends would enjoy being <i>eaten.</i>&quot; I spoke in a deep, husky voice just above a whisper, emphasizing the last word in a sultry tone to ensure that all three got the message, but just in case they didn't I poked my tongue out and started to lip my lips loudly.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Three. Two. One.'</span> Right on cue their faces exploded with different shades of deep red and were now positively glowing, Rose even tucked her tail under her while Lily and Daisy squeezed their hind hooves closer on reflex. And I was just getting started, I started to approach them step by step which caused them to move backwards until they hit the flower stall behind them. </p><p>&quot;I was also told by a certain pony how much she liked my hands.&quot; I raised my right hand in front of them. &quot;She especially loved how soft and <i>flexible</i> my fingers are.&quot; While their attention was still locked on my hands I started to wriggle each finger about as if each were alive somehow. Whatever it was that went through their heads caused those shades of red to spread rapidly, making their entire heads glow bright. The best part was how Rose started to bite her lower lip. </p><p>Unfortunately I realized there must be some ponies around still keeping an eye on me, it was a bad idea to overly embarrass these three in public so before things escalated even further I decided to stop my antics there. &quot;Unfortunately, I am far too busy to satisfy such requests.&quot; I stood up and took a step back while brushing of dirt from my pants. With an exaggerated bow like that of a fairy tale prince and another thank you, I started walking away towards the street Rose pointed to before. Once I heard all three release a breath of relief I turned around and clicked my tongue to get their attention. As all three mares looked at me I silently mouthed the words &quot;call me&quot; along with a wink, making them blush all over again. Thanks to those three, I was in too good a mood to let the stares bother me anymore. I calmly made my way towards Trademares Street while still remembering to wave and smile. Only this time, the smile was genuine.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/452cd5c99eee0a0a614715db9a2d1ffad7e4991c?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc01.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2012%2F234%2Fe%2F3%2Fcustom_xbox_achievemt___3__by_noxxels-d5c1w5g.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several hours later....]</p></div><p>Everything else since then, however, had been both aggravating and tiring. Every time I walked into a store, the shopkeepers would go ballistic and try to kick me out, thinking I was going to burn down their shop or something. <i>'I guess news does travel fast in small towns like this.'</i> What would have probably only taken an hour or maybe two at most, took nearly five hours to finish. One particular unicorn who owned a jewelry shop actually started shooting magic at me on sight, didn't do crap of course but it still hurt my feelings. It nearly got dangerous when he suddenly got smart and decided to start chucking objects at me. Fortunately, since I absorbed a good amount of magic from his earlier onslaught, I was able to levitate each flying object safely to the floor. It was only when he started to get exhausted that he began to listen to reason, too bad he was a dick. He practically threw Rarity's order at me and didn't even apologize to me, and much as I’d like to punch the old bastard’s face in, I still had to watch how I act. Plus, he was one of Rarity's suppliers and I didn't want to cause anymore problems for her after all she's done.</p><p>By the time I got everything, except the bottle of liquid rainbow, it was already sunset. Since it wasn't a priority I decided to just call it a day and head back to Carousel Boutique. With a large bag on each hand while levitating three large bolts of cloth behind me, I started to make my way back, unfortunately due to the nature of my powers the bolts of cloth looked more like large torches. Some ponies thought I was unaware and started to yell or even ran up to me with buckets of water, luckily I was able to stop them before they were able to ruin them. Unfortunately there were a number of ponies who thought I was about to start burning houses down, each time I was able to successfully calm them down but they just kept coming one after another. After another thirty minutes of hollering and screaming I decided I had enough bullshit for one day. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Don’t do anything drastic, we're already on thin ice.'</span></p><p><i>'I don't care! I'm tired, I'm hungry and most of all I'm pissed! I just want the day to be over with.'</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'It'll only make things worse, for now just bite down and deal with it. It's not worth getting kicked out of town.'</span> After several deep, calming breaths I decided to heed <i>his</i> words. I carried both bags in my right hand while positioning the three bolts of cloth on top of my left shoulder, using my left hand to hold it in place before terminating the spell. After another lengthy argument with several ponies I was able to convince them to leave me be, with a grunt I carried all the items by manpower alone all the way to Carousel Boutique, each step causing my back to jolt in pain by the weight.</p><p><i>'I'm going to have to talk with Twilight about these townsfolk.'</i> After a grueling and painful march, I finally reached my destination. <i>'I may need to ask Rarity to dress these cuts again, pretty sure some of them are bleeding again.'</i> I pushed through the front door causing the bell above to chime pleasantly. </p><p>&quot;Rarity I'm-&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">&quot;SURPRISE!!&quot;</span></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/4fbb303ec76fa6d4208fd6015c96ecdf0dd081dd?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc07.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Fi%2F2012%2F079%2F3%2F0%2Fsmile_smile_smile_by_yanoda-d4r2lhj.png" /></p></div><p>Small pops exploded around me, spraying out party streamers all over me and what sounded like a an army of ponies started yelling and screaming their lungs out. Once my eyes adjusted to the sudden brightness I got a good look around the room, the ceiling was completely covered by balloons and there were party streamers everywhere I looked. Pinkie Pie stood in the middle of a clearing in front of me with outstretched hooves looking up at me with the widest grin I've ever seen.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/7b1e14d1be14967b28dac55fe4f119080d2d360f?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc01.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2011%2F330%2Fd%2F5%2Fpinkie_pie___smile_by_zobe-d4heiza.png" /></p></div><p>Behind her stood Twilight, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Rarity each wearing a party hat along with a large number of ponies I didn’t even recognize. Prominently hanging above everyone was a large banner that said:</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-size:1.5em">WELCOME TO PONYVILLE RODNEY</span></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-size:1.25em">PLEASE DON'T BURN IT DOWN</span></p></div><p>I was genuinely surprised really but I was too exhausted to show it, I just stood there staring at the scene in front of me looking absolutely miserable while drenched in sweat with the back of my shirt stained with blood. But despite all that Pinkie wasn't at all deterred, she just kept smiling that ridiculous smile along with with everyone else. Eventually it started to infect me and soon my lips started to curve up and before I knew it I had a smile across my face just as ridiculous as Pinkie's, at least as far as humanly possible.</p><p><i>'I guess these ponies aren't so bad after all.'</i></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: 	Sorry for the delay, got sick so had to take a break.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 19 - There's a troll I need to deal with<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>The party was...nice. It was eerily familiar with birthday parties back home, at first it felt awkward but soon enough I found myself enjoying the nostalgia, even if some of the games were a bit childish. Rarity however insisted that I freshen up first, using her magic to clean up most of the dirt and sweat while dressing up my back with fresh bandages. I came back to the party looking much more presentable and seeing how much more relaxed everyone suddenly became showed that I must have looked much worse before than I thought. </p><p>I was pleasantly surprised that most of the ponies that make up the bulk of the crowd were genuinely interested in meeting me, some were still a bit fearful, but that fact that they still kept an open mind after all I've done meant a lot. Mostly it was just getting to know their names and the usual greetings, it didn’t take long for some to question me about the two incidents. It did feel repetitive and tiring to explain and repeat myself over and over again, but I kept up with it. The more townsfolk that knew the truth, the more it'll spread. I hoped that soon enough everyone will hear of it and stop bugging me whenever I use my spells in public. </p><p>Twilight and her friends were also a great help, there were some that didn't have the nerve to talk to me directly so they would slowly introduce me to them while staying close to keep them comfortable. Applejack even introduced me to the rest her family, and wouldn't you know it they’re called the Apple family. Big Mac was, to pony standards, huge but to me he was only about a head taller than most ponies, resembling Luna’s height but much bulkier. He looked at me firmly and I could tell he was sizing me up, he's probably a family man and just trying to keep his family safe so I didn't mind. Unfortunately Applebloom wasn't around, apparently bedtimes exist in this world as well. I questioned Applejack if it was safe to leave a child, or a foal I guess, alone at home. She mentioned how another member of her family, an elderly mare named Granny Smith, was looking out for her.</p><p>I was grateful that Applejack came, more accurately because she brought several dishes with her, and of course they were made primarily out of apples. The apples were already amazing as it is but Applejack was just a gifted cook as Rarity, the apple pies were to die for. But most of all, they were the only other food source other than the many pastries that Pinkie baked for the party. Don't get me wrong they were amazing, but after eating a slice of the large cake in my honor I was convinced that these ponies were somehow immune to diabetes, it's the only explanation for Pinkie's continued existence. </p><p>For the rest of the party I spent most of my time either alone or around the six mare after introducing myself to everyone willing to meet me, it's best to let them come to their own conclusions. Twilight along with Spike was kind enough to bring along my stuff I left behind, including my little journal. The party went on till somewhere near midnight before ponies started leaving, the girls hung back to help clean up after the party. I struck up a conversation with Twilight trying to setup another town meeting to make a formal introduction to the town when Spike interrupted with a belch. I had expected Twilight to start berating him, but instead she just stood there and waited while a trail of smoke from Spike suddenly exploded in a bright flash leaving behind a scroll.</p><p>Seeing my dumbstruck expression, Twilight went on to explain how Spike's dragon fire can be used to deliver and receive letters from Celestia directly, much to the dragon's pride. &quot;Yup, since I was hatched by Twilight's magic my fire is different from normal dragons, pretty cool huh?&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'If by cool he means unhygienic and plain out gross, than yes.'</span></p><p>&quot;Not the word I'm looking for, but sure, why not.&quot; I turned to Twilight who was busy reading the letter, &quot;So what's it about? I'm guessing it's about me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Princess Celestia is asking how the town is faring ever since your arrival.&quot; Twilight started drawing circles on the floor nervously, &quot;I haven't really told her about the incident's yet.&quot; I cocked an eyebrow at her. &quot;Well I didn't want her to take you away after only spending several days in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because to you it felt like you failed her right?&quot; Twilight's head hung low while looking away from me.</p><p>&quot;Is it really that obvious?&quot; I chuckled and started to rub her head. </p><p>&quot;I'm actually flattered you would go about hiding it considering who she is to you.&quot; I brought back my hand so that she'd look at me. &quot;Which is why you <i>should</i> tell her, I'd never forgive myself if you got into trouble for my mistakes. As long as the town is still willing to have me, I doubt Celestia or Luna will do anything drastic.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I guess that makes sense, thank you Rodney.&quot; I shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;And I'll talk to the mayor about another town meeting tomorrow.&quot; I went back to work cleaning the floor with a broom while Twilight brought out a quill and parchment out of nowhere before writing a reply. Somehow the idea of Twilight constantly having a quill and parchment at hand, or hoof I guess, everywhere she goes isn't all that surprising. Several minutes later she rolled up the parchment and gave it to Spike before he puffed up and blew a stream of green fire which incinerated it. </p><p>&quot;I'm guessing that's how you reply back?&quot; I asked as I traced smoke as it flew out the window. </p><p>&quot;That's right, goes straight to the Princess.&quot; Spike replied with pride.</p><p>&quot;To her office or-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope, straight to Princess Celestia herself.&quot; He replied again. I scratched my chin as I pondered the many possibilities that presented until an idea hit me, I slowly turned back to look at Spike with a wide smile that showed my teeth. &quot;Whoa, dude that's creepy.&quot;</p><p>I simply started laughing as I made my way towards Twilight, &quot;Twilight do you have time to teach me how to make enchantments?&quot;</p><p>Twilight cocked a brow at me, &quot;I guess, it's not that different from making passive spells. But why the sudden interest?&quot;</p><p>With an innocent smile I replied, &quot;There's a troll I need to deal with.&quot; I laughed when Twilight looked even more confused. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[About thirty minutes later.....]</p></div><p>While most of the girls started to head back Twilight and Spike stayed behind a bit longer as I requested while Rarity headed upstairs to bed. Thankfully Twilight was right, enchantments are quite similar to passive spells. The only major difference is where, instead of working with my source of magic, I had to program the spell to work off an entirely different and independent source, in this case the parchment itself. The hardest part was actually learning to 'inject' magic to the parchment, something Twilight had intended to teach me on future sessions as part of my training. 'Injecting' magic is basically as it sounds, pouring in raw magic to fuse with an inanimate object. In my case however, the parchment kept burning up due to the nature of my magic if I put too much. If I put in too little, it dissipates before I could apply the enchantment. Since the parchment was made out of plants it could hold a decent amount of magic, just enough for what I have in mind. </p><p>Unfortunately, even though Twilight was starting to enjoy teaching and training me again, it was really starting to get late and Spike could barely keep his eyes open. So I decided to let Twilight inject the magic into the parchment while I programmed the spell. There was no real way to know if the spell would work considering it's just a prototype, but even if it doesn't work Celestia will only receive a blank scroll and I can just try again. </p><p>&quot;You promise this won't hurt her?&quot; Twilight asked again for the umpteenth time. </p><p>&quot;Twily, I promise that whatever I'm doing will not in any way harm Celestia. It's just a little light show as thanks for all she's done. Think of it like fireworks,&quot; Twilight's eyes widened, &quot;...<i>without</i> the explosions. Trust me Twilight, Celestia knows this is coming for her, and it's been long overdue.&quot; With a sigh Twilight finally relented and started to inject some of her magic into the rolled up parchment in front of her.</p><p>&quot;Now remember since it's made of plants it can hold a bit more magic than most materials however its been processed it won't be able to hold it for long, I estimate fifteen seconds before it starts to dissipate. But-&quot;</p><p>&quot;But during travel it's under a completely different spell so the magic should be suspended until it forms back into a scroll at Celestia's side. Yes Twilight I get it, it should be enough time for Celestia to open the scroll.&quot; </p><p>Twilight huffed irritably before sending the scroll to float in front of me, &quot;Now make sure you don't touch it otherwise-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes yes Twily I know can we please move on?&quot; Twilight let out a sigh of defeat.</p><p>&quot;Very well, ready?&quot; I picked up the sleeping dragon of the floor and held him before giving Twilight a nod. Twilight's horn glowed brighter and slowly the floating scroll started to glow just as bright, after about a minute Twilight shouted, &quot;Now!&quot;</p><p>I reached out with my mind towards the scroll and applied my spell on it causing it to spontaneously burst into blue fire as the spell took hold. &quot;Spike wake up!&quot; I gently shook the dragon but he only curled up on my arm and continued snoring. &quot;Sorry Spike, but revenge is more important than you beauty sleep right now.&quot;</p><p>Twilight's ears perked up and she shot me a glare, &quot;Revenge!? Rodney what are you-&quot; but before she could say another word I positioned Spike's snout in front of the scroll and I yanked his tail. </p><p>With a yelp of surprise a small burst of green emerald flame erupted from his mouth incinerating the scroll, &quot;What the hay!?&quot; Spike was glaring up at me with anger, I made a quick apology while keeping my eye on the trail of smoke as it flew out the window.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Canterlot Castle, about a minute earlier....]</p></div><p>&quot;...and it is written here that he magically lifted an entire building on his own!&quot; Luna was pacing back and forth nervously in front of Celestia inside her chamber. &quot;Sister mayhaps we were too hasty? Perhaps we should reconsider retrieving him, clearly he has yet to master his abilities.&quot; </p><p>Unlike Luna, Celestia was seated nearby sipping tea and remaining calm. As ruler Celestia realized long ago that anxiety would do nothing to fix any problem, &quot;Please calm down Lulu, you and I both know that something like this was liable to happen, although I admit I myself did not expect Rodney to cause so much trouble so quickly.&quot; Celestia sipped her tea again before continuing, &quot;Nevertheless Twilight remains confident he is safe enough to continue, by her words both incidents were caused by lack of foresight on both parties and nopony was injured. Besides now we have clear evident proof that the band is working as it should and he remains unaware of it, so it's not all bad.&quot;</p><p>Luna trotted towards the table and sat in front of Celestia, &quot;That is also something we are uncomfortable with, we do not hold much love for Rodney, but we do not enjoy causing him so much pain. Is there no other way Tia?&quot;</p><p>Celestia let out a sigh while placing her tea on the table, &quot;I don't take pleasure in it either but the nature of his powers prevent any other alternative, I want to believe he's harmless but I cannot risk it. Not until I have absolute proof that he is not a threat to Equestria. I hope he is ever an ally, personally I find his company to be enjoyable. The castle has been far too boring ever since he left, I almost miss-&quot; Suddenly both alicorns noticed another trail of smoke flying in from the window towards them and gathering in front of Celestia. With a flash a scroll appeared in front of both alicorns and before gravity could take over Celestia had already wrapped it around her spell. </p><p>&quot;Another one?&quot; Luna asked nervously, &quot;Did Rodney cause another incident already?&quot; Luna continued looking nervously at Celestia as she started unfurling the scroll. &quot;What does it-&quot; suddenly the scroll was enveloped in a familiar azure flame, &quot;Is that not-&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">BOOOOOOOOM!!</span></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a class="embed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg</a></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Go to 11:55 for visual help)</p></div><p>&quot;TIA!&quot; Luna was about to leap over the table to inspect and hopefully heal whatever injury her sister had suffered, but once the lights disappeared she fell back on her haunches completely dumbstruck. The door exploded inwards as both dayguards and nightguards started filling the room. </p><p>One of the guards that came in first stepped forward, &quot;Princess Luna we heard some-something.....&quot; but as he followed her gaze he too fell silent with mouths agape much like Luna's along with the rest of the guards. Seated across the Princess of the Night, Celestia was wide eyed with a look of absolute confusion with her beautiful mane completely blown back and stood frozen on ends. </p><p>&quot;Pfft..............BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!&quot; Luna fell to the floor on her back laughing her head off with her hooves dangling upwards. Slowly the laughter started to infect the guards and one by one they started to join, first it started with snickers but before long it was full blown laughter. With great effort Luna brought herself back upright and turned towards Celestia, &quot;Per-perhaps thou are correct dear s-sister phfft, his company would bring us great enjoyment.&quot; Celestia turned to look at Luna with a glare but it only sent her into another laughing fit. </p><p>&quot;This is not over monkey.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/bfea9b9d164c8baf7d8f35827d6102256fccb66a?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc06.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2012%2F236%2F7%2Ff%2Fcustom_xbox_achievement___4__by_noxxels-d5cb19u.jpg" /></p></div><p>AN:	Well this was fun to write, I had this idea stashed away ever since I saw that video. Unfortunately I couldn't find a picture with Celestia having her mane blown back, just imagine those old cartoons from back in the day. </p><p>Also thumbs up for Rodney getting two achivements in a row. Credit for the pic goes to Noxxels.</p><p>I'm improving, still sick but definitely feeling better, kinda suck that Pinkie won't be wearing that outfit for long. </p><p><span style="color:#FFC0CB">Don't worry I've got tons more laying around in case of costume emergencies.</span></p><p>See now I just have to know.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 20 - It appears you have quite a knack with children<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><p>AN: Massive delay incoming, details below.</p><hr/><p>If the sudden explosion of rainbows of in the distance was any indication, I'd say my little trick did it's job, much to Twilight's dismay. The two of us spent the next thirty minutes bickering outside of Carousel Boutique, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'actually it was just Twilight screaming at us.'</span> And it would have gone further on into the night if Rarity hadn't stuck her head out the window and convinced Twilight to go home, <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'actually it was just Rarity threatening to cut Twilight's mane if she didn't stop screaming and go home.'</span></p><p>So after ensuring that no harm was done with another torrent of apologies to Twilight, and one to Spike for yanking his tail, we parted ways. Thankfully while I was away on Rarity's errand she actually found time to do a bit more clean up on the second floor, meaning that for tonight I actually get to sleep on a real bed. Unfortunately said bed was not made to human specification, in fact the way the room was decorated and furnished I swear a pony lived here at one time or another. But seeing as Twilight and I had bothered her far too much already I decided to ask her another time and tried to make the best of it. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[The next day....]</p></div><p>&quot;ZzzzZZzzz....&quot;</p><p>&quot;.....&quot;</p><p>&quot;zzZZzzz....&quot;</p><p>&quot;....&quot;</p><p>&quot;ZzzZzzz-&quot;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!&quot;</span>	</p><p>&quot;GAH my ears!&quot; I shot up from the bed clutching my ears while grinding my teeth in pain as what could only be described as nail on blackboard sound continued ripping through my eardrums. I only caught a glance of a filly standing by the door screaming her head off before dashing away. </p><p>&quot;Rarity! There's a monkey sleeping in my bed!!&quot; I continue to gaze at the open door dumbstruck for several seconds before pinching the bridge of my nose and letting out a frustrated sigh. </p><p>I continue to mumbled several more lines of curses before falling back to the tiny bed only to curse loudly in pain and springing back up, &quot;It's way too early for shit like this.&quot; Realizing it was impossible to go back to sleep, I got up and made my way towards the bathroom, <i>'I get the feeling this is gonna be a loooong day.'</i></p><p>After a quick freshen up I headed downstairs to find Rarity already busy in the kitchen making breakfast for us. I was about to greet her when a pair of large eyes caught my attention from under the dining table. &quot;Ah good morning Rodney, I see you've met Sweetie Belle.&quot; Said Rarity while still busy cooking what looked like an omelette. </p><p>&quot;You could say that.&quot; I replied while rubbing the inside of my right ear with a finger. &quot;So, Sweetie Belle is it?&quot; Now that I had a good look, and not paralyzed by pain, I noticed she was a unicorn and roughly the same size as Applebloom which probably makes her somewhat the same age. She has extremely light gray coat, almost near white, with a shade of purple and pink as her mane and tail. Like Applebloom she too lacked a mark on her flank. </p><p>Once it was clear that I was giving her my full attention she bolted straight towards Rarity and hid under her while grasping one of her hooves which caused Rarity to stumble a bit. &quot;Now Sweetie Belle, how many times must I keep mentioning how dangerous that is? Especially while I'm cooking.&quot; After placing the hot pan down and getting the omelette on a plate she bent her head down and used her muzzle to push the little filly out from under her towards me. Sweetie Belle fell on her haunches and planted her hooves hard on the floor to stop, however the floor was far too slippery for any traction so she just continued sliding closer to me. &quot;Now be polite and introduce yourself.&quot; Said Rarity in a pleasant tone before turning around and tending to the kitchen again.</p><p>Despite Rarity's encouragement Sweetie Belle just sat there staring up at me with her ears fallen back and eyes the size of apple seeds, clearly she was too afraid to say or do anything. Fortunately I've handled children before as a part time job when I was desperate so I've picked up a nifty trick to get children to approach me easier, and considering how small this town was there's a fairly good chance my plan would work. I looked away from the filly and made my way to sit at one of the chairs around the dining table though, just like in the castle, I still had to sit crossed legged considering how low it is. I rested my head on my right arm looking as nonchalant as possible while looking at another direction but keeping her near the edge of my vision, I activated both my 'Sense' and 'Sight' before I started speaking again.  </p><p>&quot;You know, you remind me of Applebloom.&quot; Almost immediately I could see the change in the way her 'fire' burned, where it was once flickering nervously now it was burning with a bit more strength to it.</p><p>&quot;You know Applebloom?&quot; <i>'Just as I thought, they know each other. Time for the final push.'</i></p><p>&quot;Yes I do, Applejack's little sister, she wears a big red bow on top of her head. I gotta tell ya, she was a lot more friendly and less of a chicken than you when I first met her.&quot; Just like before her 'fire' suddenly intensified as her fear and suspicion were now replaced with anger.</p><p>&quot;I'm not a Scoota-er chicken! Take that back!&quot; With a smile I turned and looked at her with my full attention, only this time she didn't shy away and instead kept on glaring at me. </p><p>&quot;Hmmm I don't know, I still think Applebloom is friendlier.&quot; I teased.</p><p>&quot;Hey I can be just as friendly as Applebloom!&quot; She defended.</p><p>&quot;Prove it.&quot; I said with a grin before sticking my hand out towards her. &quot;Rodney.&quot;</p><p>Immediately and with determination she shoved her right hoof into my open hand and started shaking it, &quot;Sweetie Belle.&quot; she replied with a smile of her own. We continue to shake each other's limbs for several seconds before her eyes suddenly widened in realization. My smile spread wider as she looked at me, down to her hooves in my grasp and back up to me, &quot;Oh, you're good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My my Rodney it appears you have quite a knack with children.&quot; Rarity trotted over towards the dining table along with three plates of omelettes behind her. </p><p>&quot;It's nothing to brag about, just something I picked up when I was working part time as a caretaker.&quot; I replied while grabbing one of the plates as it drifted towards me. &quot;So, Rarity Belle and Sweetie Belle, sisters then?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;Yes that is correct, my parents must have just dropped her off again. Forgive me for not telling you about her earlier I was too preoccupied with my orders and setting up the party that-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It slipped your mind, I get it. Don't worry about it boss.&quot; I replied before stuffing my face of the golden omelette in front of me.</p><p>&quot;You know it's impolite to cut it off somepony like that.&quot; she scolded.</p><p>&quot;Shorrie uhmout-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahem.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Sorry about that, old habits die hard I guess.&quot; Rarity merely glared at me before she too started eating. </p><p>&quot;How come he called you 'boss'?&quot; asked Sweetie Belle. </p><p>&quot;Simple, cause I work for her.&quot; The rest of the conversation was mostly just Rarity and me explaining my current living situation and even told her about the incident regarding the building, though I dumbed it down a bit. Why frighten her with details. </p><p>&quot;I thought the house looked different! Mom and Dad told me it was just my imagination.&quot; She shouted to Rarity all the while keeping close and beaming up to her. Clearly Sweetie Belle had great affection and looks up to Rarity, albeit a bit too much perhaps. </p><p>&quot;So what's on my job list for today boss?&quot; I asked after placing the last dish away to dry. </p><p>&quot;Only the usual clean up and store prep, but other than that you're free to do whatever you wish for the rest of the day. It will do you some good to let those injuries heal a bit.&quot; Rarity levitated one of her glasses towards her along with several tools like scissors and needles before trotting off towards her work station. &quot;I, on the other hoof, will be busy all day as usual fulfilling orders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ooooh can I help?&quot; Sweetie Belle squealed as she bounced up and down around the room, knocking down several items and even a ponyquine off balance, luckily Rarity caught every single one with her spell. </p><p>&quot;Actually Rodney there is something...&quot; <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Saw that one coming.'</span> </p><p>Before Rarity could continue, &quot;Got it. Hey Sweetie Belle, how's about you help me clean up a bit? After that you could show me around town, I haven't had a proper tour of the town ever since I got here.&quot; </p><p>Sweetie Belle scratched her chin while gazing upwards as she contemplated my offer, &quot;I don't know, Rarity might need my help to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's quite alright darling I'll manage, you go ahead with Rodney.&quot; Although she tried to hide it I still noticed how the words came out a bit too fast, luckily Sweetie Belle didn't seem to notice. </p><p>&quot;Well there you have it, c'mon, we'll do some quick clean up then you can show me all the cool places in town.&quot; An idea popped into my head. &quot;If we have time maybe we can ask Applebloom to come with us, whatta ya say to that?&quot; I asked while walking towards the front of the store with Sweetie Belle trotting up to follow.</p><p>&quot;Oh oh, can we get Scootaloo to come too? That way the Cutie Mark Crusaders can give you the tour.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Who and what now?&quot; I asked with a cocked eyebrow.</p><p>&quot;Oh I guess you haven't met Scootaloo yet, well she's a orange pegasus and together with Applebloom we're,&quot; Sweetie Belle raised a hoof in pride, &quot;<span style="font-size:1.5em">the Cutie-Mark Crusaders!</span>&quot;</p><p>&quot;AH my ears!&quot; I clutched both ears and gritted my teeth against Sweetie Belle's high pitch scream. Sweetie Belle’s ears fell while curling up in fear at my sudden outburst. &quot;Sorry Sweets I didn't mean to shout like that,&quot; I apologized, &quot;...it's just that I'm particularly sensitive to high pitch noises. I don't mind you screaming but just watch that pitch for me ok?&quot;</p><p>Slowly my words calmed her brought her back to her cheery self, &quot;Oh, uhm, I guess I'm sorry too then, I didn't know monkeys have sensitive ears like that.&quot;</p><p>I let out a frustrated sigh, &quot;I am not a monkey Sweets, I'm a human.&quot; <i>'Why do I get the feeling this is something I’m going to have to put up with for a LONG time.'</i> &quot;Anyways let's get to it shall we?&quot;</p><p>But before either of us could begin cleaning up I heard Rarity shouting from behind the store, &quot;Rodney! Could I speak with you for a moment?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Why don't you get started a bit while I see your sister.&quot; With an adorable salute from Sweetie Belle I turned around and headed back to Rarity, &quot;Yea boss?&quot; Once I entered the back room Rarity dropped all the tools that were floating around her and looked at me with a serious demeanor.</p><p>&quot;Now Rodney I hope you understand that this is not some simple grocery job you're undertaking, this is my sister I'm trusting you with. <i>Family</i>.&quot; Her eyes were hard and I could sense a bit of threat when she emphasized the words 'family', and understandably so. </p><p>&quot;Rarity I promise, no matter what happen Sweetie Belle's safety, as well as any other under my care, is my priority above all else.&quot; I looked into her eyes as I said these words without falter.</p><p>&quot;Hmm, I may not be Applejack but I can still tell you're serious.&quot; She kept her gaze on me for a while before giving an nod. &quot;Very well I'll take your word for it then, just...please be careful dear.&quot;</p><p>I decided to butter up a bit and maybe ease the tension, &quot;Fret not my dear Rarity,&quot; I spoke in a prince-like manner along with a sweeping bow causing her to smile and giggle a bit, &quot;...I got this.&quot; and just like that her smile disappeared. </p><p>&quot;Why must you raise my hopes up only to crush it a moment later?&quot; she asked flatly. &quot;It’s as if you enjoy it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about boss.&quot; I answered with a mischievous smile.</p><p>Rarity just rolled her eyes at me, &quot;Moving on.&quot; Her horn glowed as she levitated a small pouch from a nearby table towards me. &quot;Here are some bits for you and Sweetie Belle in case you get hungry, there should be enough for the rest of the crusaders as well.&quot; I grabbed the pouch which jingled a bit.</p><p>Just then a loud clamor came from the front of the store. &quot;I think that's my cue.&quot; I gave her another reassuring smile before heading towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p>&quot;Rodney if even a hair of her mane is injured I'm cutting your salary! Do you hear me?&quot; I chuckled at Rarity's threat and made my way to the front of the store. </p><p><i>'Wait a minute, I have a salary!?'</i></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN:	Yes I know it's another short chapter, I could add a bit more but I like the ending as it is. But there's another reason behind it, no it's not because I'm playing Guild Wars 2 (at least not entirely), it's cause I gotta prepare to pack and ship all my stuff back to the US. Packing, flying and then unpacking will probably set the next chapter a week late or so. </p><p>But at the least I'm all better now, no thanks to Pinkie.</p><p><span style="color:#FFC0CB">Hey I gave motivational support!</span></p><p>But then you hammered my head in!

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 21 - Is that what I look like when I do it?<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><p>AN: I'm ba~ack!</p><hr/><p>&quot;Uhm you know what, let's just skip the cleaning part for today and just head on out for that tour.&quot; I looked around the store, or at least it once looked like a store. The floor was littered with torn up fabric and tables turned over spilling their whatever items sat atop them. &quot;Yup, definitely going out.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I would have thought such blatant acts of chaos and destruction HAD to be done on purpose to cause this much damage, but this kid? I swear she was born when the planets were aligned or something.'</span></p><p>Sweetie Belle's head hung low, &quot;I'm sorry, I was just trying to help.&quot; She mumbled while tracing circles on the floor. For every bit of progress I made cleaning and prepping the store, Sweetie Belle undid the next second later by some elaborate domino effect.</p><p>I let out a sigh, &quot;It's ok Sweetie I'm not angry or anything.&quot; <i>'Irritated maybe, cleaning this up will take all night.'</i> Seeing how the filly was still depressed I kneeled down in front of her and started rubbing her head gently. &quot;Don't worry I'm not upset, like you said you were only trying to help, they were just accidents.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Still have my doubts you can call'em accidents.'</span></p><p>Sweetie Belle giggled as I messed her mane about, &quot;That tickles!&quot; She squirmed her way out from under my reach looking much brighter than before.</p><p>&quot;Better?&quot; I asked with a grin.</p><p>She nodded whilst still giggling, &quot;Uhuh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well come on then, you're the guide. Show me what Ponyville can offer.&quot; I held a hand towards the door allowing Sweetie Belle to lead on.</p><p>But just as we were about to open the front door Rarity decided to check up on us, &quot;So how is everypony-WAHAHAA!&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a class="embed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KJLQ2sgcqs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KJLQ2sgcqs</a></p></div><p>&quot;Time to move.&quot; Before Rarity could recover from her shock I picked Sweetie Bell up cradling her under one arm and ran out the front door. &quot;Don't worry Rares we'll be back by dinner!&quot; I could practically <i>feel</i> Rarity seething with frustration behind me. Her screams started to diminish the more distance I put between us all the while Sweetie Belle just giggled under my arm.</p><p>I kept pumping my legs for the next minute or so before I started running out of breath. I may not have neglected physical fitness in my life but neither am I what you can consider strong or fit, all I did was the occasional jog around the neighborhood. I placed Sweetie Belle back gently on the ground before taking a moment to catch my breath.</p><p>&quot;That was fun! Can we do that again?&quot; Sweetie Belle was beaming up at me with a childish smile. &quot;It kinda felt like I was flying, though a bit bumpy.&quot; Suddenly it looked like she was trying to hold something down. &quot;Actually...never mind.&quot; I chuckled as she tried to suppress another urge to throw up.</p><p>&quot;Sorry about that, you ok?&quot; She nodded. It was only after catching my breath did I notice the ponies around us looking somewhat suspiciously at me.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Well they did just see an alien running out of a house carrying a child. Better do something quick before some idiot decides to make the situation worse.'</span></p><p><i>'That's easy.'</i> I bent over Sweetie Belle and picked her up with both hands on each side. &quot;Here Sweets, this should be a much smoother ride.&quot; She weighs a bit heavier than she looked so it took some effort but I was still able to safely lift her over my head and tuck her on top of my shoulders. My injuries stung me a bit when I lifted her off but once I set her down the pain eased off until it was just nothing more than a discomfort. Her hind hooves tightened around my neck as it dangled over my shoulders while her fore hooves wrapped around the side of my head. &quot;You ok there Sweets?&quot; I could feel her trembling a bit, &quot;Sweetie Be-WHOA!&quot;</p><p>She suddenly jerked up and actually climbed to stand on my shoulders with her front hooves on top of my head, &quot;Oh my gosh this is so cool!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Easy there Sweets I don't want you falling off, Rarity will kill me if anything happens to you.&quot; Luckily I was fast enough to compensate for the sudden shift in balance, though she did accidentally nudge my back causing me to hiss in pain. &quot;Now calm down and just settle back down like before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aaawww.&quot; Although I couldn't see her I was positive she was pouting with puppy dog eyes. I guess it didn't occur to her that she was beyond my vision which, considering how adorable she is, was probably a good thing.</p><p>Seeing as I didn't relent, Sweetie Belle slowly slid down and sat behind my neck like before. &quot;So, where to miss tour guide?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To Sweet Apple Acres! I can't wait to show see the look on Applebloom's face when she sees me riding you like this.&quot; I laughed at the irony of it.</p><p>&quot;Aye aye cap'tn!&quot; I shouted in a pirate accent causing her to laugh. It took me a few steps to realize something, &quot;Uh Sweets, you're gonna have to show me where it is. Kinda forgot my map back in the house and I don't want to go back on account that your sister scares me.&quot; My jibe at Rarity caused her to laugh again before pointing down a street on my left with one of her front hooves.</p><p>Seeing as Sweetie Belle was clearly having the time of her life everybody eventually started moving along and getting back to their daily chores. There were certainly a number of ponies still staring at me simply because I'm still a bit of a mystery, but those were simply out of curiosity so I didn't really mind. In fact most of them stared at me simply because I was an oddity, the ones with any sense of contempt were few and far between.</p><p><i>'I guess that party really did help out. Remind me to thank the girls for that.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Even the pink one?'</span></p><p><i>'Her especially, give credit where it's due.'</i></p><p>I continued to make my way to Sweet Apple Acres with Sweetie Belle showing me the way. It took a while and soon enough exhaustion was creeping back in, Sweetie Belle was already starting to feel heavy. Still I couldn't find it in me to spoil her fun and I needed the exercise anyways. Sweetie Belle took on the role of tour guide to heart and kept pointing to different stores and buildings informing me what each of them did or who lived there. Although, since she was just a child, most of her knowledge of the town revolved around places children would normally enjoy, like Sugarcube Corner or the local toy shop.</p><p>Eventually we we made our way beyond Ponyville's perimeter as the street became a bit more rugged with more dirt than stone, soon enough it was just dirt. It didn’t take long before I started walking by a white picket fence indicating we were already by the Apple family's property. By the time the large entryway to the farm came into view I was already sweating from both the heat of the sun and the trip. Since Sweetie Belle was both a living being and covered in fur it felt like I was wearing a winter scarf with its own heating system, I was already starting to get a bit light headed.</p><p>&quot;Hey Sweetie Belle, is it ok if I let you down from there?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;Do I have to? We're really close and I really, really want to show this to Applebloom.&quot; Much as I tried, I couldn't bring myself to argue with that adorable voice.</p><p>&quot;Alright, but after that you're gonna have to walk on your own again.&quot; <i>'Otherwise I might just pass out.'</i> To my relief I spotted Applejack only a minute later pulling a large wooden cart filled with empty buckets towards the apple trees with Applebloom trotting along beside her. None of them seemed to have noticed us yet.</p><p>&quot;App-mmph&quot; Sweetie Belle suddenly lurched forward and covered my mouth with a hoof. </p><p>&quot;Hang on a minute, I got an idea.&quot; I looked up to see Sweetie Belle smiling mischievously down at me.</p><p><i>'My god is that what I look like when I do it?'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Some minutes later, in the apple orchards...]</p></div><p>Although Applebloom was too young to start apple bucking like her sister, she was still determined to help around the farm as much as she could. Leaving the hard work to her able-bodied sister, Applebloom did her best to place the buckets under the apple trees and pick up any strays that missed. The sisters continued to work around the orchard while keeping up conversations. Naturally the conversation constantly veered towards Applebloom's lack of cutie-mark.</p><p>&quot;C'mon sis gimme another chance!&quot; Applebloom begged using her weapon grade puppy dog eyes.</p><p>&quot;Ah said no and that's final, and stop looking at me all cute like that. It don't work on me no more.&quot; Those eyes have conquered many ponies before, fortunately Applejack had built up an immunity to it over the years ever since Applebloom discovered she could abuse it. &quot;Ah don't mind yah tagging along with me to the market but yah ain't selling nothing to nopony no more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's called aggressive salesponyship.&quot; Applebloom argued.</p><p>&quot;Now don't start using fancy words to muddle the issued.&quot; Applejack loved her sister and especially her enthusiasm, but sometimes it's too much even for a tough mare like her. &quot;Now you get back to work now, those apples ain't getting into them barrels by themselves.&quot;</p><p>Applebloom took out her frustration on a small pebble kicking it a fair distance away, &quot;This ain't over AJ!&quot; With that Applebloom trotted away towards one particular apple that had rolled away.</p><p>&quot;Don't ah know it.&quot; Applejack mumbled under her breath.</p><p>Applebloom let out a sigh as the apple she was chasing had rolled down the hill and was now resting a fair distance away in a pile of dead leaves from last fall. She was tempted to just leave it there but fought the urge, it simply wasn't the Apple family way. She trotted down the hill being careful not to slip and tumble down and eventually stood over the runaway apple.</p><p>&quot;C'mere yah little rascal.&quot; Applebloom's head hung low and was about to bite down on the apple but stopped when she heard leaves rustling nearby. Her head shot back up with her ears standing at attention, she stood still gazing around her and trying to spot anything out of place. She shifted her ears to face various directions trying to focus and catch the slightest noise, but all she could hear was the shifting of tree branches around her and Applejack's grunt in the distance as she continued to harvest the apples.</p><p>&quot;Just the wind ah reckon.&quot; With a shrug Applebloom once again bent her head over the apple, only to hear dried leaves breaking again only now it was much louder and closer. This time Applebloom jumped in fright and spun around with her eyes darting about frantically, &quot;Big Mac? AJ? Winona? That you?&quot; Nothing. Much as she tried to see and hear there was nothing and nopony anywhere nearby.</p><p>&quot;Ah know sompony's here! Show yerself! Ah-ah can scream real loud!&quot; Applebloom tried to put on a brave front but her voice trembled in fear. She knew she had strayed too far from Applejack and even if she screamed it would still take some time for anypony to reach her.</p><p>Suddenly she heard movement from behind causing her to jump and face the source out of reflex. Her eyes darted about trying to find whoever or whatever made the noise, instead all she saw was a rock rolling on the dead leaves.</p><p>Her first thought was relief, <i>'Thank Celestia it's just a rock.'</i></p><p>Then confusion, <i>'Hang on a minute, rocks don't move or fly by themselves.'</i></p><p>Followed by realization, <i>'That's cause somepony threw it.'</i></p><p>And finally fear, <i>'Somepony threw it!'</i> Unfortunately by then it was too late, before Applebloom could do anything her vision suddenly darkened as something large and tall cast its shadow over her.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/567d7f395dad7cf4076fe0327e4a45762c0ca16d?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm7.staticflickr.com%2F6107%2F6347396378_1baeee5c20_z.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Best I could find.)</p></div><p>Due to Applebloom's short stature it was difficult for her to notice how similar the shadow looked to a certain human she’d met. So far the creature just stood there behind her doing nothing, Applebloom froze in fear thinking that if she did anything so too will the creature.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">&quot;APpLeblOOooOm&quot;</span> Applebloom jerked hard trying to suppress the urge to simply run away putting as much distance from the creature as possible. Its voice chilled her to the bone, it sounded so alien as if two voices were talking at the same time, one deep the other a much higher pitch.</p><p>She couldn't take it anymore, the tension was starting to suffocate her, slowly she shifted her body and turned to look behind her. Her ears fell flat against her head and her pupils shrunk to pinpricks as she slowly started lifting her chin to gaze upwards at the creature. It was completely covered in brown dried up leaves with vines and bits of bark underneath making it look like it was created purely out of the dead remains of plants and trees. To Applebloom the creature stood much like how Rodney would and it even had arms like he did. But the head, if it was the head, was much thicker and taller. Most of all it had what looked like two smaller limbs sticking out from the side.</p><p>Applebloom's heart skipped a beat as the creature suddenly bent over towards her. The thought of being this creature's next meal jolted her body into high gear with a single thought dominating her mind.</p><p><i>'Run.'</i></p><p>Applebloom turned and bolted away kicking off dust and leaves towards the creature causing it to cough and wave its limbs about. When the dust finally cleared off Applebloom was already up the hill and running towards the farmhouse, soon only her big red bow was the only thing the creature could see. The creature's skin started peeling off and falling to the earth revealing a dirt covered human with a unicorn filly riding on top its shoulder. The human lifted the unicorn off its shoulder and placed her on the ground before unwrapping the chains around his arms and dusting himself off.</p><p>&quot;Man that filly can run. You ok there Sweets?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think we went a teensy bit overboard, Applejack's going to be angry we scared her like that,&quot; replied the filly.</p><p>&quot;So will Rarity once she sees you covered with dirt and mud like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...I should go apologize huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You and I both. But it was totally worth it right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh most definitely.&quot; </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[About forty minutes later, just outside the farmhouse....]</p></div><p>&quot;Ah oughta hog tie and buck yeh all the way to Appleloosa for what yeh did!&quot; Applejack was pacing back and forth glaring at us, well at me mostly. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Actually it’s just us.'</span></p><p>&quot;Applejack I'm sorry, I really am. I'll admit the prank got a little overboard but-&quot;</p><p>&quot;A <i>little</i>? It took me fifteen whole minutes just to convince her to come out of her bed!&quot; I looked down at Applebloom who was sitting on her haunches next to Big Mac still shaking a bit from the adrenaline. Although Big Mac didn't talk much I could tell he was even more upset than Applejack. I kept imagining those giant hooves of his flatting me to a pulp and he had enough muscle to do it too.</p><p>I kneeled down and looked straight at Applebloom, &quot;Look I'm really sorry for what I did, honest. And please don't be angry at Sweetie Belle, it was all entirely <i>my</i> idea.&quot; Sweetie Belle was about to interject but luckily I was quick enough to rub her head and stop her. I had decided to take the full blame and pretend Sweetie Belle was simply tagging along for the ride, it all started out as an innocent prank and I didn't think she needed to get blamed for that. From the looks of it she still learned her lesson, even more so since someone else is taking the blame.</p><p>&quot;Sweetie Belle just wanted to you to come with her and help give me a tour of the town,&quot; I continue to explain. &quot;She mentioned something about going crusading and-&quot; instantly out of nowhere Applebloom's demeanor shifted a hundred-eighty degrees.</p><p>&quot;Yah mean ah get to go crusadin!? Are we going to pick up Scootaloo too?&quot; I was caught a bit off guard when she started jumping up and down. &quot;Maybe we can get our cutie-marks as tour guides!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That what I said!&quot; Whatever hit Applebloom had spread to Sweetie Belle because she too suddenly got all excited, the two started talking and shouting gleefully with each other as if nothing happen. Fortunately the sight of the two smiling fillies instantly killed any and all tension in the air, that had probably saved me wrong a whole heap of trouble.</p><p>&quot;Ah guess since nopony was hurt ah can let yeh off the hook. But I better not catch yah scaring the apple outta mah mah family like that again yah hear!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot;</p><p>Applebloom trotted to Applejack's side and gaze pleadingly to her, &quot;So can ah go then? Please?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah don't know Applebloom....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let her come along Applejack, after what I put her through she deserves some fun to balance things out. Plus it gives me a chance to make it up to her.&quot; Applejack looked at me as if I had gone crazy. &quot;Applejack I swear on my life I'll look after them like my own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah still don't think it's a good-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll spend half of my next payday from Rarity entirely on your apples.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Deal.&quot;</p><p>Applejack was kind enough to let us use a nearby well to clean and freshen up, I couldn't do much with my clothes but I was able to help get rid of most of the earth out of Sweetie Bell. Applejack also packed us a few slices of her amazing apple pies before finally making our way back towards Ponyville. To my misfortune Applebloom also wanted to ride on my shoulders much like Sweetie Belle did. And after what I put her through I can't rightly say no now can I? So for the rest of the journey back to Ponyville I was Applebloom’s personal human taxi.</p><p>&quot;So ladies, where to now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let's go find Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo is always following her around.&quot; answered Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;And does anyone know where to find Rainbow Dash?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm ah reckon she's by the lake, she spends most of her time practicing fancy flying moves all day.&quot; replied the filly on top of me.</p><p>&quot;Well then, onward to the lake! With haste!&quot;</p><br/><br/><p>[Back at Sweet Apple Acres....]</p><br/><br/><p>&quot;Yah sure it's alright to leave Applebloom with him?&quot; asked the large red stallion.</p><p>&quot;Ah can't say ah trust him completely, but ah could tell he was genuinely honest 'bout looking out for her. That and I'm pretty sure he was covering for Sweetie Belle, ah am the element of honesty after all. That Rodney's a decent fellow.&quot; Replied the stetson wearing mare. &quot;Besides those three fillies have gone and done their thing on their own before, ah reckon they can take care of themselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It still don't feel right lettin' him go like that. We could've at least make him work the farm a bit, ah reckon those hands of his can fix up some of the tools in a jiffy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rarity already has that one workin' for her and whoever said ah was lettin' him off?&quot; Big Mac looked quizzically at her causing her to chuckle. &quot;He just volunteered to look after those three through one of their crusading business, knowing nothin' of what's to come. Ah think that's a fair amount of punishment right there dont'cha think?&quot; Big Mac's turn to gaze back towards the distance to see the human figure continue walking down the dirt road towards Ponyville with Sweetie Belle by his side and Applebloom riding on top of him.</p><p>&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: 	I'm finally in the US and have settled down a bit, college is starting again and that means less time to write.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 22 - Add bacon strips add bacon strips add bacon strips<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>I had hoped the lake would be somewhere nearby, around twenty minutes walk perhaps. To my regret it was located at a different side of Ponyville, it wasn’t directly on the opposite but we still had to cut through the town once again to reach it. Sweetie Belle had been lively on our trip to Sweet Apple Acres but now with Applebloom tagging along both fillies went completely ballistic with energy. Having Applebloom ride on top of me was turning out to be a good idea, it made Sweetie Belle stick close by whenever she wanted to talk with Applebloom. Had both fillies been on the ground they probably would have run off everywhere in their attempt to show off the town despite missing a member of their group. Leaving me to spend the rest of the day constantly chasing them down, at least this way I only had to keep my eye on one filly.</p><p>As I traveled through the town I learned something about children: you should never underestimate their impact to the people, or ponies in this case, around you. If you see an unknown creature or even just someone new in the neighborhood, you might be a bit suspicious or apprehensive at first which is completely understandable. But if they were to walk around surrounded by laughing children and playing with them, all notions of danger seem to just disappear. I was greeted with gentle smiles and giggles as we walked through the town which honestly caught me by surprise, it was the good kind of surprise. </p><p>I didn't notice it at first since I was too busy trying to both keep up with Sweetie Belle who kept moving up ahead, and making sure Applebloom stayed seated on top. The earth filly was far too energetic and kept squirming here and there, pointing at shops and buildings and bending over to scream in my ear. She even started tilting my head from side to side in an attempt to steer me. So not only do giving a pony a ride but now she was steering me as well. The irony has been doubled.</p><p>Distance alone meant that getting to the lake was going to take a while, but between the sidetracking and trying to keep the fillies under control, it took considerably more time getting there than it should. It ended up taking roughly an hour and a half to reach the lake. I was already exhausted carrying Sweetie Belle all the way to Sweet Apple Acres but now I was completely drained. Carrying Applebloom was like having a slab of rock over my shoulder while my legs felt like they were made of lead. </p><p>The fillies were right though, we spotted Rainbow Dash flying high in the clouds over the lake with her multi-colored mane and tail flowing behind her as she went through some very flashy and intricate maneuvers. I cringed several times whenever she flew a bit too close to the water. </p><p>&quot;I don't see anyone else besides Rainbow up there, you sure Scootaloo is around?&quot; I asked the two fillies. </p><p>&quot;Oh Scootaloo can’t fly yet but she’s always somewhere near Rainbow Dash, especially when she's practicing.&quot; Replied Sweetie Belle.</p><p>My eyes drifted back to the cerulean mare who was now diving and spinning to the ground in a corkscrew, drilling through several clouds which caused them rotate and follow suit. I froze in place for a moment, gawking upwards at the spectacle as Rainbow Dash continued to create what looked like a miniature tornado.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/2581105dc99c76f0e3fdbbc04d44821568d1f346?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm3.staticflickr.com%2F2247%2F1767624369_b326ec70cd_z.jpg" /></p></div><p>&quot;I gotta admit, that mare certainly knows how to put on a show.&quot; I commented. I was too entranced by the sight to notice how the pegasus had suddenly veered off just before touching the surface of the lake.</p><p>&quot;Oh look she's coming this way!&quot; Shouted Applebloom. Sure enough when my eyes drifted back forward I saw Rainbow Dash flying towards us spraying water upwards behind her with her tailwind alone.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Don't you think she's flying a bit too fast?'</span> <i>He</i> was right, in fact, Rainbow Dash showed no sign of slowing down at all. I squinted my eyes to help focus my vision and was alarmed to see the pegasus glaring right at me with intense concentration.</p><p><i>'Ah shit.'</i></p><p>With reflexes that surprised even myself I exploded into a series of movements, I bent my knees while my arms shot upwards picking Applebloom off me causing her to yelp in surprise. I shifted my weight to my right leg, allowing my body to pivot sideways while carefully tucking the earth filly in front of my stomach with both hands. With a grunt I kicked my right leg out and flew to the side and landed sideways on the dirt. As I jumped the flying pegasus suddenly threw her wings out wide and with a single massive flap flew upwards right in front of where I stood only a second ago. </p><p>I coughed and waved a hand to clear the dust cloud Rainbow had kicked up with sheer wind power alone. &quot;You ok Applebloom?&quot; I looked down and let out a sigh of relief as the filly gave a me a nod. From the looks of it she was a bit disoriented and confused but unharmed. I kept my eye on her as she trotted away just in case she did suffer some injury she weren't aware of, but from the look of it all she got was a dirty coat. I rolled onto my back and hissed in pain as my injuries stung me while swearing under my breath for forgetting them. I took some deep breaths to ease of the shock and hopefully stem of the flow of adrenaline. &quot;The hell was that mare thinking?&quot; I mumbled while gazing at the sky.</p><p>Unfortunately Rainbow Dash wasn't quite through with me yet. My eyes shot open in fright when I saw her descending at free fall speed directly at me, a maniacal grin plastered across her face. Out of reflex, I brought out both arms to cross over my face while bending my legs on top of my stomach in a pitiful attempt to shield myself from the collision. But instead of feeling the bone crushing impact I was hit by a sudden gust of wind pushing me against the earth. I cracked open my eyes to see Rainbow Dash hovering two feet above me with her front hooves folded across and a big smug smile on her face.</p><p>&quot;That,&quot; she shouted while punching a hoof out to point at me, &quot;was for calling me a spy.&quot; I continued to just lay there on the ground with both hands still raised over my head and a bewildered look on my face. This immediately sent Rainbow Dash falling to the ground on her back laughing her head off with all four of her legs kicking the air. </p><p>While Rainbow Dash was busy laughing herself to death, &quot;Oh Celestia it hurts!&quot; I had recovered from the shock and started whispering curses at her while letting my body sag into the dirt as my muscles relaxed to alleviate the tension. Just as I pushed myself up to a sitting position I heard what sounded like a mix of an engine revving and a hummingbird coming from the distance.</p><p>Suddenly Applebloom and Sweetie Belle shouted, &quot;Scootaloo!&quot; I followed their gaze to see a orange colored pegasus filly with purple mane and tail riding what looked like a miniature scooter towards us. She shot her weight sideways forcing the scooter to turn and drift across the dirt kicking up dust as she skidded to a stop a few feet from us.</p><p>&quot;That,&quot; she shouted in between heavy breathing, &quot;was awesome!&quot; Her purple mane was frazzled and had a wild style much like Rainbow Dash, just like the other two this filly she was also missing a mark on her flank. All in all, everything about Scootaloo just screamed out tomboy. </p><p>She kept her gaze on Rainbow mesmerized for several seconds before finally realizing there was an alien sitting just a few feet from her. As her eyes fell on me her ears fell flat on her head and her expression turned to something between confusion and anxiety. But it didn't last long, seeing Applebloom and Sweetie Belle nearby and Rainbow Dash slumped on the ground next to me trying to recover from her laughing fit seem to kill any sense of danger. </p><p>&quot;What are you two doing here? And what the hay is that?&quot; She was eyeing me with a raised eyebrow. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I swear if she says monkey...'</span></p><p>Ignoring that thought, I decided it was probably best if the two fillies explained the situation instead of me since they were friends and all. So I sat on the ground keeping a passive and easy going demeanor while Applebloom and Sweetie Belle trotted over towards Scootaloo. I kept my eye on Rainbow Dash who, with some effort, was finally getting back on her hooves. </p><p>&quot;So what are you doing here with those two?&quot; Rainbow asked while the three fillies chatted amongst each other. </p><p>&quot;We came here hoping to find Scootaloo and get her to come along. I was only suppose to watch Sweetie Belle and get her out of Rarity's mane for a bit. So I told her how she could show me around town and since she and Applebloom were friends I thought it would be nice to invite her along as well.&quot; I tilted my head to the right to point at the girls, &quot;She then told me about Scootaloo and being cu-&quot;</p><p>&quot;CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aah!&quot; They screamed as loud as possible in their high pitched voices, causing me to flinch hard. &quot;Yeah, that.&quot; I continued, &quot;and asked if the whole gang could do it together.&quot; I turned to see all three fillies now running around wearing a red cape with a blue shield and a little yellow pony silhouette on it.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/0b6362867d467535d204aee3e084e406bee83d70?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-sKGzjtO9HYM%2FTbB7fiN8azI%2FAAAAAAAADow%2F9BhBULwe-rE%2Fs1600%2FCapture.PNG" /></p></div><p><i>'Where the hell did those come from?'</i></p><p>&quot;So you're...babysitting them?&quot; she asked incredulously. &quot;Alone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes I know, me being me watching over three kids? Heck I'd be worried.&quot; I gave her a shrug nonchalantly but took on a serious face and tone the second later. &quot;But believe me, I do not take it lightly and I've had some experience with children before. I can't say I'm an expert but I’ve promised both Rarity and Applejack to treat them as my own and I intend to keep it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's....not what I'm worried ab-&quot; but before Rainbow Dash could finish, the fillies, including Scootaloo, ran up and nearly barreled me down. </p><p>&quot;C'mon let's go!&quot; Scootaloo was acting carefree like I was just another pony she just met, I know it's thanks to Applebloom and Sweetie Belle but nevertheless it felt nice not having to explain myself like most first encounters. &quot;You want a tour, we need a cutie-mark and time's a wastin.&quot; She was hopping around with barely contained energy and excitement, more so than the other two. </p><p><i>'And here I was hoping she'd be related to Fluttershy.'</i></p><p>&quot;Hold on now, first things first.&quot; I held out my hand towards her. </p><p>She eyed my hand with a cocked eyebrow before looking back up to me with a face that said, <i>'Are you serious?'</i></p><p>I smiled a bit wider, <i>'Yes.'</i></p><p>With a sigh she placed her right hoof on my palm and we shook, &quot;Rodney.&quot; </p><p>She rolled her eyes, &quot;Scootaloo,&quot; she replied irritably. &quot;Now can we please get going?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Actually, why don't you three eat first?&quot; I suggested. &quot;Applejack gave us some slices of her apple pie earlier on.&quot; Luckily I left Sweetie Belle in charge of carrying the food, originally I gave it to her in order to keep her from running around so much. I doubt it would have survived had I kept it when Rainbow Dash scared me stupid. &quot;You guys eat it while I rest up.&quot;</p><p>Despite being somewhat impatient they didn't argue against it, not surprisingly really considering how good Applejack's pies are. Unfortunately the thought of Applejack's apple pies sent me to depression through a series of thoughts:</p><p><i>Apple pies --&gt; apples --&gt; healthy food --&gt; junk food --&gt; delicious food --&gt; lack of meat  --&gt; a big slab of prime cut beef wrapped in large bacon strips with dry rub seasoning and sizzling over apple firewood</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/7cc2d7569019624ef5ec4488ea0ddd537c7316f6?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldwoodfiregrill.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F12%2FIMG_6819.jpg" /></p></div><p>&quot;Uhh Rodney....you ok?&quot; Rainbow asked. &quot;You're kinda drooling all over yourself there.&quot;</p><p>Rainbow's voice jolted me back into harsh reality, &quot;Oh sorry, kinda lost myself there.&quot; I wiped my chin with my sleeve. I felt miserable now that a multitude of images and memories of meat dishes dominated my mind empowering the empty feeling inside me. Having a subconscious that can directly talk with you didn't help either. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'A big ass New York pastrami melt sandwich still steaming thick with moist, juicy meat with rich oily dipping sauce on the side.'</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/488380edfea0db9613094eda288ef5e10385fac0?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roadfood.com%2Fphotos%2F12926.jpg" /></p></div><p><i>'Please stop.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh god do you remember that vid?

You don't look so hot.&quot; Rainbow was scrutinizing me while I was pinching the bridge of my nose. </p><p>&quot;Just...just trying to fight back a migraine. And hopefully keep my sanity.&quot; I mumbled the last part under my breath.</p><p>&quot;Whatever you say.&quot; I turned to glance around, hoping to find something to keep my mind off the torture. I noticed Rainbow stretching out like a cat and bending her body from side to side while extending the opposite wing out wide. It was then that I realized her wings were far too small to properly give her any sufficient lift to fly, much less the control and strength to pull of her earlier stunts. Twilight had already explained how pegasi fly not with air lift alone but almost entirely by magic, their wings act similarly as unicorn horn in that allows them to manipulate said magic. That got me thinking.</p><p>&quot;Hey Dash help me out with something, do you use your wing to fly? I mean I know you do, but Twilight told me pegasi use magic to fly and wings for control. Is that right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup.&quot; She said between grunts as she continue through her stretching routine. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, if your magic is what gives you flight...how come you get tired?&quot; She paused for a moment to turn and look at me confused. &quot;You use your wings much like a bird would but mostly for control, and obviously that takes physical exertion to maintain. But let's say, theoretically, that you simply fly in one direction with no outside interference like wind and temperature changes, and you never have to use your wings to maintain your flight. Obviously when your magic reserve runs out you can't fly anymore, but when you do run out of magic do feel just as tired? Exhausted?&quot;</p><p>Rainbow Dash had taken a comfortable sitting position next to me with that confused look on her face from before, &quot;Well DUH! Of course I'll be tired, heck I'll pass out if I run out of magic. Everypony does.&quot; I recalled all the moments where I had accidentally drained someone completely. </p><p>My gaze drifted off somewhere, not really focusing on anything, while my mind started putting the puzzle pieces together. &quot;So let's just get this straight for my sake,&quot; I continued. &quot;Ponies that are well and full of energy have a high magic reserve, but if they start doing anything heavy duty and get tired they lose their magic. Is that right?&quot;</p><p>Dash was looking at me like I was an idiot or something, &quot;Again, DUH! Everypony gets tired when they...well, get tired!&quot;</p><p>I turned and looked at her, &quot;Not for me.&quot; I replied flatly. Rainbow tilted her head in confusion, &quot;Not the last part, I do get tired. In fact I'm exhausted right now after walking around town to Sweet Apple Acres and then to here.&quot; I said while waving a hand in each direction and then to the lake. &quot;But I've still got plenty of magic in me. Or to be more accurate, my magic reserve is still the same as it was when Sweetie Belle and I left Carousel Boutique.&quot; I activated my 'Sense' inwards and, sure enough, I could roughly 'feel' the same amount of magic I had earlier in the day. </p><p>&quot;I don't believe you, there's just no way that's true.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It's just a guess right now but it's the only explanation. Magic is magic and stamina is stamina, they're two separate things. I get the occasional headache if I use my spells too long or a particularly complex one. But other than that I don't really get tired unless I <i>physically</i> do.&quot;</p><p>Rainbow was scratching her chin with her hoof and eyeing me up and down, &quot;I dunno, I still say you're lying. But I'm not the bookworm type, you should go ask Twilight. I'm sure she'll give you a lecture on how <i>wrong</i> you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot; I replied lightheartedly with a chuckle. &quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you or anything. Like you said I could be wrong, can't say I've gotten used to the whole magic business yet.&quot; Rainbow gave me a shrug before flexing her wings out wide and getting back on her hooves. </p><p>&quot;It's not like it really matters to me much.&quot; She flapped her wings and hovered a few feet above ground. &quot;You sure you can handle them?&quot; She asked with a hoof pointed towards the three fillies. </p><p>&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I replied confidently. </p><p>&quot;Alright then,&quot; she flew off a bit before turning around and glancing back at me. &quot;Your funeral.&quot;</p><p><i>'Wait, </i><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">what?'</span></p><p>Before I could question Rainbow's comment, &quot;All done!&quot; Shouted the three fillies. I turned to look at their crust covered muzzles smiling at me. </p><p>&quot;Alright let's go, but let's get those cute adorable faces cleaned up first.&quot; Applebloom and Sweetie Belle giggled while Scootaloo made a gagging gesture. But before I even got back on my feet, all three fillies stuck out their tongue and lapped up their muzzles end to end. &quot;That works.&quot; I said with a laugh. </p><p>I took the box that held the apple pie from Sweetie Belle and struck a dramatic pose, &quot;Well then my little crusaders!&quot; Without missing a beat each filly took up a pony version of a salute in front of me. With a wide smile I pointed towards Ponyville, &quot;Onwards! Allons-y!&quot;</p><p>&quot;CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS TOUR GUIDES YAY!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aah!&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN:	And the Cutie-Mark Crusaders are assembled! </p><p>So new semester starting and all, not much time I can put into writing.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 23 - WE GOT BEER PEOPLE!!<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><p>Credit to <a href="/user/teamsapphire" rel="nofollow">teamsapphire</a> for the inspiration.</p><p>AN: Thumbs up for the biggest chapter yet!</p><hr/><p>The trek back to Ponyville was far less laborious than before because: one, I had a chance to rest up and two, Scootaloo decided to ride her scooter instead of me. I could easily tell the offer was extremely tempting for her but for some reason she declined. Her reason being I was far too slow for her liking, but something tells me that was just an excuse. I didn't press the issue considering we'd just met so I seriously doubt she'd indulge my curiosity. Plus, seeing as she was definitely the most energetic and fit of the three I feared she could twist or turn my neck beyond its limits, maybe even break it if I’m not careful. And after the stress Applebloom and Sweetie Belle did on my shoulder I doubt I’ll suffer through one hell of a muscle pain, probably won’t be able to properly lift my hands tomorrow.</p><p>We continued to make our way back to Ponyville with Applebloom and Sweetie Belle trotting by my side while Scootaloo stayed on her scooter ahead of us, loudly egging me to pick up my pace. Obviously, she was still a bit peeved at how slow I was walking. After the first fifteen minutes she gave up complaining and simply played around riding circles around us and joining in on the conversation. For obvious reasons, the topic of our conversations were all mostly about myself or something that has do with me. How I walk on two legs, why I walk on two legs, my clothes, where I came from, how I got here and so forth. However, I hesitated a bit when they questioned about the shackles around my arms. </p><p>My initial thoughts were to simplify the answer, hoping the children would understand, <i>&quot;Because I need them to protect myself&quot;</i> or something like that. It did make me contemplate whether or not I should hide the nature of my powers from public, it would certainly make sense to do so. I can't just walk around saying <i>&quot;OH! They prevent me from sucking up all your magic away because that's just what I do&quot;</i>. </p><p><i>'Rarity was right, there's enough stigma on me already and there's really no reason to add fuel to the flame, I'll have to ask Twilight the next chance I get.'</i></p><p>In the end I simply told them that it was important that I wear them at all times even when sleeping, immediately adding it was just a human thing to stop them from prying any further. I wasn't surprised by their curiosity considering they are children after all. It's why they can ask anything they want without holding anything back. It was quite adorable really and it’s not like we have anything else better to talk about, though unfortunately it got old real quick when they started asking increasingly personal questions. </p><p>&quot;No Applebloom I don't have a girlfriend and yes, that is the human equivalent of a marefriend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Equiwhat?&quot; </p><p>&quot;<i>Equi-va-lent</i>&quot; I spoke the word out slowly to Sweetie Belle. &quot;Means something equal or similar.&quot; I turned to Applebloom cutting in before she could say anything. &quot;And <i>no</i> I'm still not asking your sister out!&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'That's actually not a bad idea, I've been craving for a bite of her apples.'</span></p><p><i>'I'm not dating anyone, let alone a pony just for apples!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I said &quot;her apples&quot;.'</span> I cringed when that image popped into my head, which unfortunately Applebloom misinterpreted. 	</p><p>&quot;Why not!? She ain't good enough fer yah?&quot; Applebloom asked in an upset tone.</p><p>&quot;Because we've only just met and other than growing apples and being an awesome cook I don't know anything else about her.&quot; I took a deep slow breath to calm myself before continuing. &quot;Is it normal for you to hook up your family members?&quot; I threw the question out as a joke but the way all three fillies froze for just the briefest moment was all the answer I needed. &quot;You gotta be kidding me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It...kinda worked.&quot; Sweetie Belle spoke with a small sheepish grin. </p><p>&quot;We just accidentally mixed up potion with poison.&quot; Scootaloo added. </p><p>&quot;Now why in blazes did'ya go and spout that off?&quot; Applebloom shouted, &quot;he don't need tah know that part!&quot;</p><p>I pinched the bridge of my nose and let out a long sigh while Applebloom started bickering with Scootaloo, &quot;Alright that's enough of that.&quot; I decided it was best to change the subject, mostly for my sake. &quot;So which part of Ponyville are you girls taking me to first?&quot; They all paused for a second before putting a hoof on their chin, obviously neither of them had given it much thought or none at all. &quot;Why don't we just walk around town and you three can tell me what's what and who's who?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess that'll work.&quot; replied Scootaloo.</p><p>&quot;Sounds simple, I like it.&quot; added Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;Ah'm ok with that.&quot; Applebloom concluded. </p><p>&quot;Good,&quot; I gazed up to the sky, &quot;cause by the looks of it we won't have time to see all of it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who's fault is that?&quot; Scootaloo said irritably at me. I let her have the last word in and continued on towards Ponyville which was already in sight. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before the conversation veered back to my love life.</p><p>&quot;Why don't you ask Rainbow Dash out? There's nopony cooler than Rainbow Dash.&quot; Scootaloo asked. </p><p>&quot;Is not, he's asking Applejack out!&quot; shouted Applebloom.</p><p>&quot;Is too.&quot;	</p><p>&quot;Is not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is too!&quot;	</p><p>&quot;Is not!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Girls no more arguing! And I am not asking anyone out on a date.&quot; I spoke in a tired tone. </p><p>&quot;Yeah! It's rude making him ask somepony he doesn't like on a date.&quot; I looked down at Sweetie Belle pleasantly surprised. </p><p>&quot;Thank you Sweetie Belle, that's nice of you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;He clearly prefers Rarity seeing as she's the most beautiful and ladylike pony in Ponyville.&quot; Sweetie Belle added with a hint of pride in her voice.</p><p>&quot;Oh for the love of god.&quot; I let out another frustrated breath as the three fillies suddenly fell into a heated argument which soon enough became more of a shouting contest. It was evidently clear I wasn't going to be able to stop them at this point so I just tried to ignore them as we traveled. I could only hope they'd get bored and move on by the time we reached Ponyville. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[About 20 mins later, in Ponyville....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rainbow Dash is the best flyer in Equestria!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Applejack’s the toughest mare!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But Rarity is the most beautiful!&quot;</p><p>The bad news is that they haven't stopped, good news is that the conversation soon became an argument of whose a better pony. I should probably have stopped them, but I feared they would most likely just revert back to the original topic. Still, I can't walk around town with them screaming like that. </p><p>&quot;Girls that's enough we're-Girls!&quot; None of them were paying attention. &quot;Oh for crying out loud.&quot; I was about to lift them all an inch from the ground to grab their attention but due to recent events I've made it a habit to question my actions further than I usually do. Setting three fillies alight in blue flames would definitely send the townsfolk into a frenzy. So instead I moved in closer and cast my shadow over the three fillies. It took several seconds for them to realize the sudden loss of light in the area but soon enough each filly slowly turned and tilted their head to look up at me. </p><p><i>'Time for some payback.'</i></p><p>Before either of them could say or do anything I bent over and reached out towards Sweetie Belle and Applebloom and grabbed them both by the side. With my fingers under their belly I immediately started tickling them and poking at their ribs, sending them into the agonizing embrace of a tickle attack. </p><p>&quot;Hahahaaa! Rodney! Hahaaa! S-stop!&quot; shouted Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;Kyaahaahaaahaha! Quit it-haahahaha! Ah'ma wet myself!&quot; screamed Applebloom.</p><p>They tried to run away but I easily prevented that by lifting them just an inch above ground which made them kick about randomly, trying to use the momentum to free themselves. I continued to torture them for about a minute before finally letting them off and dropping them to the ground only to turn my gaze upon Scootaloo who has been giggling and laughing at her friend's expense. Her mirth immediately died the moment my eyes locked on to her with a mad glee clearly showing my intent.</p><p>&quot;Ponyfeathers.&quot; She started galloping off towards her scooter hoping to run away, or tried to. Unfortunately for her I'd glued one of her hooves to the ground with my magnet spell, a very weak one meant to simply trip her over so it only made her hoof glow a bit instead of catching fire. After all, not a lot of ponies know how my spells look and I didn't want to frighten her to death thinking she caught fire out of nowhere. Her tumble gave me enough time to reach out and grabbed the orange pegasus by one of her hind hooves and dragged her back towards me. </p><p>&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; She screamed while trying to dig into the earth, creating twin ditches as I continued to pull her closer. Unlike Sweetie Belle and Applebloom I focused entirely on torturing Scootaloo and tickled her with both hands on each side of her body. She tried to squirm and flee my grasp, much like the other two who were now getting back on their hooves but to no avail. Instead of enjoying Scootaloo’s predicament much as she did theirs, Applebloom and Sweetie Belle leaped on my back wrapping their hooves around my neck screaming at the top of their lungs.</p><p>&quot;CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS TICKLE HUMAN CATCHERS!!&quot; Out reflex I tried to cover both my ears with my hands only to lose balance and fall on my back. Luckily I was already crouched low so neither Sweetie Belle nor Applebloom were hurt from the fall nor from my weight. These ponies probably have a greater body density than humans do. </p><p>I didn't really have much time to think further on it because as soon as Applebloom and Sweetie Belle wormed their way out from under me they immediately jumped right on top and started to to exact their revenge. Despite their lack of fingers these ponies somehow found a way to tickle my sides and dig their way past my clothes, the sensation of their fur on my skin only made it worse. However one thing still remains a fact: hooves are freakin hard. As a result I was laughing hard from the tickles yet at the same time was suffering in pain from the flat ends of their hooves which felt like jabs and punches. </p><p>&quot;Hahahahaha-wait Sweetie Be-AH! Applebloom that's my kidn-GAHahahaha! No wait Scoota-GUUUHH!&quot; Scootaloo somehow got the bright idea to leap up as high as she could with her wings flapping like a bee trying to gain as much altitude as possible before dropping dead center on my chest right between Applebloom and Sweetie Belle. &quot;I give hehehehahahahaaa! Surrender! Mercy!&quot; It was only after I pleaded so did they finally stopped beating my ass. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'This is just sad.'</span></p><p>I laid at the ground trying to catch my breath which took some effort with Scootaloo standing on top of me striking a pose with her right front hoof pointed towards the sky. &quot;I claim this victory in the name of the Cutie-Mark Crusaders!&quot; She shouted which caused the other two to yell and hop in circles around me. I could hear the laughter and giggles from the nearby ponies who stopped to watch the scene. Whether they were laughing at me or just enjoying the scene didn't really matter much to me, in fact it might help them see me less of a threat.  </p><p>I reached out and lifted Scootaloo and placed her on the ground next to me before finally getting back on my feet, only to see the three fillies looking down at the ground with a disappointed pout. &quot;What's gotten to you three?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;We didn't get our cutie-marks.&quot; Sweetie Belle answered.</p><p>&quot;As...tickle human catchers?&quot; All three nodded their heads in sync. </p><p><i>'Exactly how desperate are they?'</i> </p><p>&quot;Cheer up girls, I'm sure you'll get them someday. Besides you still haven't shown me around town yet.&quot; </p><p>Their looked at each other for a moment, &quot;Oh yeah, forgot 'bout that.&quot; spoke Applebloom. </p><p>The moment I saw each filly took a deep breath I immediately stuffed my ears with a finger, &quot;CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS TOUR GUIDES! YAY!&quot;</p><p>I merely shook my head at their antics before we finally set off to explore the town in random. It didn't take long for us to settle down to routine, mostly we would walk around town and I would try to commit the sights into memory while keeping an eye on the fillies. Once in awhile I would ask them about a store or building that caught my interest. Some of the buildings in town had a sign hanging on atop the front but it was either a picture or symbol and never contain any actual words, from what I could tell they were all either stores or some service. One particular building had what appeared to be a picture of a large sand hourglass which at first I thought it was some kind of time shop or maybe even an antique shop, however the interior design and look suggested it wasn’t a store at all. </p><p>&quot;So what's this place?&quot; I asked the fillies. When I didn't get an immediate reply like I usually did I looked at them and saw how each filly had an irritated look on their faces. </p><p>&quot;Can we skip this one?&quot; Scootaloo begged which of course only made me that much more interested. </p><p>&quot;That didn't sound like something a professional tour guide would say, what happened to all that enthusiasm?&quot; They each turned to look at each other nervously. &quot;Oh come now girls, how bad can it be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's the dentist.&quot; Replied Applebloom in a sour tone.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Ah, that explains it.'</span></p><p><i>'I know these ponies are quite advance in medicine and health care so dentistry shouldn't be much of a surprise. But still....hooves.'</i></p><p>&quot;Am I correct to assume the dentist is a unicorn?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, how'd you know?&quot; replied Scootaloo.</p><p><i>'Because if it wasn't for magic I'd wager going to the dentist includes some fatal risk. Or a dislocated jaw.'</i></p><p>&quot;Just a guess.&quot; I answered with a shrug. &quot;C'mon let's go in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do we really have to? Can't we just stay out here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sweets I promise you're not having an appointment, none of you are. And I promised to keep an eye on you so no, I'm not leaving any of you alone.&quot; Hearing they were safe from the dentist's care we proceeded inside the building. </p><p>Much like Carousel Boutique there was a bell above the door which rang to signal our presence. The entrance room was pretty much a simple waiting room with two couches against the wall with a small table in the center, all in all it all felt cozy. I waited for several moments until the back door opened to reveal a unicorn mare with light blue coat with a deeper and lighter shade of blue for her mane and tail. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/796318d74c53e442bb99a5076ddda981a89f167d?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fkym-assets%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Foriginal%2F000%2F129%2F123%2Fcolgate___not_on_ice_this_time_by_moongazeponies-d3g7kqw.png%3F1306978168" /></p></div><p>The moment she saw me her expression became one of uncertainty and anxiety, &quot;Uhh can I...help you?&quot; With some hesitation she trotted up to the stand behind the counter while I kept a non threatening demeanor. However her hesitation and fear was replaced by confusion when she spotted the Crusaders standing behind me. &quot;Girls? What are you three doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hi Doctor Colgate.&quot; They all spoke in a synchronized, unenthusiastic tone.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'A dentist named Colgate....this world just keeps on throwing it huh?'</span></p><p>Considering this was our first meeting I decided to put on the Rarity act again, &quot;Hello Doctor...Colgate was it? My name is Rodney, I'm sure you've heard about me.&quot; I gently extended my right hand out over the counter towards her causing her to stare at my shackles in confusion. &quot;Please don't let it confuse you, I am by no means anyone dangerous and have no ill intent towards anyone. My reasons for wearing them are....complicated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I....see.&quot; There was some clear hesitation but eventually she placed her hoof on my palms and we greeted each other. </p><p>&quot;I was just exploring the town and trying to take in the sights with the help of these children. Am I to understand that you are the resident dentist in Ponyville?&quot; I could almost feel the girl's confusion at my sudden change change in my speech.</p><p>&quot;Yes you are correct, my name is Minuette.&quot; I tilted my head in confusion. &quot;Colgate is just a nickname Pinkie Pie called me during my 'Welcome to Ponyville' party and it sorta stuck,&quot; she explained. &quot;Still not sure why she called me that in the first place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A pleasure to meet you Minuette.&quot; I gave her a small simple bow. &quot;The reason I came into your establishment was simply out of curiosity and I had hoped to begin befriending new ponies. I just hope I wasn't disturbing your busy schedule.&quot; Either it was my manner of speech or seeing girls being comfortable with me, calmed her down rather quickly.</p><p>&quot;Oh I see, well I'm always up to meeting new ponies-er, sorry but what are you exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Human ma'am.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh please call me Minuette, or Colgate, take your pick.&quot; she replied with a shrug. &quot;And don't worry about bothering me, my last appointment for today already left some time ago.&quot; She turned to walk around the counter and made her way to stand in front of me. It was then that I noticed the sign out front was the exact replica of her mark, a sand hourglass. </p><p>&quot;I'm sorry if this sounds too personal but, is it not true that cutie-marks represent the talent one is most gifted at?&quot; I asked gently. </p><p>&quot;You're wondering what my cutie-mark have to do with dentistry right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it's not too bold of me to ask.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry about it, everypony ask about it all the time. My special talent is simply for always being on time, I've never been late for pretty much anything less I can help it. I simply have a gift for remembering where I need to be, when I need to be there, and what I should do to make it on time. Now you might be wondering, how that has anything to do with dental care? You see I found out I can help keep track of things other ponies might forget. My parents thought I was meant to be a secretary or somepony's assistant, maybe even for Princess Celestia herself. Instead I turned to general health care in order to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;To keep track of everyone's health and well being.&quot; I finished. </p><p>&quot;Correct, I actually work together with Ponyville Hospital to keep track of everypony's health and make necessary appointments for ponies who otherwise might forget. Monthly appointments, yearly injections and making sure everypony remember to stock up on any medication they might need, to name a few. Dentistry is simply something I've fallen in love with, you'd be surprised how much you can learn about somepony from studying their teeth.&quot;</p><p>I chuckled at her last comment, &quot;I'm not sure I actually want to know that much about someone, too much power for my taste. Well then Colgate, it's very nice to meet you.&quot; With a wide smile I bent over and extended my hand again for a shake. </p><p>Out of nowhere Colgate suddenly jumped and pushed me down to the floor, luckily I was quick enough to balance myself out so instead of falling on my injured back I fell on my ass in a sitting position. </p><p>&quot;Uhm Rodney, there's something you might want to know about doctor Col-&quot; But before Sweetie Belle could finish, Colgate reached up and pulled my face down forcing me to look at her with her muzzle only a few centimeters away from my face. I could smell her breath which was extremely minty and fresh. </p><p>&quot;You have FANGS!?&quot; She had a maniacal grin splayed across her face. </p><p>&quot;Uh...yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you carnivore?&quot; I'm not sure how but she somehow found a right angle to squeeze my cheeks with both her front hooves forcing me to open my mouth. Quicker than I thought possible she shoved the edge of both her front hooves into my mouth and pried it open further. &quot;No wait you have molars in the back, an omnivore then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uaah ah hu hoih!?&quot; I grasped both her hooves and tried to pry myself free but she just wouldn't budge. </p><p>&quot;Shuush, don't bother me! Oh this is so exciting! The only other meat eaters I've treated were gryphons and they don’t have any teeth. What in Celestia am I suppose to do with beaks!?&quot; </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'If this goes on she'll rip out our jaw.'</span> Unfortunately I was inclined to agree from the way she kept prying my mouth to open wider.</p><p>At first I was about to drain her just enough to pry her hooves away but it was tough trying to concentrate while someone was splitting your face in half. Even if I could Twilight will only give me hell later, so I decided to apply some scare tactic instead. I traced the inside of my mouth with a levitation spell that hardly had enough magic to have any effect, however there was enough of to make my mouth look like a small furnace.</p><p>To my surprise the blue unicorn wasn't fazed at all, in fact she even started scolding me. &quot;Now that <i>can't</i> be healthy! It might kill some germs but think of the gums!&quot; She was inching closer and closer and I was certain she was about to stick her muzzle inside my mouth just to get a closer look at my teeth. </p><p>Seeing as she wasn't at all frightened or even startled by my spells I decided it was relatively safe to use my spells on her, though I'll have to explain it to the girls after. I terminated the levitation spell in my mouth and immediately cast a magnet spell on her flank and another one of the opposite polarity to the wall behind her. Unfortunately I'd underestimated Colgate’s tenacity, the spell was working just fine and she was being pulled towards the wall however she suddenly wrapped her hooves around my head thus dragging my ass along for the ride. From my seated position I tried to create as much traction as possible with my hands and feet but this mare just wouldn't let me go. </p><p><i>'Gods it's like she has hooves like a-'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Horse?'</span></p><p><i>'Not now dammit!'</i></p><p>As if that wasn’t enough the Crusaders have decided to lend a hand, or hoof I guess. &quot;CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS TO THE RESCUE!!&quot; Although I couldn't turn my head thanks to Colgate, I was still able to sort of guess what transpired. </p><p>I could feel one of the fillies biting down on the back of my shirt and started pulling back hard, from her voice I would wager it was Sweetie Belle, &quot;Kah'mon hirls! Phull!&quot; I could feel the other two <i>helping</i> when Sweetie Belle suddenly started pulling twice as hard. </p><p>Despite Colgate's iron grip hooves were still hooves and her fur only made it easier to slip off. The moment we broke contact was like a slingshot sending the fillies and myself flying backwards into a messy pile. Colgate on the other hand hit the wall with a loud <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.25em">THUD</span> which made me worry, but she easily picked herself up from the floor with her flank still stuck to the wall. </p><p>&quot;Time to go!&quot; I shouted while grabbing all three fillies of the floor. With Sweetie Belle under my left arm and the other two on my right, with Scootaloo being upside down, I carried them out the front door as fast as I safely could. </p><p>Before I even hit five feet from the building we could hear Colgate shouting from inside, &quot;You'll have to come see me one day Rodney! I'll get my hooves on those fangs you hear me!? No teeth lasts forever!&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Thank you teamsapphire for the Colgate scene.)</p></div><p>My pace quickened as I continued to carry the three fillies away from the mad dentist, who knew anyone could be so obsessed with teeth. Though seeing as most of her clients are herbivores I can somewhat understand the thrill of working with an unknown or exotic, I guess being a meat eater counts as the later. </p><p>Once I finally got enough distance to feel relatively safe I settled the laughing fillies down the ground, with exception to Scootaloo who had suddenly taken on a greener color. &quot;You ok there Scoots?&quot;</p><p>With some effort she nodded while trying to keep herself from blowing chunks, &quot;I think so.&quot; We took a break under the shade of a nearby tree giving time for Scootaloo to settle down. &quot;But what about the fire though? Shouldn't we ask somepony for help?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yeah about that,&quot; I waited until each filly focused their attention on me. &quot;Those flames you saw earlier is actually how my spells manifest themselves,&quot; they looked confusedly at me. &quot;What my spells look like,&quot; I clarified. &quot;I'm actually surprised you two didn't panic when you saw it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it weren't fer Sweetie Belle ah probably would actually.&quot; Applebloom jerked her head a bit towards Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;Same here, I just jumped the moment she screamed for help.&quot; added Scootaloo.</p><p>&quot;Well I've seen it when Rodney and I was cleaning up the boutique before so....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well I guess I know who to thank then.&quot; I reached out and rubbed Sweetie Belles head causing her to laugh and giggle again before dodging away beyond my reach. &quot;Alright then, let's change thing up a bit. What's the first place that comes to mind when you hear 'Ponyville'?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;The boutique!&quot; shouted Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;The farm.&quot; replied Applebloom.</p><p>&quot;Rainbow Dash.&quot; mumbled Scootaloo.</p><p>&quot;That ain't even a place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well it should! Somepony should name someplace after her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough.&quot; I warned before Applebloom and Scootaloo could fall into another argument. &quot;Alright, second place then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sugarcube Corner.&quot; they answered instantly.</p><p>&quot;Third?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our clubhouse!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok cool where's that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In mah farm.&quot; answered Applebloom. </p><p>&quot;Ok last shot then. What's next?&quot; They contemplated in silence for a few seconds.</p><p>&quot;We'll it's not exactly <i>a</i> place...&quot; spoke Sweetie Belle.</p><p>&quot;More like several.&quot; added Applebloom.</p><p>&quot;There's this street called Hoofpoint that has the best shops in town.&quot; Scootaloo's color was slowly returning when she spoke. &quot;It has the coolest toy shop where I got my scooter.&quot; She pointed to her scooter in the distance which was leaning next to the front door of Colgate's establishment.</p><p>&quot;Ah that's right, we forgot you scooter back there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No worries, I leave it around town all the time. Most ponies know it's mine.&quot; She tried standing as tall as possible while puffing out her chest in a proud manner. &quot;Because nopony else can ride my scooter like I can!&quot;</p><p><i>'I guess I shouldn't be surprised how there's hardly any crime here, I've yet to see or hear anyone being arrested. I don't know if the entire world is like this or it’s just this town in particular.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'That'll take some time getting used to.'</span></p><p>&quot;Yer also gonna find the candy shop there!&quot; Applebloom was getting excited while licking her lips. &quot;It's as good as Sugarcube Corner except instead of pastries it's all candies!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's also where we get some of the stuff we need when we go Crusading for our cutie-marks.&quot; Sweetie Belle was just as enthusiastic about the shops there. &quot;There's even a hardware store where you can get power tools!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And exactly how did you know where to get power tools?&quot; Before either could answer I raise a hand to stop them. &quot;Forget I asked.&quot; With a grunt I pushed myself off the ground and got back on my feet. &quot;Well it's a good place as any I suppose, shall we get going then?&quot;</p><p>We made our way at a casual pace towards Hoofpoint street with the girls leading the way while I tried to strike up a casual conversation to help pass the time. This time though I took the reins, so to speak, of the conversation asking some basic information about them and their daily life as well as about myself to get better acquainted. I learned about the school they attend which sounded a lot like pre-school back on my world though there are some differences. For instance each race of ponies would undergo a different test or examination once in awhile specific to their abilities. For obvious reasons earth ponies tend to be excused from such events though they do have one specifically for them, just far less frequent. </p><p>The fillies were right though, Hoofpoint was everything they mentioned and then some. Every building on the street were all mostly shops and services of a wide variety, from sweet shops to mechanical hardware and even a gym, were all lined up along the way. The street was quite lively with quite a number of ponies going about their business with unicorns floating their purchased items while the rest either used saddlebags or just carried them in their mouths. It reminded me of Trademare's Street but the stores there mostly sell supplies and raw materials instead of finished products.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Guess that explains the name.' </span></p><p>&quot;So where to first?&quot;</p><p>&quot;........&quot;</p><p>&quot;Girls?&quot; I looked down and around but the fillies who were just standing next to me a second ago were gone without a trace. &quot;GIRLS!?&quot; My heart skipped a beat and I had to take a couple of deep breaths to calm myself and prevent a panic attack. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Easy now, this ain't our world so don't go jumping to conclusions. They probably just ran off somewhere.'</span></p><p><i>'Ok so where would three fillies like them go in a street like-'</i> The answer came to me faster than I could finish questioning myself. I ran down the street while scrutinizing every store and their symbols on both sides and before long I halted to a stop right in front of a sign with a picture of three wrapped candies.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/e593fbb60f737b36671213b2925ed2550263ca1a?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimages2.wikia.nocookie.net%2F__cb20111008162857%2Fmlpfanart%2Fimages%2Fthumb%2Fe%2Fe5%2FBon_Bon%27s_Cutie_Mark.png%2F481px-Bon_Bon%27s_Cutie_Mark.png" /></p></div><p>Despite my efforts to remain calm I entered the candy store a bit too aggressively causing quite a commotion, making the ponies inside turn their heads to stare at me. I didn’t pay them much mind and they mostly went unnoticed as I scanned each row and corner of the store for those fillies. I let out a sigh of relief once I spotted them busy tinkering with some large machine in the back of the store. </p><p>&quot;Excuse me, but could you please move out of the way? You're blocking the door.&quot; A cream colored earth pony was standing in front of me with an irritated look on her face. Her mane and tail had a startling contrast of pink and dark blue while her mark was the exact same three wrapped candies as the sign outside. Behind her stood several ponies of varying age carrying small colorful bags trying to leave the store. </p><p>&quot;Oh sorry I was just...sorry.&quot; I took a few steps sideways into the store where the ponies slowly made a line to exit the building, each of them glanced sideways at me as they passed by me.</p><p>&quot;I take it you're the one everypony's been talking about?&quot; Asked the cream colored mare from before, she was eyeing me up and down giving disapproving looks. At first I thought she meant the shackles on my arms but looking down at myself I realize she probably meant everything about me. My clothes were heavily stained with dirt and bits of foliage after the trip to the farm, not to mention the smell after bathing in my own sweat all day. &quot;I'm sorry but I have to ask you leave my store, it's not anything personal it's just I can't have you accidentally contaminating any of my products.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Funny hearing that from a race that actually eats plants from dirt.'</span></p><p>&quot;It'll ruin the flavor.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh.'</span></p><p>&quot;I'm sorry ma'am but I can't,&quot; I replied in a calm manner. &quot;I'm currently responsible for those three,&quot; I pointed towards the Crusaders who were still busy playing with the machine completely oblivious to us. &quot;I'm not implying their in any danger while inside your store but I did gave my word I'd keep an eye on them.&quot; </p><p><i>'Probably both my eyes after their little disappearing act.'</i></p><p>She looked back down to gaze at my shackles suspiciously, turning around to the girls she shouted, &quot;Girls! Do you know this....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Human.&quot; </p><p>&quot;This human?&quot; The three fillies turned their heads to look at us.</p><p>&quot;Yup!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p>Satisfied that I was telling her the truth she turned and spoke to me with a bit more warmly than before, &quot;So do you have a name mister human?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just call me Rodney ma'am, and please don't worry about me. These chains are there for an entirely different reasons other than what you think.&quot; I bent over and held out my hand. &quot;I am simply here hoping to better know the ponies I'll be living with, nothing more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose the Princess wouldn't send somepony dangerous to live with us.&quot; She placed her hoof on my hands and we shook. &quot;Bon Bon, welcome to my candy shop. But back to the matter at hoof, those three are my regular customers but that doesn't mean you can hang around my store looking like that.&quot; She raised a hoof and pointed towards a door on the side, &quot;The bathroom is through there, you should find everything you need to clean yourself up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're letting me into your home after we just met?&quot; </p><p>&quot;I live a few blocks from here with my roommate actually, all the extra rooms I have act as kitchens and storerooms.&quot; She added before pointing to the door a second time, &quot;Bathroom, clean, now. Or do I have to drag you in there?&quot;</p><p>I raised my eyebrow surprised at her forwardness, &quot;I take it you're the dominant one in the house then?&quot; I teased as I made my way towards the door. </p><p>&quot;Somepony has to keep that unicorn in line,&quot; she commented before trotting towards a line of ponies. &quot;Now if you'll excuse me I have to attend the store.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Uhm one more question, what are those three doing with that machine?&quot; I jerked my head to point at the machine. &quot;It's not dangerous is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh that? It's my candy maker, something I design to let the kids make their own candies. You can change the flavor, size, color and so much more.&quot; There was a great sense of pride in her voice. </p><p>&quot;I take it the machine uses magic?&quot; </p><p><i>'That or this mare must be some mechanical genius to create such a complex piece of machinery.'</i></p><p>&quot;It does actually, I designed it but my roommate wove the spells and enchanted it for me. She drops by to power it up once a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No I meant if it...nevermind.&quot; I made my way past the door as Bon Bon went back to her customers. The bathroom was just where she said it was, it was very basic and shared the same design as Twilight's library. That made me pause for at the door for a moment, remembering back to that event I decided to take some precaution. Turning on my 'Sense' I scanned every nook and cranny of the bathroom with my 'Sight' for any trace of magic, specifically upwards at the ceiling. Fortunately as far as I could tell the bathroom was completely free of any magical influence, they probably design the store to work manually because the owner was an earth pony or something. </p><p><i>'Then again, Twilight's house was an actually living tree so that might be a special case.'</i> With no threat of any catastrophe I began undressing and tried my best to clean up my clothes, even with magic, before finally getting into the shower for a quick wash up. All the while contemplating how I would scold those three for disappearing from me like that.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Meanwhile.....]</p></div><p>&quot;You really think he'll like it?&quot; asked Sweetie Belle. </p><p>&quot;Of course he will, who doesn't like candy?&quot; replied Scootaloo she threw the ninth block of sugar into the machine.</p><p>&quot;I guess,&quot; Sweetie Belle was still feeling unsure about the whole idea. &quot;I still think we shouldn't have run off like that, don't you think he'll be mad at us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry 'bout it Sweetie Belle, ah'm sure he'll forget it all once we surprise him with the best candies in Equestria.&quot; Applebloom was busy setting and turning the various dials and knobs around the back of the machine. </p><p>&quot;Are you sure you know what you're doing? Bon Bon said to use these controls.&quot; Sweetie Belle pointed towards another set of colorful dials and buttons which looked much simpler to use.</p><p>&quot;But none of them makes the candy any bigger.&quot; There were a few more clicks and squeaks as Applebloom continued to tinker with the machine. &quot;Since he's bigger than anypony ah've seen he probably eats more candies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does that mean Princess Celestia also eats more than everypony?&quot; Asked Scootaloo as she threw in the thirteenth block of sugar.</p><p>&quot;Ah.......guess?&quot; There was a moment of silence as each filly pictured their own version of their divine ruler stuffing her face with food.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Elsewhere.....]</p></div><p>As Celestia made her way towards her throne room she felt a sudden jolt of ice travel up her back making the fur on her neck stand at their ends. </p><p>&quot;Somepony knows.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/33b62e30b98651b47eef80398880c6c07b7c5be4?url=http%3A%2F%2Fth09.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2FPRE%2Ff%2F2011%2F268%2F4%2Ff%2Fsurprised_celestia_by_spinnyhat-d4aw9rg.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back at Bon Bon's shop.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Well, ah think that does it.&quot; Applebloom came out from behind the machine just as Scootaloo threw in several more blocks of sugar. &quot;How many of those have'ya thrown in?&quot;</p><p>Scootaloo tapped her chin in thought, &quot;I lost count, but the sweeter the better right?&quot; Scootaloo threw in another block before they made their way to stand next to Sweetie Belle in front of a big red button. </p><p>&quot;Everything ready?&quot; asked Sweetie Belle. </p><p>&quot;Yup!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, here goes nothing.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[In the bathroom.....]</p></div><p>I scrutinized myself in the mirror and felt quite pleased with my accomplishment, my clothes were still stained with brown patches of dirt but at the least it looked like I fell down rather than rolling around on the dirt and dead leaves, which I did. Confident that Bon Bon wouldn’t kick me out, I left the bathroom and made my way back towards the storefront. But just as I was about to reach for the door something hit it from the other side, leaving a sizable dent and sending splinters flying at me. </p><p>&quot;What the hell!?&quot; Only moments ago the only sound I could hear was the occasional chatter and ponies walking around the store, but now there were cries of fear and panic. The moment I pushed through the door I immediately dropped to the floor in order to dodge something that flew straight at my face. From what I could tell it looked like a colorful jawbreaker the size of a two footballs.</p><p>Looking around there was absolute chaos, Bon Bon and several other ponies were laying low hiding behind whatever shelter they could find trying to shield themselves from the giant projectiles flying about the room. One unlucky stallion was dangling from the ceiling with strands of melted sugar. How he got up there in the first place was beyond me. The machine at the back had gone completely crazy, jumping up and down as it continued to shoot out giant colorful treats randomly into the room. Some hit and stuck to the wall like they were made of glue, while others continued to ricochet from the walls like rubber balls. There were dangerous ones however, they appeared to be solid hard rock candy that could probably punch a hole into the walls, in fact there were already some holes around the room. From what I could tell the machine was shooting these things randomly in a variety of colors, making it impossible to guess what type of candy it was until it's too late. As far as I could tell nobody was actually hurt, frightened and confused probably, but they should count themselves lucky. </p><p>Keeping myself low I carefully crept my way towards Bon Bon who was hiding behind her counter, &quot;What happened!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I don't know! I heard the machine making weird noises and it suddenly started shooting giant candies at everypony! I never designed it to do that!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where are the kids?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Last time I saw them they were still by the machine!&quot; I poked my head out over the counter only to jerk back down when one flying candy landed just a few inches away from my head. </p><p>&quot;GIRLS!! CAN YOU HEAR ME!?&quot; I shouted at the top of my lungs.</p><p>&quot;Rodney! Help!!&quot; Sweetie Belle's high pitched voice sent a wave of relief over me. </p><p>&quot;Sweetie Belle is Applebloom and Scootaloo with you?! Are you all safe?!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ah'm here!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me too! We're behind the machine!!&quot; Once I heard where they were I let out a sigh of relief. From what I could tell the machine was shooting towards the store and away from them. For the moment those three are probably at the safest place right now, right in the eye of the storm. </p><p>&quot;Stay where you are and no matter what DON'T COME NEAR THE MACHINE!!&quot; I took a few deep breaths to calm myself before activating my 'Sense' in an attempt to drain the magical enchantments on the machine. Unfortunately the machine was beyond the range of my powers which means that I have to get closer in order to shut it down. Diving back in my memory I envisioned the scene of the room, trying to remember every detail as I formulate a plan to navigate my way through the chaos.</p><p><i>'If I'm right there should be an overturned table that should be close to put me in range of the machine.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'But there's absolutely no shelter between here and there, we'll have to navigate through the line of fire to reach it.'</span></p><p><i>'I've got a shield spell that can block a kick from Luna, I think it can handle a few jawbreaker missiles.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Only it's not designed to cover our entire body remember? We agreed it was too inefficient to make one like that.'</span></p><p><i>'Then I'll just cast two of them on my arms, they'll stick even when I move and-'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And practically give us a set of bucklers.'</span></p><p><i>'Oh wow that is irritating. How's our magic reserve?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Plenty, but don't let that get to your head. Looking at how fast those things fly they must pack quite a punch.'</span></p><p><i>'Alright let's do this.'</i> Since the conversation took place in my mind with adrenaline pumping in my veins, the entire thing took only took several seconds in real time. Taking several more deep breaths I began concentrating on weaving my magic to create the same passive shield spell on the back of both hands. It only took a fraction of the time it did the first time since I merely had to duplicate the spell, plus there wasn’t any time to hesitate or second guess in this situation. Once I finished weaving the spell I cast it on each hand making them flicker with azure fire for the briefest moment before disappearing. </p><p>&quot;What was that? Was that fire!? What are you planning to do!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry Bon Bon but there's not time to explain, just sit tight and stay low.&quot; I inched towards the edge of the counter and poked my head out hoping to get a view of table. The machine was still vibrating and jumping wildly, but so far it kept it's aim directed away from the girls. With another steady set of breaths I took a running position in the corner while trying to get the rhythm of the machine, which so far appeared to launch with one second delay in between. </p><p><i>'One. Fire. Two. Fire. Three. Fire. Four. GO!'</i> I pushed my legs out as hard as I could sending me into a leap before falling into a sprint just the machine shot a sticky glob of sugar towards the opposite side of the store. I pumped my legs as fast as possible with my arms at the ready while trying to keep myself as small a target as I could. From the looks of it the table was only a few strides away and luckily for me the machine has been firing off away from me. </p><p>I can’t say the same for the poor stallion still dangling from the roof completely defenseless. He got hit right in the side of this body making him grunt and pain though he should still consider himself lucky, the projectile appear to be the rubbery kind and kept bouncing around the room as it hit the floor. I hesitated for a moment looking back and forth between the stallion and the machine trying to decided which to go for first. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Kill the machine you eliminate the danger!'</span></p><p><i>'Right.'</i> I was about to start sprinting again but unfortunately my hesitation cost me too much time. Before I realized it I was hit on my side with a glob of sugary concoction. I was more surprised than I was hurt so I kept running towards the table with my hands ready to intercept the next assault. I was about two strides away from the table when my left leg suddenly refused to follow through with my movement, causing me to fall hard to the floor. I cursed as I twisted my body around to inspect my leg, the glob of sugar I was hit with earlier had trickled down and had practically glued my leg to the floor. </p><p>&quot;Ah you've got to be-woah!&quot; The sound of splitting wood nearby reminded me I was currently sitting duck in the open. I tried to use brute force to rip my leg free but the glob held me down firmly and wouldn't let go. I turned to look at the machine just as it launched a big red colored ball of sugary death directly at me.</p><p>I raised both hands just in time to block its path causing an explosion of blue light to shower the room as both shields on my hands exploded to life causing the red candy ball to ricochet off harmlessly over me. I was however reminded of one flaw in my shield that I have yet to correct, it may block the actual impact and collision but it did not divert the force behind it. Much like the incident with Luna the force would have sent me skidding across the floor towards the shelves behind me were it not for my leg being stuck to the floor. </p><p>&quot;Aaw ffffffuck...&quot; My hands however suffered the most damage since it was what captured almost the entire force of the impact. The force, plus the added weight of the shackles around my arms, sent them flying back, almost dislocating both my shoulders. In all honesty it felt like I had just tried to catch a cannonball with my bare hands, considering the fact the the candy was the rock hard type I probably just did. After feeling the actual impact I realized using the meager table as a shield was a foolish plan, it will most likely break apart from the first hit. </p><p><i>'Not like it matters though, I can't move anywhere with my leg stuck to the floor.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Doesn't mean we can't bring things towards us.'</span> I thought about using my spells to bring the machine in range but I could easily tip it over by accident  and endanger the kids. So far they were safe behind the machine and it’s best to keep it that way. With some quick thinking I cast two magnetic spells on the side of two shelves in front of me, each with a different polarity. With a loud crash they collided in front of me acting as a makeshift wall against the onslaught, it would't hold long but it's better than nothing. </p><p><i>'Ok so what are my options here?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Not much considering we can't move. Though we could always lob a fireball at it.'</span></p><p><i>'Definitely not! I'm not risking their safety! I'll just have to work from here.'</i> From what I could tell the machine was roughly seven metres away. <i>'Two meters, I'm </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">NOT</span><i> going to be bested by two meters!'</i></p><p>I closed my eyes and focused my mind activating my 'Sense'. Sure enough, I just couldn't 'feel' or 'see' the machine through the makeshift wall in front of me. But I kept at it, diving deeper and deeper into my mind ignoring all other distractions around me. Every other sound and sensation became a shadow somewhere in the back of my mind, I put all my focus imagining the machine in the distance, the sound it makes, the rumbles and vibrations. </p><p>Ever so slowly I began to feel a familiar sensation of 'weight', it was agonizingly slow but I kept my cool and patiently waited, continuing to focus until eventually I could 'feel' the magic emanating from the machine. Using my 'Sight' I could 'see' the spells wrapping around the machine almost creating an outline of the machine in the darkness. Part of the machine itself was glowing brightly like a florescent light indicating that those were the enchanted ones. However one particular 'fire' was burning much brighter than any spell or enchanted object. This 'fire' felt different than the rest, its size was much smaller than the spells around it but the 'weight' of the magic felt much heavier than anything else. </p><p><i>'It's the fuel source,'</i> I concluded. <i>'What did Twilight call it? A battery gem?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Who cares what its called! When are we actually going to drain the damn thing?!'</span> Just then I could hear something big and heavy hit my makeshift wall hard nearly startling me out of my focus, but thankfully I was able to keep my cool. </p><p><i>'Right.'</i> I was just about ready to drain the battery gem expecting it would shut it down much like unplugging an electric machinery but hesitated in the last moment. Seeing as I'm actually dealing with magic in a world that consistently fucks up every natural law I used to know, it's probably best to err on the side of caution. </p><p>So instead of draining from a single source like I've always done before, I concentrated my focus on an area around the machine to include very source of magic I could 'feel'. It was all purely experimental and in the event of failure I could simply drain the battery gem as planned before. This was simply a safer alternative since I knew nothing about the spells placed upon the machine. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I vote no on this! We could easily drain too much magic and fry our brains again!'</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I can't just drain the thing carelessly, for all I know the spells could retain enough magic to go haywire and harm the kids. I'm doing this!'</span><span style="color:#6495ED"> I reached out with my mind and 'touched' every spell and enchantment along with the battery gem, intent on draining every one of them empty in a single swoop.  </span></p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">The sensation was, in a word, overpowering. It felt like a tidal wave was crashing down and funneling inside me, like sucking in an entire storm into my lungs and never needing to expel it out. Much as I would have liked the experience to last longer, it only took a fraction of a second for me to drain it all completely. I could no longer 'feel' or 'see' any magic from the machine in my mind. Suddenly my mind was assaulted by a small throb of pain which quickly grew and intensified, I clenched my teeth and braced myself for the incoming pain. However just as quickly as it grew the pain started to level off and soon it became something comparable to a hangover after a night of heavy drinking. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'At least it wasn't like before, I guess Twilight was right. Battery gems pale in comparison with arcane gems.'</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I still think that was a stupid thing to do, what happened if we were wrong and end up splitting our heads open again? That was unnecessary risk.'</span></p><p><i>'Wrong, it was entirely necessary.'</i> After what felt like forever I finally opened my eyes again only to squint as the light stung my eyes. After a few seconds to let my eyes adjust to the brightness again I picked myself up from the floor while keeping my left leg firmly planted on the floor, not like I had much choice in the matter. </p><p>&quot;Girls can you hear me?&quot; I shouted over the shelves in front of me. &quot;It's safe to come out now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney? Where are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Over here Sweets, behind the shelves. I can't move my leg is stuck. Is Applebloom and Scootaloo with you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah we're here.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Ah'm here too, we're fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aright, you three stay where you are, I don't want you walking around the place with all the mess. Let me sort things out and I'll come get you ok?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good girls.&quot; By now the ponies that were stuck hiding in the store started to come out of their respective shelters as they heard my conversation with the fillies. &quot;Alright is anyone injured or need any help? If not, please calmly leave the store and inform everyone outside to not panic. Everything's been taken care of here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm, could somepony please get me down?&quot; Begged the pony dangling on the roof.</p><p>&quot;As soon as we can, just hang on a minute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh ha ha, very funny.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, that sorta slipped out. Bon Bon you there?&quot; I yelled to towards the counter. Her head poked out from behind the counter, looking about nervously at the machine. &quot;It's off Bon Bon don't worry. Do you happen to have anything that can remove this gunk of me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-yes I do, I use some special soap that can easily dissolve sugar in the bathroom. Let me just go get it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You do that while I try to move the stuff around the room and clear a path.&quot; I began using my spells to levitate debris and pile them up to the sides, starting with the largest ones like shelves and furniture since it'll take more magic to move and I need to rid myself of excess magic. I sped things up a bit by using less control and finesse as I tried to waste as much magic as possible with each spell, using roughly twice as much magic necessary. Fortunately everyone except for the stallion on the ceiling had left the store so it was relatively easy to calm him down and explain why stuff were burning around him, which didn’t take long seeing as he just wants to get this day over with.</p><p>By the time Bon Bon came back most of the shelves and furniture were cleared away giving a reasonably clear path from one end of the room to the other. There were a few that were stuck in place covered in the same sugary gunk that I was, while others were just broken to smaller pieces which I piled up in one corner. Bon Bon was trotting towards me carrying a small bucket of steaming water, which was bubbling with suds, in her mouth.</p><p>She placed the bucket down next to me, &quot;This should only take a second.&quot; She tilted the bucket over just a bit to drench my leg with the cleaning solution which almost instantly melted the glob of sugar way. It even cleaned out some of the dirt and grime on my pants. Once I was free I used my magic to levitate some of the water, which was real tricky, and threw it to the stallion like a water balloon. He was clearly frightened being covered in flames but didn't struggle or cause any problems as I levitated him down to the floor. </p><p>At first I thought he was an earth pony but once he was cleaned up I saw a pair of folded wings start to form as the sugar dissolved. <i>'I guess that explains how he got up there, probably got hit while flying to the door.'</i></p><p>&quot;Uhm...thanks for the help.&quot; </p><p>&quot;No problem.&quot; He turned around and trotted off towards the door, only to pause and look back at me.</p><p>&quot;You're alright in my book monkey. Come by the bar and I'll treat ya to a drink.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<span style="font-size:1.25em">I'm not a</span>-wait, by <i>drink</i> you meant alcoholic beverages right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh course, what's the point of going to bar if you ain't getting drunk? There's only one bar in town so just ask around.&quot; With that he trotted out the store with leaving me stunned.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.25em">'WE GOT BEER PEOPLE!!'</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED;font-size:1.25em">'OH SHIT JUST GOT REAL!!'</span> After promising to myself to definitely take him up on that offer I made my way to the girls who, surprisingly, waited exactly as I told them to. Probably because they knew they were in serious trouble. </p><p>&quot;Now then,&quot; I gazed at them with a small frown with my hands folded across my chest.</p><p>&quot;We're sorry,&quot; they spoke in unison, their ears were folded flat on their heads nervously. </p><p>&quot;We just wanted to make yeh somethin' nice,&quot; Applebloom was drawing circles on the floor.</p><p>&quot;But it didn't quite turn out the way we wanted,&quot; Sweetie Belle avoided looking at me and kept her gaze downward.</p><p>&quot;Like always,&quot; added Scootaloo dejectedly. </p><p>Much to my surprise I wasn't at all angry at them, a bit frustrated maybe, but knowing everything was unintentional I couldn't find it in me to resent them or anything. A handful maybe but they were kids after all and I've dealt with worse human kids before. </p><p>&quot;Well, seeing as it was all for me I guess I can let it pass,&quot; they each let out a long sigh of relief at the news. &quot;However,&quot; their ears perked back up at attention, &quot;that's not to say you won't go unpunished. I'll have to inform Rarity and Applejack about all this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aaaaaww!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Don't <i>aaaaww</i> me, now go apologize to Bon Bon.&quot; I raised a hand towards the cream-colored mare. </p><p>&quot;We're sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright kids, the important thing is nopony was seriously hurt.&quot; Much like myself, Bon Bon can't seem to find the heart to be angry with them as well. </p><p>&quot;I'll drop by sometime tomorrow and help clean up the mess.&quot; I offered.</p><p>&quot;Oh no that won't be necessary, my roommate's a unicorn remember? We'll manage on our own, it'll only take a day to clean and fix everything.&quot; Looking around I had my doubts two ponies could sort through the entire mess in a single day, but then again they have magic to speed things up. </p><p>&quot;Are you sure? I would really like a chance to make up for everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure, you've done more than enough by saving everypony <i>and</i> keeping my candy maker intact. How did you do that by the way?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just a trick I know,&quot; I answered with a smile. &quot;Well then Miss Bon Bon-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please just Bon Bon.&quot; I nodded.</p><p>&quot;Well then Bon Bon, I had better get these kids back home. I think that's enough adventure for-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my stars! Sweetie Belle is that you?&quot; We all turned out heads towards the front doorway to see Rarity forcing her way past the spectators out front before galloping inside with her floating shopping bags following behind. </p><p>&quot;Easy Rarity, everything's fine and nobody was hurt.&quot; I tried my best to calm her down but she wasn't listening and kept galloping towards us trampling over sugary treats. </p><p>She skidded to a halt right next to Sweetie Belle and began poking her muzzle and hoof in order to better inspect the filly. &quot;Rarity stop, I'm fine!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney what happened here!?&quot; Shouted Rarity while still fussing over her younger sister. &quot;I trusted you with-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's not his fault Rarity! He saved us!&quot; It took some time to calm Rarity down and even longer to explain the whole situation, but with Bon Bon's help she eventually settled down. After several apologies from Rarity to Bon Bon, and one to me for jumping to conclusions, the five of us left the store, leaving Bon Bon to start cleaning up the mess we made. Rarity and I did offer our aid but she held firm and even threatened to kick us out if we didn't listen. </p><p>As we exited the store the sun was already starting to set casting an orange blanket across the sky, clearly the day passed by much quicker than I realize. The fillies had returned back to their energetic self running around to the side of the street in order to peek inside the many stores while Rarity and I walked in the middle of the street. Seeing as the day was over we decided it was best to simply take the fillies home which I wholeheartedly agreed to. I was brimming with energy a few minutes ago but that was mostly due to the adrenaline and it was already starting to wane off, I was starting to drag my legs around more rather than walking. The plan was for Rarity and Sweetie Belle to head on home while I take escort Applebloom back to the farm.</p><p>&quot;I could take Scootaloo along with me.&quot; I offered while gazing at the orange filly running around with the other two in the distance, darting back and forth between store windows. </p><p>&quot;That won't be necessary dear I can take her home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it's alright, I've been wanting to meet her pa-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney.&quot; she cut in with a sharp tone. &quot;I <i>insist.</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh...kay?&quot; Before I could question why she was so determined she picked up her pace and trotted ahead of me towards the fillies. </p><p>&quot;Girls! It's time to go home!&quot; Rarity shouted.</p><p>&quot;But we haven't shown Rodney all of Ponyville, how are we suppose to get our cutie-marks in tourism if we can't even-&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's always tomorrow Scoots,&quot; I cut in before the Applebloom and Sweetie Belle could voice their agreement. &quot;Just because you didn't get to show me everything doesn't mean any of you are bad tour guides. Most importantly I had fun.&quot; I paused, &quot;Well, mostly.&quot;</p><p>We continue to make our way up the street while the fillies recounted the events of the day exaggeratedly to Rarity which, of course, I never corrected. Once the road split of we separated with Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo and Rarity heading of one road while Applebloom and I went down the other. Rarity's unusually strong insistent with Scootaloo earlier on still stuck to my mind, however eventually my exhaustion and Applebloom's never ending energy easily made me forget. Luckily Hoofpoint was already near the edge of the town so it shouldn't take much time to reach Sweet Apple Acres. </p><p><i>'Hopefully dinner will be ready by the time I get back.'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[That night, in Canterlot Castle.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Excuse me your Highness,&quot; spoke one of the guards outside of Celestia's personal quarters. &quot;Sorry to bother you but there's somepony here that kept insisting to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;By sun's grace Celestia, it's me!&quot; Shouted a deep strong voice. Inside Celestia smiled as she recognized the voice, though it really didn't matter if she did, only one pony alive had enough gall to address her like that and get away with it. </p><p>&quot;It's quite alright my little ponies, you can let him in.&quot; Slowly the large double doors slid open revealing a grizzled old gray unicorn stallion with a lighter shade of gray for his mane and tail. By appearance alone anypony would assume he was just another aged unicorn with a messy mane, but with closer inspection they would notice the hard thick muscles underneath his coat that could challenge the healthiest earth pony. His most noticeable feature was, without a doubt, the long ghostly white horn sticking out of his mane. It wasn't anywhere near the same length as an alicorn's horn but it was a good three inch longer than the average unicorn. The contrast of color between his horn and coat created an illusion of his horn glowing like a beacon. But to Celestia she found his eyes to strike out the most, unlike other ponies of his age she could still see the fire of youth still burning strong in his eyes along with the occasional mischievous glint every now and then. His cutie-mark was an old tome with a unicorn silhouette painted on the front and the entire book was wrapped tight in bindings hiding arcane secrets within.</p><p>As usual, he had an irritated look etch across his face, much to Celestia personal amusement. She couldn't quite remember the last time he wasn't irritated by something. &quot;Come in Inquest, it's always good to see you. How have you been?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Getting older by the second obviously,&quot; Inquest trotted inside, completely ignoring the scowls of the guards. He knew many members of the guards disliked him for his carefree attitude towards the princess. &quot;Unlike somepony I know, you look exactly the same when I was a sniveling colt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah yes, you were so adorable back then.&quot; The memory made Celestia laugh lightly while as Inquest simply rolled his eyes. &quot;So what can I help you with Inquest? And please don't say you need more lab equipment replaced.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That whole incident was never my fault, had the carpet been made to my specification it would have flown perfectly!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Instead it went on a rampage and destroyed more than half of the laboratory.&quot; replied Celestia flatly. &quot;But let's not dwell on past mistakes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, I came here because I have something to discuss about our visitor.&quot; The stallion trotted towards a nearby table and helped himself to a cup of tea. </p><p>&quot;You actually took time off from your research?&quot; asked Celestia teasingly.</p><p>&quot;Well it's not like we get a case like this everyday now do we?&quot; He answered before levitating the cup to his lip and drinking a mouthful. &quot;I read the reports from the team you sent to investigation the site of his....<i>entry.</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did they make some mistake?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not really, they did everything right. Everypony followed exact precise steps straight from the textbook.&quot; He took another sip before continuing. &quot;And that's problem. Nothing like this ever happened before so everything they did was the wrong approach.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me guess, you went ahead and did your own investigation. Alone. In the middle of the Everfree.&quot; Now it was Celestia's turn to look irritated.</p><p>&quot;Come now Celestia I can take care of myself, you know where I've been and done. It'll take more than the Everfree to get me.&quot; Inquest refilled his cup before making his way to sit comfortably in a large pillow across from Celestia. &quot;But let’s not argue where and when I choose to go, you won't win.&quot; Celestia merely shook her head with a small smile. &quot;So yes I did travel to the site and did my own set of experiments and investigation, unsurprisingly I discovered something your team missed.&quot; There was a small hint of smugness in his voice.</p><p>&quot;Did you manage to find a way to send him back?&quot; Celestia asked with great interest.</p><p>&quot;Sorry but no, whatever created the rift in our world and his is long gone and there's barely anything left. Face it Celestia, he’s here to stay.&quot; He took another sip of tea before continuing. &quot;No, what I discovered was small traces of magical residue in the area around the site. It's like a ripple or an echo of the phenomena that brought him here and even that took a great deal of effort to detect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it not possible to mimic the phenomena from that echo?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Impossible, it's too weak to learn anything in time. By the rate at which it’s dissipating I calculate it’ll be gone in one or two days.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm getting there.&quot; Celestia huffed out a breath in irritation which made Inquest crack the tiniest smile as he drank another sip of tea. &quot;The reason I was able to detect the echo in the first place was simply because it stood out and felt so different from everything else, and I mean <i>everything</i>. In all my life nothing I've seen, heard, or read about even comes close to how....<i>alien</i> it felt. Its very nature was almost a complete opposite of Equestria, probably this entire dimension. Thus I theorize that this echo came from the other side of the rift, most likely the world he came from.&quot; He leaned in closer to Celestia with a serious gaze, &quot;The thing is, I discovered another echo alongside it.&quot; Inquest paused letting his words sink in. </p><p>&quot;What do you mean another echo? Does that mean there's another human somewhere out there!?&quot; Celestia was now feeling very worried. A single human, and an unconscious one at that, caused so much chaos and panic across Equestria by simply existing.</p><p>&quot;No.&quot; Celestia let out a sigh in relief but it didn't last long. &quot;The second echo was just as alien as the first, however they were vastly different from each other.&quot; Inquest paused again before continuing in a grave tone, &quot;Something <i>else</i> came through.&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN: 	Finally it's done! I don't know that came over me to write something this big! I'm so sorry it took so long to finish, if you're not aware I'm back in college so I don't have much time to write. </p><p>Now some of you may not know but there has been a few inconsistencies in previous chapters so I've done some revisions and changes.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 24 - I got close to her goods and lived to tell about it.<br/>Edited by Noxxels</p><hr/><p>Much to my relief the days that followed were calm enough that I’ve settled into a comfortable rhythm. I spent most of them either with Rarity at the boutique though I would save one day of the week with Twilight for our weekly training session. Rarity and I did drop by Bon Bon’s store the day after the incident but looking at how clean and refurbished it was, she clearly didn’t need any of our help. Thankfully the steady pace did a lot of good for my back, most of the cuts have healed up except for a few severe ones that will still take awhile to heal. The nurse from the hospital came by once to remove some of the strings she used to stitch me up and to observe my overall condition for the hospital records, I guess since I’ll be living it’ll be wise to let them have as much information of my biology as possible.  </p><p>Most of my everyday routine with Rarity revolved around helping with the shop. Typically, I would help collect supplies from various stores or help her create some new ensembles, although it was mostly simple tasks with my hands. To my surprise she even let me handle the sales from time to time, I wasn’t sure if it was because she liked to show me off to her customers or if she wanted to help introduce me to new ponies. Whatever her intentions were, it did help me ease into town a bit by keeping myself constantly interacting with the townsfolk. So far, none of them have run out the store screaming, so I guess I’m doing something right.</p><p>For today my job entailed several minimal tasks that were more like chores, simple one but still quite laborious however I didn’t argue against any of it. She is after all my current provider and I can’t repay her by being picky. It actually helped pass the time by having to focus from one task to another and so far my back wasn’t giving me much hassle.</p><p>“Kay, that’s the last one,” I carefully placed the last empty trash bin on the kitchen floor. “Need anything else boss?” I asked while making my way to wash my hands in the sink.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>“I’ll talk classy around customers but I am <i>not</i> keeping it up all day for your entertainment.” Unfortunately, someone had tipped Rarity off about my suave manner of speech and ever since then she kept insisting I use it whenever customers were around the shop. Now it seems she can’t get enough of it.</p><p>“We both know you can if you want to dear and it’s not hurting anypony.”</p><p>“Except for me,” I answered flatly, “feels like I died a little inside.” Rarity rolled her eyes irritably. “So anything else?” I asked again.</p><p>“Nothing for today at least. I plan on closing the shop and working on all my projects. Since Sweetie Belle is having a sleepover at Sweet Apple Acres, I plan to take advantage of the peace and quiet to finish several ensembles.” She sniffed the air around me as I approached her. “Perhaps a bath is in order,” she continued while placing a hoof to cover her muzzle, “or two.”</p><p>“Well if there’s nothing else I’ll be out for the day, will that be alright with you?”</p><p>“That would be fine dear, I actually prefer to be alone during my inspirational moments.”</p><p>With that we both exited the kitchen and went up the stairs. Rarity headed into her study while I made my way to my room for a fresh set of clothes before entering the bathroom. Unlike Twilight, Rarity spent a great deal of effort and money furnishing her bathroom to rival that of Canterlot Castle, although her choice of decor included much more lace and ribbons. She had a reasonably large bathtub-shower hybrid with a variety of accessories laid about like scented candles, high class shampoo and even bath salts as far as I can tell.</p><p>Luckily, I was wise enough to question Rarity about her collection of soap and shampoo. I had discovered she owned the exact same unscented soap that I had used back at the castle, the one that amplified my pheromones. Not only that, but she also has three other different types from the same brand, an ointment, a perfume, and even a toothpaste. I’m not sure how that last one would affect me, and if I had my way, no one will.</p><p>After a thorough shower I made my way to Rarity’s study and knocked gently on the door, “I’m about to head out, you sure you don’t need anything?”</p><p>“Quite sure dear and thank you for making sure,” she answered without looking back completely focused on her task.</p><p>“Alright then, could you leave my dinner out for me? Just in case I’m late coming back,” I turned around and closed the door behind me.</p><p>“Very well, I’ll see you-oh! Rodney wait!” I opened the door and poked my head in to see Rarity had moved to one side of the room and was rummaging through a chest. With her horn glowing, she lifted a small pouch that jingled in the air as it floated towards me. Instead of grabbing the pouch and risk touching Rarity’s magic, I held out my hand and waited patiently as Rarity dropped the poach into my open palm. Based on its weight and the jingling sound I had my suspicion, which proved true as I undid the strap and peered inside.</p><p>I knew she mentioned a salary once, but now that I was holding it in my hand it felt wrong taking it considering everything else. “Rarity I can’t take-”</p><p>“Ah tut tut tut, I’ll hear nothing of it Rodney. Yes, you owe me some compensation for the damages,” she spoke in a tired tone, “but anypony who works for me will have a salary. There will be no argument about this, <i>especially</i> when we both know I’ll win in the end.” She ended with a teasing tone in her voice.</p><p>I looked back to the pouch and let out a sigh of defeat, “Since you feel so strongly about this I guess I can’t say no.”</p><p>“No you can’t,” she replied with that same smugness, “and if it makes you feel any better I’ll simply cut your salary to pay for the damages.”</p><p>I chuckled and shook my head, “Yes that does make things easier. Thank you Rarity, you’re-.”</p><p>“Yes, yes I know,” she trotted back towards the ponyquin in the center of the room with a prideful smile on her face. “Now if you would be so kind....”</p><p>With the pouch in one hand I left the study and made my way downstairs. Seeing as the pouch was too large to fit in my pocket I grabbed a nearby string with a needle and used it to stitch the pouch to the right side of my pants. I’ve seen Rarity’s technique so it wasn’t like I was going at it completely blind, the end result was shoddy and wasn’t anything to be proud of but it did its job. With nothing else holding me back I exited the boutique with the pouch jingling in rhythm of my pace. Gazing up to the sky I noticed the sun had begun its descent, which didn’t really leave me much time till dusk.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So are we still heading off to Fluttershy’s?’</span></p><p><i>‘Far as everybody knows Fluttershy’s the only one that actually keeps meat around.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Not that. We’ve got some money now so why not hit the bar?’</span></p><p><i>‘That’s....tempting, but it’s way too early in the day to get wasted, plus I’ve held this off for too long to a point I’ve started dreaming of burgers and t-bone steaks. You wouldn’t have anything to do with that now would you?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘No idea what you’re talking about.’</span></p><p><i>‘Ahuh, sure you don’t.’</i></p><p>Although I’ve only ever been to Fluttershy’s cabin once before, I was confident I could rely on my memory to guide the way. Since I’ve explored around some with the crusaders, I’ve seen enough to get a good layout of the town, so I can easily find my way back if I ever got lost. I also knew that my time with them had aided my reputation around town but I never knew how much, till now. Along the way several ponies would greet or holler out at me in a friendly manner with some actually walking up to shake and introduce themselves.</p><p>“Good afternoon,” greeted one earth pony.</p><p>“And to you too.”</p><p>“Hey I heard what you did at the candy shop, nice work!” Shouted one pegasus.</p><p>“It was nothing.”</p><p>“Come by my fruit cart sometimes, I’ll order in some bananas for you!” Offered another earth mare.</p><p>“Eh why not,” I replied with a shrug.</p><p>Although most were strangers, I met a few familiar faces along the way as well. I spotted Rose Luck, Daisy and Lily enjoying themselves in what looked like a restaurant or cafe some distance away. It was only when I got somewhat close did they notice me and started waving their hooves as I pass them by. I waved them back with a smile, which took on a more mischievous curve as I started wiggling my fingers, much like when we first met. Rose Luck and Lily froze with both their hooves in the air as their faces suddenly glowed bright red in embarrassment. Unfortunately for Daisy, she was right in the middle of drinking her beverage and whatever thought crossed her mind caused her to spew it over the other two mares. I picked up my pace and walked away with a big stupid grin just as the three mares started to create a commotion.</p><p>Soon the buildings started to thin out and the street became dirt instead of stone which meant I was quite close to the edge of town, a good indication I was going in the right direction. Eventually the buildings disappeared altogether, trees and other manner of bushes and plants taking their place. Once I saw a bridge going over a small river I knew I was on the right path and only had to stick to it to reach the cottage. Unfortunately, it still took some time to reach it, considering the distance. By the time the cottage came into view the day was already beginning to lose what little daylight it had left.</p><p>Most of the little animals that Fluttershy had already turned in for the day back to their burrows or small shelters. Remembering how timid and easily frightened Fluttershy was, I gently knocked on the her front door, which was more like tapping than actually knocking. Surprisingly, I heard someone descend the stairs and approach the door. How she was able to hear me knocking from the second level was beyond me.</p><p>“Is-is somepony out there?”</p><p>“It’s me Flutters.”</p><p>“Rodney?”</p><p>“The one and only.” Slowly the door creaked open, revealing a large teal-green colored eye.</p><p>“Oh, hello Rodney,” she greeted in a soft gentle voice. She pushed the door wide open bathing me in light and took a sidestep to let me in. “Uhm...it’s quite late, not that I mind of course. You’re welcome anytime.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Flutters I won’t be long.” I stepped inside her house and waited for her to close the door. “I’m here because Twilight mentioned you might be the only one in Ponyville to have what I need.” Fluttershy went over to her couch and beckoned me to sit with her hoof, which I gladly accepted before she took a seat on the other side.</p><p>“Oh...I hope so. It’d be a shame for you to come by for nothing, unless you just want to visit of course. I mean....if you want to.” She suddenly started frowning with her ears falling flat on her head as she stared to the floor. “I understand if you don’t want to after the last time.”</p><p>“Come now Fluttershy I’m not going to avoid you just because of that.” I reached out and patted her on the head gently hoping to comfort her. “I’ll be happy to come by and visit anytime you want me to. There’s no way I can stay away from such a pretty mare like you for long,” I teased in a cheery tune. She flushed bright red in embarrassment and tried desperately to hide it behind her hooves.</p><p>“I’m not that pretty,” she replied in softest voice I’ve ever heard.</p><p>“And adorable too, but I suppose that’s enough flattery for an evening.” With a last pat on her head I pulled back my hand let myself get comfortable on the couch, with modesty of course. “Now before I ask, I need you to stay calm ok?”</p><p>“You want to know if I have some meat to spare.”</p><p>“Yes,” I replied with a confused look. “How did you know?”</p><p>“Just uhm, promise you won’t get mad.” I might not have known the pegasus for long, but so far she hasn’t done anything to make me suspicious of her, quite the contrary even. Once I gave her a nod she got off the couch and trotted over towards a small table tucked perfectly in the corner. Turning around I saw she was now biting down on the edge of a scroll which bobbed up and down as she brought to me.</p><p>“What’s this about?” I asked just as I took the scroll from her. She took several nervous steps away from me without answering, so I just unfurled the scroll and began reading. Almost immediately I recognized the moon crescent symbol printed atop the parchment belonging to none other than the bane of my balls. Ignoring the sudden tingling sensation emanating from groin, I began reading.</p><hr/><blockquote><p><i>	To Fluttershy of Ponyville,</i></p><p><i>Bearer to the Element of Kindness,</i></p><p><i>Foremost, we hope that this letter finds thee well, dear Fluttershy, it has been sometime since our last meeting. We would also like to apologize the abruptness of this letter, “out of the blue” as thou would now call it.</i></p><p><i>As thou art aware by now there is a new resident living in Ponyville, a human by the name of Rodney (quite an interesting name yes?). Although we originally had our concerns, thou may be at ease. Both my sister and I believe he is of no threat to anypony, a hoof-full at most.</i></p><p><i>But now to the matter at hoof. It has come to our knowledge that thou art Ponyville’s animal caretaker. If we are correct in our assumptions, thou have experience dealing with several carnivorous animals. If this is true, then logically, thou should have a supply of meat in hoof in case one such creature requires your aid.</i></p><p><i>Thou may not be aware of this yet, and I beg you to remain calm, however Rodney consumes meat as well, quite enjoyably if his words are to be taken seriously. To be more precise he is an omnivore so a diet much like our own should suffice him for some time, in other words his need for meat is purely to indulge himself.</i></p><p><i>One that thou must not to grant. </i></p></blockquote><hr/><p>“WHAT!?” I shouted with a mixture of confusion and anger, causing Fluttershy to squeal and dive under a table. I cursed under my breath and went over to kneel and peek under the table where she was shivering in fright while hiding her face under both her hooves. I was about to coax her out, when something hit me behind the head. Turning around I see Angel thumping on the floor with his paws crossed over his chest and a pile of carrots in front of him, offering plenty more ammunition.</p><p>“I know, I know.” Apparently even the pets in this world have far more intelligence than those back home, especially considering I just understood what Angel was thinking by facial expression alone. Turning back to look under the table I tried my best to calm the pegasus down with a calm voice, “I’m sorry about shouting like that Fluttershy, I was just a bit surprised is all. Could you please come out? I promise not to shout again.”</p><p>Slowly her shivering ceased and she gently peaked through her hooves to see me smiling gently at her. Once she eventually came out, Angel jumped on her back and climbed up her head to keep an eye on me. I gave him a mocking pat on his head which irritated him greatly before picking up where I left off.</p><hr/><blockquote><p><i>Thou will not receive any repercussion or punishment if thou have already done so, however we ask that thou immediately desist. The reason behind our request are of private matters between him and I, it is merely a simple punishment for his past actions here in the castle. If however he becomes problematic, simply pass this letter unto him.</i></p><br/><br/><br/><p><i>To Rodney,</i></p><p><i>Now listen here you immature uncouth monkey! Do not even assume that just because thou art beyond my physical reach that thou can escape my wrath. For thy ‘assault’ upon us we have deemed to extend thy punishment </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">INDEFINITELY!</span></p><p><i>Do not fret thyself, we are aware that meat is a necessary part of thy diet. But we both know that is far, FAR into the future. Only until we see thee lying on a hospital bed suffering from a symptom of malnourishment will we consider giving what thou desire most.</i></p><p><i>If thou wishes to be free of this, thou must convince us with action. Keep in mind what I asked of thee before and remember why thou have moved to Ponyville.</i></p><br/><p><i>Princess Luna,</i></p><p><i>Reagent of the Moon</i></p></blockquote><hr/><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Told you not to slap that ass.’</span></p><p><i>‘Oh please she’s only pissed because I got close to her goods and lived to tell about it.’</i></p><p>“Rodney? Are you.....”</p><p>“It’s alright Flutters I’m not angry, just a bit irritated,” I replied calmly without frightening her.</p><p>“I’m so sorry but I really-”</p><p>“There’s no need for you to apologize. It’s not like I can ask you go behind Luna’s back now can I?” Despite what I said, there was still a lingering hope that somehow this timid mare would find the sudden bravery to do just that.</p><p>“Oh please don’t, I-I don’t think I can.....oh.” Even the way she seemed to break down in the end gave me heartache.</p><p>“Don’t worry Flutters, I’m not going to force you to choose sides,” I paused with a heavy sigh. “I’ll concede to Luna’s wishes for now.”</p><p>“That’s very kind of you Rodney,” she looked up to me with a smile only to look away a moment later as she started struggling to say something. “W-would you, uh, like to stay for dinner? If you want to of course, I’m sure you’re probably um, busy with eh, something but...if you want.”</p><p>“I’d love to Flutters, but not tonight. Maybe next time.”</p><p>“Oh......I see,” Fluttershy’s head dropped down in disappointment.</p><p>“Now don’t go looking like that. I promise to drop by more often, ok?”</p><p>“Pinkie promise?”</p><p>“I....what?”</p><p>“Do you Pinkie promise?” she asked again a bit more loudly.</p><p>“Ooooookay.” With a confused look, I reached out with my right hand as a fist with my pinkie sticking out, not quite sure how she’ll respond without the correct number of fingers.</p><p>“Wh-what are you doing?” she asked with a confused look that rivaled my own.</p><p>“A pinkie promise?”</p><p>“That’s not how you do it,” she said in a giggle. “Here I’ll show you.” She took a step back and started doing several gestures while singing what sounded like this world’s version of Cross my Heart. “Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my-ow!” I flinched when she actually poked her own right eye with a hoof. “Oh, why do I always do that?”</p><p>“I think I get it,” I said with a light laugh before copying her exact words and gestures, except for that last bit. “Happy?”</p><p>“Yes,” she answered along with a giggle. We exchanged several more pleasant words before I excused myself and bid Fluttershy goodnight.</p><p>“Oh...my, it’s so...dark outside,” she shivered more from fear than the cold as she stared down the dark dirt path from the doorway. “Are you sure you’ll be alright? What if you get lost?” She asked full of concern. Instead of answering, I picked up a reasonably sized rock with a levitation spell from her front yard that, thanks to the nature of my magic, illuminated the area around it like a old lantern.</p><p>“I’ll be fine as long as I stick to the road. But before I go you wouldn’t happen to know where I can find the bar? I was told there was one in Ponyville.”</p><p>“You passed it actually, it’s the first building on your left once you reach the town. The entrance is over around the back, I think, in the alleyway.”</p><p>“You make it sound like you’re a regular there,” I teased.</p><p>“Oh no, I don’t drink that much. Just...well, sometimes Rainbow would ask me to come along so-”</p><p>“I’m just teasing you Flutters, you don’t have to be so embarrassed. Why would they have the entrance out in the back though?”</p><p>“Well, it’s kind of like the town’s little dirty secret. Most ponies don’t even know it’s there.”</p><p><i>‘A quiet place to get drunk? Sign me up!’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Plus if you do something stupid it won’t spread around town.’</span></p><p>“Well I guess that’s it then, I’ll see you next time Fluttershy.” With that I descended down the porch as Fluttershy closed the door behind her. Just before I got past her front gate something hit the back of my head. Knowing what hit me and who threw it, I decided to screw with the little guy a bit.</p><p>They say animals can instinctively sense a predator and are able to detect the intent of bloodlust. These instincts are especially strong in an animal like a rabbit, whose only defense is to flee. With my back still facing the cottage, I tried my best to collectively pool in all my frustration and desire to eat meat again. With a deep breath I turned around to face Angel, who was sitting by an open window in the kitchen with a smug look on his face. Once our eyes locked, I started picturing all the possible ways I could cut him up and cook him, turn his little legs into miniature fried drumsticks or maybe just chop him up to little pieces and make rabbit soup. On and on the images of every kind of rabbit dish popped into my head, which soon became just about every meat dish I could remember feeding and strengthening my bloodlust.</p><p>It only took a second before that smug look became that of petrified fear as his eyes grew wide and his ears fell sideways. What pushed him over the edge was when I slowly smiled, flashed my fangs, and started licking my lips. With a small high pitched yelp he bolted back into the house knocking down everything in his path and causing complete chaos in the kitchen. I could hear Fluttershy screaming and trying to calm Angel down as I continued to make my way back to Ponyville.</p><p>I did feel somewhat guilty causing trouble for Fluttershy, but at least with this the little guy will have second thoughts before messing with me in the future. The trip back to Ponyville, however, wasn’t at all peaceful like before. My improvised lantern kept making the shadows of the trees dance about, creating illusions like something was lurking behind them, add the supernatural blue light it emanated kept putting me on guard. It comes to no surprise then that it took me less time to reach Ponyville than it did to Fluttershy’s cottage.</p><p>Once I was within the town border I took several deep breaths to collect myself before starting my search for the bar. I had hoped to ask a few ponies around, but as far as I could tell, the street was completely deserted. I probably should have expected this, since hardly anyone hung around the edge of town, much less after sunset. With no other choice, I began searching and combing the alleyways nearby for something that stood out from the rest, though considering how it was sort of a secret, it might just look like any plain door.</p><p>Luckily, that wasn't the case. By the third alleyway I spotted a relatively simple sign hanging over a flight of stairs that led down to, what looked like, the basement of the building it was attached to. The sign above was basically a picture of a foaming mug with a wing instead of a handle. <i> I’m willing to bet it’s an exact duplicate of that stallion’s mark.</i></p><p>As I approached the door at the base of the stairs, I could hear loud voices and chatter from behind the door. I tried knocking, but from the sheer volume of noise from the other side I doubted any of them could hear me. Seeing as there was no doorbell of any kind, I decided to test my luck and just strolled in like I was a regular. There were roughly three groups around the bar, each about four or five ponies happily chatting with each other. At least, they were before I stepped in. Like straight out of an old western movie, every single conversation immediately died down once everyone realized who, or what, just walked in.</p><p>“Sup,” I greeted the room in a casual tone.</p><p>“There you are! I’ve been wondering when you’d drop by.” I turned towards one side of the room where the stallion pegasus I saved at Bon Bon’s shop was attending the counter. His coat was a deep bronze color, much like the many beverages stacked up behind him, along with a bright blue mane and tail. His mark, on the other hand, was a more elaborate variation of the sign out front. Instead of a single wing, the mug had two wings in mid flight, as if flying across the sky.</p><p>“I’ve been busy, sort of,” I replied offhandedly.</p><p>“Well you’re here now. Grab a seat,” he gestured towards an empty seat in front of him for me to take. Although these chairs were much taller than what I’ve seen, they’re still far too short for me to use properly. The extra height seemed to be added mostly so that ponies could place their forehooves leisurely on the counter. As I walked towards the counter, my steps echoed through out the dead silence thickening the tension in the air. Thankfully, this did not go unnoticed.</p><p>“Now you all listen up! This here’s my guest, so I don’t want to hear any lip coming from any of you, ‘less you’d like to get banned from my establishment for life!” Considering this was the only bar in town, a life banishment pretty much meant getting hung out to dry. The entire bar exploded back into random chatter, as everyone now completely opted to ignore my existence.</p><p>“I like this place already,” I joked lightly. “Uh, sorry. I can’t seem to remember your name.”</p><p>“I reckon you wouldn’t on account we never introduced ourselves.” He held out a hoof over the counter. “Name’s Bronze Sky.”</p><p>“You can call me Rodney.” I reached and grabbed his hoof for a shake.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure Rodney and welcome to my bar, the Bronze Sky,” he shouted proudly, while waving a hoof in an arc over his head.</p><p>“You named it after yourself?”</p><p>“Why not?” he replied whimsically. “It’s a good name plus I’m lazy.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” I conceded with the same amount of humor. “No offense Bronze, but do you have anything taller for me to sit on?” I asked modestly.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess they would be too short, huh,” he commented as he eyed me up and down. “I think I’ve got a box or something that’ll work, if that’s alright with you.”</p><p>“Anything’s fine. Simpler is better right?”</p><p>“Ha! Precisely. I like the way you think.” With a hearty laugh he disappeared behind a nearby door giving me time to appreciate the bar.</p><p>It resembled a basement bar I used to visit back home, which gave a good homey feel, especially with all the polished wood. It was probably an unintentional effect, considering almost every building in the town was built with wood. Miscellaneous objects decorated the walls around from framed pictures of patrons to random knick knacks, some walls were scarce while others were completely filled from end to end.</p><p>But what stood out most was an impressive looking shield hanging in the center of the back wall, at least, it looked like one. It was longer than it was tall and looked more like a rectangular piece of metal, but it made sense considering it’s made for ponies. It was dented and damaged in several areas, but I could easily tell it was very well cared for. Aside from a scratches, it was polished to a point where it shone beautifully.</p><p><i>‘There’s definitely a story behind it.’</i></p><p>“Well, here you go. Hope this works.” Bronze Sky reappeared from a different side door, pushing along a reasonably sized wooden box with the top side of his head. I helped him pick the box, which wasn’t that hard since it was empty, and placed it on one corner of the counter. He threw me a clean piece of cloth that I used to cover the box, before taking a comfortable seat at one corner of the counter.</p><p>“You have no idea how long it’s been since I sat like this,” I commented with a relaxing sigh.</p><p>“I suppose they don’t make much of anything to accommodate somepony like you. So any preference to your vice?” He asked, after flying over the counter to take up his previous station. “First one’s on the house.”</p><p>“Depends,” I took out a few coins from my pouch, counting them carefully to get the right amount. I didn’t really want to get overboard, since I did promise Applejack I would spend half of it on her apples. And, I suppose, it would be wise to start saving some for a rainy day. “How many can I get for this?” I dropped roughly a quarter of it all on the counter.</p><p>“A few of the staple stuff, not enough to get drunk though. I’ll get you some apple cider, it might not be as flavorful as the Apple family’s, but it’s got a lot more kick to it.” Using his wings he took out a mug and placed it under a tap, where a golden brown brew started filling it up. Only once white foam started to spill over did he stop and offer it to me. “One hard apple cider. Enjoy.”</p><p><i>‘You know, in any other situation I would probably have questioned why these ponies have mugs with handles when they obviously lack the means to use them.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Then again, we’re stuck in a land of techno-colored ponies as the world’s only exploding human. So shut up and drink it already.’</span></p><p>With nothing else holding me back, I grabbed the mug, tilted my head back and took a swig of the stuff. Almost immediately, I had to fight the urge not to choke and spit it all out, as what felt like hot coal travelled down my throat.</p><p>“Holy crap that’s hard!” I wheezed between coughs.</p><p>“You ok there?” Bronze asked somewhat amused.</p><p>“Yeah, just got caught off guard.” I swallowed a few times to help alleviate the sensation. “Exactly how much alcohol is in this thing?” Take it from someone who once tried to take up brewing as a hobby, even if you distill instead of fermenting the brew it would still take a considerably insane amount of alcohol to make a drink like this.</p><p>“Oh about thirty to forty percent, I’d wager.” I stared at the mug in my hand for several seconds as the numbers sunk in.</p><p>“Uuh, from one to ten, how heavy is this drink in general?”</p><p>“I’d give it a five or six, I suppose. Personally it’s a three, but then again I live with the stuff.”</p><p>“Damn these ponies and their digestive tracts,” I mumbled under my breath.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Nothing just talking to myself,” I answered before taking a sip of my drink. “Hey Bronze, can you promise me something?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Punch me if you ever see me join a drinking contest. You’ll probably save my life.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several hours later, back in Carousel Boutique......]</p></div><p>Rarity kept staring at her cold cup of chocolate in front of her on the kitchen table in silence. She would occasionally gaze up to the clock hanging on the wall, let out a sigh and stare back at either her cup or the cold dinner across the table. For the past hour, the unicron had tried to keep herself calm, but her imagination had started to become wilder and less realistic the longer she waited.</p><p><i>‘What if he got lost? Or hurt even. Could somepony have ponynapped him!?’</i> There had been several moments where was about to leave and search the town for him, but everytime Rarity came close to the door, she would hesitate and question herself.</p><p><i>‘Calm down Rarity, he most likely lost track of time, is all. Afterall, it’s not proper for the lady to chase the stallion. Not that he’s a stallion, of course, but-wait. Why am I even thinking of him like that!?’</i> Such thoughts led to even more interesting ideas, which made things worse for the worry stricken mare. All those thoughts and worries instantly died out the moment she heard the ringing of a bell as her front door opened. With pent up anger, she trotted towards her front store, ready to give the human an ear full.</p><p>“Where have you been!? Do you have any idea how late it is!?” Despite her shouting, Rodney kept strolling inside without missing a beat, continuing to close the gap between him and Rarity. “Are you even listening to me!? Just what have you been-wah!” Out of nowhere Rodney suddenly bent over to wrap his hands around her and started carrying the unicorn in his arms much like how a gentleman should. “What is the meaning of this!? I demand you put me down this instant!”</p><p>“Calm yourself my lady, such anger will ruin your complexion,” he replied in a calm tone.</p><p>“My complexion is none of your business thank you very much and....wait, what is that sme-HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING!?”</p><p>“Now please Rarity, I-”</p><p>“All this time I’ve been sick of worry, while you-”</p><p>“Rarity, I...”</p><p>“were out there drinking in that disgraceful-Aah!” Suddenly, Rodney dropped the unicorn somewhat roughly on her large victorian couch. “How dare you-” Before Rarity could go into into another tirade, Rodney gently placed a finger over her lips.</p><p>“Yes, it was wrong of me to be out so late. Yes, I should have told you about my plans before I left. Yes, you have every right to be angry with me. This was is not something you deserve after all you’ve done for me, and that is what I want to talk to you about.” Rarity could easily tell how intoxicated the human was by his breath and unsteady steps, yet strangely it didn’t seem to affect his speech, quite the contrary in fact.</p><p>“You, my dear, have taken me in, clothed me, fed me and offered your home to me, despite what I have done.” Although Rarity had often heard him speak as a gentlecolt, seeing as she helped teach him, this was the first she heard it sound so natural and true. “And yet, I have done nothing to repay such generosity other than what is expected. So please, allow me to mend that mistake.” Rodney kneeled in front of the couch and gently grabbed Rarity’s right fore hoof. He immediately began kneading it with his fingers.</p><p>“What are youuoooOOH!” Rarity let out a loud moan as the sensation caught her completely off guard. Using his delicate, yet strong, fingers Rodney began massaging the muscles on her leg, doing everything he could to alleviate the tension. “Oh my, that’s-oh yes. Hmm, higher.” The human obeyed and began to systematically work his way up the limb, causing the mare to moan and hiss louder.</p><p>“I am not hurting you am I?” Rodney asked with concern.</p><p>“Don’t worry it-ah, it’s the good hurt,” she replied through heavy breathing as Rodney pressed down on another sore muscle. Rodney continued to massage the limb all the way up to Rarity’s shoulder, before moving on to her left fore hoof and repeating the process. This took even less time than the other now that he knew which areas to focus on. “That was amazing Rodney, thank you.”</p><p>“Do not thank me yet my dear, I have only just begun. If you could lay your head on the mattress I’ll show you what these finger can really do.” Rarity’s heart starting beating faster in anticipation, letting her head relax as she laid on her belly, allowing the human to roam freely across her back. “Let’s start here and move our way down.” He climbed on the couch to stand on his knees, positioning himself so that the unicorn lay between his legs. Reaching out, he wrapped his fingers around Rarity’s neck at the highest point and began to use his thumbs to massage in circles while being careful not to accidentally choke her.</p><p>“Oooohhh...,” Rarity moaned as she bit down on her mattress.</p><p>“I take it you enjoy this?” 	</p><p>“Less talking, more...whatever it is you’re doing. Ah, right there!” With a chuckle Rodney began pouring more effort to the task, removing every muscle knot he found. Soon, the only audible sound in the room was the heavy breathing of the mare and her occasional moans and words of bliss.</p><p><i>‘Lotus and Aloe may be experts but this is-OH CELESTIA!’</i> Rarity was completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of pain, followed by relief as Rodney undid a particularly stubborn knot near the base of her neck. The hours that Rarity spent working on her projects had made her body sore and tired, which made the entire experience so much more intense and satisfying. What made everything so surreal was how his fingers did what no hoof can ever do, it went places the unicorn didn’t even know about.</p><p>As Rodney slowly inched lower down her neck and onto her back, the feeling of relief started to mix with pleasure. A pleasure that made her breathing and moans louder the lower he went. Eventually, he had worked his way down her back and was now teetering closer to her flank. One part of Rarity’s mind was unsure whether she should let him proceed, while the other begged to discover how <i>intimate</i> those fingers could be. Rarity’s hesitation, however, allowed Rodney to make the decision for her. Without any hesitation, he grabbed both sides of her flank and began massaging them with the same meticulous focus as before.</p><p>“Rodney wait I’m not-oh hmm oh yesss,” whatever lingering doubts Rarity had were completely washed away as a wave of pure pleasure assaulted her. Without realizing, Rarity’s tail started swishing to the side as her body started heating up in anticipation. Luckily, she still had enough clarity not to fully reveal herself. By now, Rarity’s coat was already glistening in sweat and her perfectly groomed mane was now a mess, but none of that mattered to her at this moment. Rarity’s moans had escalated to screams as the heat in her nether region was slowly nearing its peak. But just before it reached boiling point the strength in Rodney's hands suddenly disappeared, denying Rarity the satisfaction she desperately craved.</p><p>“Rodney why-”</p><p>“ZZZZzzzzzZZZzz.....” Rarity stared at the human for several seconds, not quite sure how to comprehend the situation. Rodney was now leaning over the couch and snoring loudly as he resigned himself to an intoxicated slumber.</p><p>“You have got to be joking,” Rarity asked incredulously.</p><p>“zzzzZZZZZzzz....” </p><p>“You are the most insufferable! Foalish human that I’ve-”</p><p>“Uhh Fluttershy,” mumbled the human as he started sleep talking. Rarity’s eye began twitching violently as she considered murdering him and ending the human race in Equestria. White vapor rose from Rarity’s head as the sweat on her body started to evaporate out of pure rage.</p><p>“Humph!” huffed Rarity as she pushed Rodney’s hand’s away from her. “Males,” she said with disdain before climbing up the stairs with a cold shower in mind, leaving Rodney sleeping on the couch. </p><p>“Oh you make the best burgers ever Flutters.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/c143772e00b6268683bde68e0bf0ee6ca2d79c6c?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc07.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2012%2F282%2F9%2Ff%2Fachievement_unlocked___still_got_it_by_jtjandra-d5hcc1p.jpg" /></p></div><p>Update: Got another pic for the achievement.</p><br/><br/><p>So.......yeeeeaaaah.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 25 - The Star of Rodney<br/>Edited by Noxxels (a bit)</p><p>AN: Noxxels and I got swamped with work and life so we couldn’t put much time into editing this chap properly. Sorry if the quality is a bit subpar. </p><hr/><p>&quot;Rise and shine Rodney!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ngh!&quot; I gritted my teeth as I rolled over to the side.  &quot;Not so loud Rarity.&quot; My hangover intensified with her voice, her usual beautiful and elegant voice now sounded like breaking glass, crying babies and nails on a chalkboard altogether. &quot;Uuhh, can we open late today? It's not like-<span style="font-size:1.375em">AH!</span>&quot; I yelped and flinched in pain as Rarity used her magic to spread open one of the curtains in the shop letting the cursed sunshine in. The glare of the light made me shield my eyes with both hands as my headache punched directly at my brain with a bronze fist.</p><p>&quot;And miss such a wonderful day like this? I think not!&quot; For a moment there I could have sworn she was talking louder and in a higher pitch than before. Before I could ponder any further I noticed another nearby curtain was glowing with Rarity's spell.</p><p>&quot;Wait Rarity don't-<span style="font-size:1.375em">AH!</span>&quot; I flinched again as another curtain spread wide, bathing the store with more light. Much to my dismay and further pain, I accidentally lost balance and fell off the couch hitting the floor hard.  </p><p>&quot;I'm sorry, what was that dear?&quot; She asked innocently, horn glowing as her spell continued to jump from one curtain to another.</p><p>&quot;Please Rarity I-<span style="font-size:1.375em">AH!</span> Mercy, please mer-<span style="font-size:1.375em">ARGH!</span>&quot; My pleas fell on deaf ears as Rarity kept trotting around the store opening ever curtain along the way. By the time the last curtain opened I was curled up on the floor next to the couch, cradling my head with both arms trying desperately to block out the light.</p><p>&quot;Breakfast will be done soon. If you wish to partake with me then I suggest you quickly wash yourself. You smell horrid.&quot; She kept talking in a cheery mood as if completely obvious to my suffering. I continued to lay there on the floor in my miserable state, listening to Rarity's hoof steps as they drifted off towards the kitchen.With my head on the verge of exploding I slowly got on my feet and made my way up the stairs while the jingling of my chains further prodded my headache. </p><p><i>'What I would give for an aspirin right about now.'</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Half an hour later, in the kitchen....]</p></div><p>Breakfast, which was a simple serving of boiled eggs and salad with light dressings, was strangely....tense for some odd reason. Though Rarity kept a cheery smile there was something <i>off</i> about it all. Considering how drunk I was last night the odds of me being the cause was extremely high. A part of me knew I should probably just back off and pretend nothing happened, then again considering that she's a pony I would <i>REALLY</i> like to know if anything and what happened.</p><p>&quot;So Rarity, about last night,&quot; I began nervously. &quot;Did...did I do anything?&quot; Rarity eyed me from across the table suspiciously.</p><p>&quot;You’re asking as if you don’t remember.&quot; She kept staring at me trying to judge my reaction probably thinking I was faking it or something, not a good sign. </p><p>&quot;That’s cause I don’t, at least not all of it,&quot; I replied while fiddling with my salad. &quot;I know I got back late, which by the way I'd like to apologize for. And I remember wanting to do...I don’t know, <i>something</i>, but it's all a blur after I left the bar. Can't quite remember how I ended up sleeping on your couch either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm...&quot; hummed Rarity as she continued to ponder my words. Again, not a good sign.</p><p>&quot;Rarity if I insulted you, or heaven forbid hurt you in anyway, then I'm sorry. I'll admit I underestimated the drinks they served, but that's still not an excuse to get as drunk as I did. So again, I'm sorry for what I did. Whatever it was.&quot; Much to my surprise and fear, tears began to form around the corner of Rarity’s eyes.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry Rodney, but what you did....I-I don't think....&quot; Her voice was unsteady and it looked like she was about to break down right there in front of me.</p><p><i>'Oh.......shit.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rarity I-I swear I didn't mean to! Believe me if there was anything that I could do to-AH dammit I walked straight into that one didn’t I?&quot; I rubbed my face in frustration surprised and disappointed at myself for falling to such a simple ploy. </p><p>With smug, satisfied smile, she wiped the tears from her eyes with a hoof. &quot;Yes I believe you did, though it's '<i>trotted</i> straight into'. As to what you will be doing for me, I think I will keep an open mind for now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Within reason I hope,&quot; I replied irritably.</p><p>&quot;You truly do not remember?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said, bits and pieces but nothing coherent. In all seriousness though, I didn't do anything to hurt you did I?&quot; I asked in a serious tone.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Rodney, it was mostly just....frustrating. But let's not dwell on it further shall we. Now stop playing with your food and clean the dishes for me while I pick up Sweetie Belle from the farm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure thing Rares.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And do try to be on time for your session with Twilight today. It's not proper to keep a lady waiting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh right, thanks for the reminder.&quot; Rarity picked up her empty plate and placed it inside the sink with a spell before leaving the kitchen and heading out the front door while I stayed in the kitchen with my breakfast. &quot;Wait a minute, you never said what I-&quot; before I could finish I heard the front door close, &quot;-did....damn.&quot;</p><p>I let out a frustrated breath before before getting back to my breakfast with my brain still throbbing in pain. I took a few more mouthfuls of green before picking up my plate and dumping the remainder into the bin. I knew I should probably eat something after getting as wasted as I did but I just didn't have any appetite at the moment, plus the lack of meat didn't help either.</p><p><i>'Might as well head on early, at least I’ll get a few questions answered.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Ask her if she can get Luna of our ass.'</span></p><p><i>'Doubt it, from the sound of that letter she’s pretty dead set on torturing me. Besides right now I'm hoping more for an aspirin of some kind.'</i> After cleaning up the kitchen table and washing the dishes I headed out the door. Despite the abundant rays of sunlight it was still quite early in the morning, something I was thankful for since there were only a handful of ponies trotting around town at this time. Thanks to my headaches I wasn’t in any mood to socialize with anyone that I don’t even know. With a sigh I began to make my way to the meeting point.</p><p>For obvious safety reasons Twilight and I agreed to meet by the lakeside outside of town when out session deals in more practical training and research. In most cases Twilight would just drop by the store for the theoretical side of research and to make sure I kept up with my studies in magical theory. The constant pestering and late night reading reminded me a lot of my earlier days of academia which helped me get past the more frustrating nights of study. I was tempted on multiple occasion to throw Twilight’s <i>Fundamental Application of Advance Magical Equations</i> out the window, or straight at her face. The entire book, one thousand six hundred and seventy two pages in all, was basically a giant ‘fuck you’ to the laws of nature and everything I knew about physics. Although I had to admit that it offered several interesting ideas I’d like to test out, whether or not I should share these ideas with Twilight however is still to be determined. Something tells me these ponies don’t have the same level of appreciation humans do in making shit blow up. </p><p>It didn’t take long before I reached the edge of Ponyville now that I’ve memorized a good portion of the town to memory and it took even less time to reach the lake after. To my surprise I spotted Twilight sitting under a tree comfortably reading a book with several others stacked next to her. Another curious sight was seeing Spike relaxing next to the purple unicorn snacking on a giant chunk of emerald, or what’s left of it, along with several other gemstones inside a small picnic basket nreaby.</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; Spike shouted as soon as he saw me.</p><p>&quot;Sup Spike. What are you doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's been wanting to come with me for our sessions for some time now,&quot; answered Twilight as she placed the book she was reading atop the stack next to her.</p><p>&quot;So who's watching the library?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Owlowiscious is, the feathers on his wing have grown back so he should do fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He can operate a library?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not entirely, he's smart enough to know where all the books are so he can give anypony the book they need. As for keeping the log, I wrote a note asking everypony that borrows a book to write their name and such.&quot;</p><p><i>'I guess that'll work considering crime hardly exist here.'</i></p><p>&quot;So what got you so interested Spike?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You guys have been seeing each other out here for a while now,&quot; replied the dragon. &quot;I just wanted to know what you guys were doing out here all alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Spike!&quot; shouted Twilight as her face flushed bright red. </p><p>&quot;What?&quot; he asked innocently. My mood might be a bit sour at the moment with the headache but even that wouldn't deter me from such a perfect setup.</p><p>&quot;Well, looks like the jig is up Twilight,&quot; I said with fake resignation. </p><p>Twilight’s flustered face now gazed up at me in confusion, &quot;What are you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please Twilight, let's not pretend any longer,&quot; I cut in with some drama. &quot;All those amazing moments we spent together exploring forbidden-&quot;</p><p>&quot;<span style="font-size:1.375em">WHAT!?</span>&quot; shrieked Twilight in both complete embarrassment and anger.</p><p>&quot;Twilight what is he talking about?&quot; asked Spike with a raised brow.</p><p>&quot;Nothing!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh Twilight you wound me,&quot; I continued in a wounded tone. &quot;After all the time we spent in each other's embrace.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; shouted Twilight as her horn glowed brightly.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You might have gone a bit overboard there.'</span> </p><p>Before I could say anything to calm the unicorn down something wet and heavy fell on my head just as a large shadow fell over me. I tilted my head straight back to gaze up at the sky, but instead of seeing the bright blue sky all I saw was large blob of brown mud floating just a few feet above me. Ever so slowly I tilted my head back down to look at Twilight who was now smiling devilishly as she narrowed her eyes with malicious intent.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/0586703ebb60235c15d4c56ac13528034bfc2d7b?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc01.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2012%2F151%2F1%2Fc%2Ftwilight_sparkle____evil_face_by_mysteriouskaos-d50jk81.png" /></p></div><p>&quot;Got anything else to say?&quot; she asked in a smug victorious tone.</p><p>&quot;Uhh....&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's what I thought.&quot;</p><br/><br/><p><span style="font-size:2em">SPLAT!</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later.....]</p></div><p>I shook my head about wildly like a dog spraying the water out of my hair as I made my way out of the shallow waters. It was easy enough to get rid of the gunk off me since it mostly just drifted off in the water, though it took a great deal of effort to clean my clothes. It didn’t take long for me to give up seeing as it would take some detergent or even magic to clean it completely.</p><p><i>'Rarity's gonna give me another earful for this.'</i> Luckily the fresh cold water helped dampen the headache a bit which improved my mood a bit. In any case I wasn’t going to hold any grudge at Twilight for what she did, after all it was mostly my fault for teasing her. It was also impossible not to smile while hearing Spike’s wild childlike laughter, eventually both Twilight and I started to chuckle along with him. </p><p>&quot;Learned your lesson?&quot; asked Twilight with a little bit of smugness in her voice.</p><p>&quot;For now,&quot; I answered teasingly which caused Twilight to roll her eyes in irritation.</p><p>&quot;Such a foal,&quot; she mumbled under her breath.</p><p>&quot;Are you two always like this?&quot; Spike asked as his laughing fit finally died out.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered casually as I continued to approach them. I saw Twilight roll her eyes a second time, which caused me to chuckle in humor. &quot;So any news from Celestia?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finally decided to stop playing around have you?&quot; I gave her a shrug and let her have the last word in. &quot;Yes, she did. In summary, she has no problem with you being in public and all. However...&quot;</p><p>&quot;However?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She wants to keep the nature of your abilities a secret, or at the very least a low profile until she deems it safe to reveal it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because otherwise some ponies might panic knowing there's someone out there like me?&quot; Seeing as magic was a natural part of these ponies, hell for every living thing in this world, it made sense how someone like me would impose a primal-like fear on them.</p><p>&quot;Precisely. She believes that if ponies knew too soon it will hurt your chances of being accepted by the everypony.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sound advice. Luckily, the ponies that do know are ones I trust, though I'll have to make sure Rarity doesn't gossip about it. Funny how she never brought it up, I'm assuming you told her after the whole disaster with her boutique?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not....everything in detail, but yes, she knows. Though you shouldn't worry about her spreading it around, she might like to gossip but never anything that might hurt anypony.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm....Twilight, what are you two talking about?&quot; Spike's nervous voice reminded both Twilight and I of the little dragon's presence. It's always just been Twilight and I during our sessions and we'd completely forgotten about him.</p><p>&quot;Oh, uh...I....we were...that's-,&quot; Twilight kept stuttering on as she tried desperately to find an alternate explanation, other than me stealing magic away.</p><p>&quot;You know how my magic appears like blue fire, right?&quot; I answered for her without missing a beat.</p><p>&quot;Yeah that was pretty cool.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And do you remember how the town went crazy when they thought Carousel Boutique was burning?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Everypony knows about that.&quot; I stared at him for a second as he connected the two pieces together. &quot;Ooooohh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's why I need to be careful about where I use my magic. Until everyone knows about it, of course.&quot; There were some holes in my reasoning but it was solid enough to be believable for the young dragon. I noticed Twilight mouthing the words <i>good job</i> at me.</p><p>&quot;Now then, about your body,&quot; continued Twilight.</p><p>&quot;I didn't realize you were interested in me that way Twily, see something you like?&quot; I teased with a mischievous smile while cocking my brows up and down seductively. With a smile her horn glowed brightly once again causing me to tense up just as I heard something break the surface of the lake behind me. It didn't take a genius to figure out what she was lifting out of the water. </p><p>&quot;Alright, alright!&quot; I shouted while waving my hands about. &quot;No more, I promise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good.” I could hear something heavy hit the water as she terminated her spell. &quot;So about your unique stamina and magic differentiation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean how my stamina and magic are two completely different things?&quot; I asked for simplification sake.</p><p>&quot;Yes, that. Now it's only a theory, but since this world is rich with magic while yours is completely devoid of it, I suspect somewhere along the line we evolved differently. Somehow, your kind adapted to a world without magic while on the other hoof we ponies have adapted to one brimming with magic, thus our bodies and organs evolved to work with it. Unicorns with our horns, pegasi with their wings and even though earth ponies lack anything similar, their entire body reacts to magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That makes sense I suppose, but then how come I'm able to react to magic so fluently just like you? Granted, I still had to learn from scratch but still, by your theory I should be completely incapable of interacting with magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes I'm aware there are inconsistencies in this theory but it's all I can come up within a day. And don't get me started with your magical properties, I still don't have the slightest clue why yours react so violently in its neutral state. Or why it manifests as blue fire for that matter!&quot; Without realizing it Twilight had started ranting out her frustration.</p><p>&quot;Exactly how many hours of sleep have you lost researching?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Too much,&quot; answered Spike with some irritation and worry in his voice.</p><p>&quot;Spike!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now listen here Twilight, I'm glad you're investing so much time for me but not when it starts to affect your health,&quot; I voiced my concern with a bit of scolding. &quot;Besides, not knowing why and how things work doesn't mean I can't use it. I was just curious is all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait, so you don't really care if-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope,&quot; I replied casually. &quot;Like I said, just curious. Knowing the inner workings of my magic doesn't really change anything, now does it? I can still live, eat, sleep, do my job at Rarity’s, and I'm still stranded in this world with no chance of getting back home.&quot; Although I threw that out casually the air around us suddenly became tense. What surprised me most was how it caused a sudden pang of heartache in me. I might have accepted that I won’t ever get back home, but if this feeling of loss and heaviness was any indication I suppose I wasn’t truly at peace with it yet.</p><p>&quot;I'm so sorry-&quot; Twilight started but I raised a hand to stop her.</p><p>&quot;No, Twilight, it's ok. Well no, not really. In fact it sucks. But none of it is your fault so please, don't start getting all gloomy on my behalf.&quot; Twilight started smiling a bit but it was easy to tell she still felt bad for my predicament, it’s probably best to change the topic. &quot;Spike, you're in charge of keeping an eye on her got it? You tell me if she’s not taking care of herself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes sir!&quot; replied the dragon as he gave me a salute. </p><p>&quot;And exactly what will you do if I don’t?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We both know the main reason you’re so enthusiastic is because it’s all so fun for you. The challenge of exploring new fields of research and the need to know the unknown, admit it Twily you’re an egghead.&quot; I smiled with my arms crossed over my chest, &quot;I’ll just stop cooperating in your research and suspend our sessions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You wouldn’t dare!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Try me.&quot;</p><p>Her eyes bored straight into my own as we stared at each other for a few seconds. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said irritably. &quot;Can we move on? Let’s see if you’ve made any progress on Infusion.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Sure.&quot; I walked a few steps away to grab a small pebble from the ground before rejoining Twilight and Spike. I sat in front of them, legs crossed, as I held the pebble in my right hand inside a fist as I began to concentrate and inject the pebble with magic.</p><p>My first hurdle was figuring how to fine tune the flow of my magic, much like I would use Constant Siphon on someone but in reverse. The trick was to inject as much magic as it could hold because the moment I stop the magic will start to disperse, the less attuned the object was to magic the quicker it would escape. It was like trying to trap water inside a balloon with holes. Unfortunately I can't just pour in magic recklessly either, too much and it'll break with a loud pop like a firecracker, much to Rarity's great displeasure during the nights I practiced. That is, however, until I realized I could use my 'Sight' for better timing. Imagine pouring water into a cup and finding the exact moment to stop right before it started to overflow and that was basically it. Instead of gauging how much magic I was using I just had to watch out for any flames escaping, there was a very small window after that point before the rocks I practiced on would break. I've only had limited success so far, but at least it was now a question of training rather than experimentation.</p><p>&quot;So what do you think?&quot; I stretched my arm out towards Twilight and opened my fist to show her the pebble.</p><p>&quot;You seem confident,&quot; she commented. Her horn glowed as she applied a modified light enchantment on the rock. Twilight made this simple enchantment specifically to measure roughly how much progress I’ve made. Unlike a normal light enchantment which acts like a light bulb and emits a constant level of brightness, this one instantly consumes all the magic in a single bright flash of light: the more magic, the brighter the flash.</p><p>For a brief moment the pebble glowed a darker shade of purple much like Twilight's horn, before the enchantment took full effect and created a flash of light with roughly the same intensity as a camera. The flash of light caused my head to throb again in pain as my headache started to grow making me groan slightly in pain.</p><p>&quot;Well certainly an improvement from last week, last time it...Rodney are you ok?&quot; asked Twilight once she noticed I was massaging the side of my forehead with my other hand.</p><p>&quot;Just a headache from....just a headache.&quot; I decided it wasn't worth potentially getting yelled at for being drunk. &quot;You wouldn't happen to have any medicine to alleviate pain would you?&quot; I asked hopefully.</p><p>&quot;I actually do but....&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's still me not being a pony to worry about, yeah I figured as much.&quot; I let out a sigh of frustration. &quot;Looks like I'll just have to deal with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why don't we stop here and reschedule for next week?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah I'm good,&quot; I assured her. &quot;Let's move on. What's next?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well if you're sure. Spike, could you give us one of your gems please?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do I have to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come now don't be greedy. You remember what happened last time don't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right,&quot; he answered in resignation. The baby dragon shoved his arm into the picnic basket and procured a large sapphire in his claws.</p><p>&quot;Straight to top Twily?&quot; I asked slightly surprised. &quot;I thought we were going at it step by step.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's no need to, if you're able to inject that much magic into a rock like that you can manage most other materials,&quot; she reasoned. &quot;Gemstones have the highest attunement to magic thus they’re the easiest material to infuse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what's the point?&quot; I asked as Spike handed me the apple sized sapphire .</p><p>&quot;For research of course,&quot; she answered happily. &quot;This way I actually have a supply of your magic to work with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pffft!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It just sounded like....nevermind. It’s just a human thing,&quot; I said with a smile as I held down the urge to laugh. &quot;So how much-pfft, of my magic do you want?&quot; Twilight was starting to stare at me suspiciously as bits of laughter escaped my lips.</p><p>&quot;As much as you can give me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bwahahahaaaa!&quot; I tilted over to the side from my sitting position in a sudden hysterical laugh.</p><p>&quot;WHAT!?&quot; asked Twilight clearly realizing I was laughing at her expense.</p><p>&quot;It's no-hehe, nothing to worry-hehehahaHAHAHA!&quot; I tried to settle down but Twilight's irritated look made me lose it again.</p><p>&quot;What's so funny?&quot; asked the confused dragon.</p><p>&quot;I don't care anymore,&quot; replied Twilight with a sigh.</p><p>&quot;Ok....ok, it's passing,&quot; I said between panted breath as I returned to a sitting position. &quot;Phew, right. Let's get this over with before you say anything else.&quot; With a big smile on my face I began injecting the sapphire with magic. My humored demeanor soon turned to curiosity once I realized how the process was remarkably easy compared to the rocks I've been practicing on. Unlike those, which felt like they were fighting back, the sapphire acted like it wanted to absorb my magic like a sponge. I slowly began to increase the flow of magic with less finesse and the sapphire kept eating it up no problem, it almost felt like the sapphire was draining me. It didn't take long before I had used up my entire supply of magic.</p><p>&quot;Oh man, exactly how much magic can this thing take?&quot; I asked astounded staring at the sapphire in my right hand.</p><p>&quot;A battery gem that size could easily power one of my lab equipment for a week even if I use it non-stop,&quot; answered Twilight with a smile.</p><p>&quot;And how long till the magic starts to disperse?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never,&quot; replied Twilight casually.</p><p>&quot;Are you serious!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well to be more precise nopony knows exactly when. Gemstones and certain rare metals are the few materials in the world that can naturally retain magic for an incredibly long period of time. There have been discoveries of arcane gems within lush forests dating back thousands of years, which means that at some point that forest was once a barren landscape.&quot; I could tell Twilight was about to go into lecture mode and from Spike's groan, so did he. Luckily I was able to cut in just in time.  </p><p>&quot;But exactly how much magic can it take?&quot; I asked again.</p><p>&quot;Nopony knows that one either, we can guess based on data but so far nopony has ever discovered a fully charged arcane gem before. And since nopony has ever been able to replicate an arcane gem before it's impossible to know for certain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So wait, not even Rarity's fire ruby was fully charged? That's insane!!&quot; After experiencing first hand how much magic that thing had I was having trouble believing it. &quot;But what kept you from replicating arcane gems? It's not like you lack magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's because at a certain point the gem would, for reasons yet undiscovered, refuse to take any more. The difference between a battery and an arcane gem is simply how much magic they have, the light you see inside arcane gems are just heavily condense magic. That limit is what prevents us from replicating arcane gems ourselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight, is it ok if you use <i>that</i> spell on me?&quot; Twilight looked at me not quite sure what I meant, only until I shot a glance at Spike did she manage to understand my cryptic question.</p><p>&quot;Oh, right. But what for?&quot; she asked as her horn glowed.</p><p>&quot;I just want to see for myself how much this sapphire can take,&quot; I explained.</p><p>&quot;Fair enough, it’ll give me more to work with.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Pfft!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is so funny!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, last one I promise.&quot; She shook her head in irritation before her horn started to glow. I wasn't sure what spell she was using on me but it didn't really matter since the point was just to have me drain it through my skin. My left hand, which was concealed away from Spike, glowed a dark shade of purple as Twilight cast her spell on it. Instantly I could 'feel' the flow of Twilight's magic as I siphoned it through my skin which I immediately started injecting into the sapphire.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Ten minutes later....]</p></div><p>&quot;Is it still working?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup,&quot; I answered.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Fourteen minutes later....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney is it-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still going Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, as interesting as this is,&quot; said Spike sarcastically. &quot;I think I’ll head on back to the library, I need to check if Owlowiscious is doing his job right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I better not find a missing tub of ice cream when I get home,&quot; warned Twilight like a mother to her child.</p><p>&quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; replied Spike offhandedly. </p><p>&quot;It was nice seeing you Spike.&quot; He gave me a casual wave before picking up the picnic basket and walked off towards Ponyville. 	</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Half an hour later....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney are you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Twilight I'm sure, I'm still injecting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Infusing,</i>&quot; Twilight corrected. &quot;You are infusing the gem right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whatever, 'injecting' makes more sense to me. And yes I am, otherwise my head would've exploded by now with all the magic you gave me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This doesn't make sense, we should have reached the limit a while ago,&quot; said Twilight with a bit of strain in her voice.</p><p>&quot;You doing alright there Twily?&quot; I asked as I took my gaze away from the gem. Twilight had taken a sitting position with her head laying low as she continue to channel more magic into me. &quot;We can stop whenever you want.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, I've still got plenty of.....,&quot; Twilight's voice drifted off while her pupils started to expand. The glow from her horn disappeared as she stared at my hand with her mouth still hanging open. Following her gaze I focused my attention back to the sapphire which have suddenly taken a brighter hue of blue than before. For a moment I thought it had just caught the rays of the sun, it took a second before I remembered we were sitting under the shade of a tree. I had to squint and bring the sapphire right up to my nose to see but without a doubt there was something inside that was giving off light. </p><p>&quot;Let me see that!&quot; shouted Twilight as she suddenly leaped on top of me and wrapped her hooves around my right arm. I grunted in slight pain as I fell back only to groan again when the chains on my left hand fell on my face. Twilight started twisting and moving my hand around in order to get a better view, she even twisted her head to the side to bring the gem closer to her eye. </p><p>&quot;This shouldn't be possible! Ok what did you do!? &quot; she asked without even turning her gaze away from the gem.</p><p>&quot;First off, could you please get off me?&quot; Since she was using her front hooves to hold my arm in place it forced her to sit on top of hip. &quot;Not sure if you’ve noticed but somebody can <i>REALLY</i> get the wrong idea if they see us right now.&quot; With her face completely beet red she let go of my arm and almost jumped away in her haste to get off me. </p><p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said in an embarrassed tone as i got back to my sitting position.  </p><p>&quot;As to your question, it's magic the hell should I know,&quot; I replied in a teasing tone. I could tell Twilight was about to start ranting or something but I stopped her before she could even get a word out. </p><p>&quot;You know what's even more interesting? I didn’t feel any resistance at all which means that we can still pump in more magic.&quot; Twilight's pupil widened as my words sunk in. &quot;What do you say Twily? Think you got enough in you to charge this thing?&quot; I asked as I lifted the gem right in front of her muzzle teasingly. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Three hours later.....]</p></div><p>&quot;So how does it feel Twilight?&quot; I asked while running my left hand over her neck. &quot;Knowing that you've not only created the first ever artificial arcane gem, but the first pony to see a fully charged one.&quot; Although she was smiling brightly all I got in return were more panted breaths as she lay sideways on the ground with her head resting atop my leg. &quot;Although I think we might have gotten a bit overboard.&quot;</p><p>I turned my gaze back at the sapphire in my hand, or tried to anyways until I was forced to turn away from the intense light with tears in my eyes and spots in my vision. Unlike Rarity's fire ruby which glowed and shined much like a small candle or lantern, what I held in my hand looked more like a light bulb from an industry level spotlight. I wasn't sure if it was because of my magic or it simply being a sapphire that caused the light to shine a brilliant shade of blue, the imperfections of the gem created even more variation of color creating something similar to a light show around us. Despite the sun hanging above us, anyone could easily see the bright blue star I held in my hand from miles away.</p><p>&quot;I...I can't wait...to show the Princess,&quot; answered Twilight between large heavy panting. Over the hours Twilight and I have been sitting comfortably under a tree, yet for her it looked more like she had just ran through the New York marathon. &quot;We...need to name it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How's about the Star of Rodney?&quot; With what little energy remaining Twilight nudged her head towards me causing her horn to poke me in the stomach. &quot;I'm just teasing Twily, honestly it's up to you. After all you did all the work, I was just a relay for your magic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess I can think of something later...la...&quot; slowly her eyelids closed and soon enough her breathing became the rhythmic sound of sleep as she succumbed to exhaustion.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You know what’s frightening about all this?'</span></p><p><i>'You mean the insane amount of magic she just used to charge the gem all on her own? Yeah I realize that.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Sleeping on our lap might just be the single most powerful being in this world. Excluding Celestia and Luna.'</span> Looking back at the bright light of the gem I activated my ‘Sense’ which caused me to flinch as I felt the searing ‘heat’ the gem was radiating next to me, it felt like I was holding a ball of magma. </p><p><i>'So much in something so small.'</i> The thought of absorbing that much magic caused me to shiver in fear. <i>'That much magic could easily fry my brain and turn me into a vegetable.'</i> Fearing to attract unwanted attention I quickly began digging a small hole next to me and buried the gem in it which instantly returned the scenery around us back to normal.</p><p>Confident that the gem was safe and concealed I began rubbing Twilight's neck as I leaned back against the tree and closed my eyes. I may not be as exhausted as Twilight but the mental strain had started to pile up sometime after the first hour.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 26 - It's a human thing, get used to it<br/>Edited by Noxxels and (slightly by) RandomEncounter </p><hr/><p>&quot;...we suffered some delays due to errors in shipment. However, thanks to Mr. Fancy Pants and his logistics team we were able to solve the issue and construction of the railroad is back on schedule.&quot; The unicorn mare shuffled through the vast amount of reports and graphs in front of her as she continued to summarize them all to the regal white alicorn sitting across table. Not many can keep a cool head during their first meeting with the monarch, let alone give a detailed report. It comes to no surprise then that Celestia paid more attention to the mare then on the report she gave. </p><p>&quot;There is an issue regarding the tunnel. We planned to finish cutting through the mountain by the time the railroad catches up, however the digging crew simply isn't able to work fast enough to reach the deadline. We are considering the use of explosives to-&quot; The mare was interrupted mid-speech when several knocks from the door grabbed everypony’s attention. Slowly the door opened to reveal the Captain of the Guard as he made his way inside. </p><p>&quot;Pardon the interruption, Your Majesty, but the....<i>guest</i> you requested has arrived.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Thank you Captain, I’ll be with you shortly.&quot; Celestia turned her attention towards the guard on her right. &quot;Could you please inform Professor Inquest to meet me in front of the throne room.&quot; The pegasus guard gave a salute with a wing before trotting past Shining who gave him a quick nod as he exited the room. </p><p>&quot;As for the the use of explosives,&quot; continued the monarch as she looked back at the mare across the table, &quot;that is completely out of the question. I will not risk the lives of my little ponies simply to meet a deadline. Either work around the delay or find another solution.&quot; Though she spoke like a mother scolding her child, it came from a monarch greatly adored and loved by her subjects. It was more than enough to silence any debate. &quot;We will continue with the rest of the report tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, Your Majesty.&quot; The mare began to gather and re-organize the many papers spread out in front of her while Celestia stood up and made her way towards the door followed by Shining and her remaining personal guard. </p><p>A minute after they started trotting through the hallways in silence Celestia began to speak again. &quot;I'm surprised you took time off from your duty to inform me personally Captain. You could have simply sent a guard or even the staff to inform me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Permission to speak freely, Your Highness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Granted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel somewhat confused as to why you would ask to see such a po-I mean, gryphon. That's not to say I have anything against gryphons,&quot; Shining quickly corrected. &quot;it's just that this particular one has quite a record for violence. Even for a gryphon. I believe it best that I remain by your side.&quot; </p><p>&quot;If you would look closer into those records you would realize they occur within or around local bars and that nopony was ever truly endangered.&quot; Celestia smiled in humor seeing Shining recall the reports a second time in his mind.</p><p>&quot;And exactly how did you know that?&quot; he asked curiously. Before Celestia could answer they were greeted by a very disgruntled voice.</p><p>&quot;You had better have a good reason for taking me away from my research, Celestia.&quot; Just in front of the giant double doors leading to the throne room stood an old gray unicorn who clearly preferred to be elsewhere. &quot;I am very close to finishing one of my thesis and I have a great many experiments to oversee.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You will address and speak to Her Highness with respect!&quot; shouted Shining with a scowl. Instead of anger or contempt, Inquest merely gave the captain a bored and uninterested look. </p><p>&quot;I see you've still got that stick up your flank <i>boy</i>,&quot; spoke the grizzled unicorn flatly with only the slightest emphasis at the end. </p><p>&quot;That’s quite enough you two,&quot; warned the monarch.</p><p>&quot;My apologies, Your Majesty.&quot; Shining Armor silently scolded himself for losing his cool and composure so easily in Celestia’s presence. </p><p>&quot;So, care to explain why you've ordered the guards to drag me away from my research?&quot; Shining's eye twitched just the slightest bit as Inquest continued to converse with the Princess in his own ever frustrating way. </p><p>&quot;I'll explain everything inside.&quot; As Celestia trotted towards the throne room the two unicorn guards quickly used their magic to open the giant doors. &quot;For now, there's an old friend we have to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;<span style="font-size:1.5em">INQUEST!!</span>&quot; With their ears flattening out of reflex against the loud shout, everypony turned their attention to the source. </p><p>There in the center of the throne room, flanked by two royal soldiers, stood what could easily be the largest gryphon Shining had ever seen. Larger than any earth pony soldier under his command and only a head shorter from Celestia, the gryphon easily towered over most ponies. With size alone anypony would have assumed the gryphon to be male, but with a second look Shining noticed how the gryphon had far too many feminine characteristics to be a male. </p><p>Despite the massive amount of muscle in her body the gryphon still had a sharper and more streamlined body structure. It was generally difficult to determine the age of a gryphon from looks alone, but if Shining had to guess she was quite aged. Perhaps nearing or even older than the professor. There were several scars running across her body, mainly around the front chest and limbs with a few scratches on her beak. She wore a belt and multiple straps across her body lined with pockets of various sizes, some with holes and others stuffed full with roots and leaves.</p><p>Despite her size, she turned and took a leaping stance faster than the guards beside her could react. With a single beat of her wings she lunged with predatory speed towards them, or to be more accurate, straight at the professor. For Inquest, the physical prowess of the gryphon was well known to him. He knew at this point any attempt to dodge, or even teleport, would be far too late. Resigning himself to his fate, Inquest could only turn and glare at Celestia with eyes that shot daggers.</p><p>&quot;I hate you so much right now,&quot; he spoke flatly before being barreled down by the giant avian predator. With several quick movements the gryphon rolled across the floor mitigating any damage both would have suffered from the impact before easily rising back up to a sitting position. As entertaining it was to see the old pony get what's due, Shining was still the Captain of the Royal Guard and the gryphon had just assaulted somepony in front of him. </p><p>&quot;Guards! Seize her!&quot; Even before Shining's order the soldiers around the throne room had already taken action and were in position to subdue. But just before any of them could act they were stopped in their tracks by a raised wing from Celestia. Shining's worries came to a rest when Celestia gave him a knowing look and a nod indicating that something of this nature was expected.</p><p>&quot;GAH! Release me this instant Crea!!&quot; shouted Inquest as he struggled to free himself from the gryphon's bear hug. Inquest was by no means weak despite his age, physically stronger than most guards in the castle even, yet it was clear that the gryphon completely outmatched the pony in strength. </p><p>&quot;Aww, still the wumpy grumpy pony as ever,&quot; she teased as if talking to a foal. She sat on her rump with both her front limbs wrapped around Inquest while rubbing the side of her face on his neck affectionately. Though Celestia was clearly enjoying the scene, with her giggles reverberating beautifully around like bells, it was an effort for Shining and the guards around to remain professional seeing the old pony being treated like a giant stuffed doll. </p><p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Inquest's horn suddenly started glowing bleach white which quickly began to spread and cover his entire body. Seconds later he disappeared in a bright white flash and reappeared at the opposite far end of the throne room looking absolutely pissed. The gryphon had already taken another leaping stance with her wings spread out to her sides ready to chase after. Knowing that this could easily continue on endlessly, Celestia decided it was best to intervene and moved in between the two.</p><p>&quot;It's good to see you’re still as energetic as ever, Crea.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Hey Celes, how you've been?&quot; replied the gryphon casually like an old friend. </p><p>&quot;I'm well, thank you for asking.&quot; Celestia turned to the Shining. &quot;Captain, allow me to introduce to you one of the best-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahem&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>The</i> best and finest hunter of the Gryphon Confederation, Crea Whistwind.&quot;</p><p>(AN: Pronounced &quot;kree-ya&quot;) </p><p>&quot;Hey,&quot; she greeted as she held out a claw towards Shining.</p><p>&quot;Shining Armor, Captain of the Royal Guard,&quot; he replied as he placed a hoof in her claw only to regret it the next moment when she grasped it with a bit too much strength. &quot;Exactly how have you come to know the Princess?&quot; he asked while trying to hide his discomfort.</p><p>&quot;I've done some odd jobs for her here and there,&quot; she answered casually.</p><p>&quot;Don't let her answer fool you Captain, Crea has done Equestria a great service numerous times in the past,&quot; added Celestia. &quot;She and Inquest have gone through many adventures together on my behalf.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've read all the reports of the professor's accomplishments and exploits. So you're the gryphon that he often travels with. Why was your name never mentioned?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's just shy is all,&quot; she answered before leaning down and whispering in Shining’s ear, &quot;he doesn't want others to know that he's my mate.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You two are married!?&quot; shouted Shining in surprise, the shock of the news causing his discipline to slip momentarily. </p><p>&quot;Lies! I never agreed to such a union!!&quot; screamed Inquest who was still keeping his distance. </p><p>&quot;That's not what the Zebras think!&quot; Crea shouted teasingly in return. </p><p>&quot;It was a drink! They offered us a drink while we were in the middle of the plains during drought season! Anypony would have accepted the offer!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;As entertaining as it is to reminisce,&quot; Celestia interrupted, &quot;there is an urgent matter I’d like to discuss. Let us move to a more comfortable room and continue there.&quot; </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Meanwhile.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Here you go sir, our three cut, slow roasted, dry-aged, USDA prime porterhouse T-bone steak combo over roasted vegetables with a side of golden fries and fresh coleslaw. Enjoy.&quot; </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/47448a57cdb95f759dc21c49753deb418ee8dbb5?url=http%3A%2F%2Featscotland.visitscotland.com%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2Fnew%2Fmussel-and-steak-bar-2" /></p></div><p>&quot;Oooooooh c'mere my pretty.&quot; I grabbed the wooden board and dragged it close while taking a large whiff and savoring the smell. I could even hear the oil in the meat still crackling from the heat as is oozed down the sized glazing the tender beef and giving it a near perfect shine. With a fork I punctured the closest steak, which spewed out thick flavorful juices, and began cutting it apart with a steak knife. Like hot knife to butter the meat easily parted open with hardly any resistance, a testimony to its tenderness. </p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;You might wanna hurry with that.&quot;</span> I jerked my head up and looked at the opposite side of the dining table only to see a mirror copy of myself sitting there crossed legged with arms folded across his chest. Or he would have been a mirror copy if the whites of his eyes wasn’t blazing blue and glowing. It didn't take long for me to figure out who it was.</p><p>&quot;I'm not sharing!&quot; I shouted as I dragged the plate even closer until it was touching my chest. </p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Really? Here I am fully materialized in your dream meeting face to face for the first time and the first thing you say is: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">I'm not sharing?</span><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;</span> He chuckled and shook his head before gazing longingly at the meal in front of me. <span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Guess I shouldn't be surprised.&quot;</span> Seeing as he has yet to make any move for my plate I began to ease off and grabbed my utensils. </p><p>&quot;So what the hell are you here for then?&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Just thought I'd drop by,&quot;</span> he answered with a shrug. <span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;I have been wondering though.&quot;</span></p><p>&quot;About what?&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Us.&quot;</span> I cocked my brow at him. <span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Well, specifically myself being as I am.&quot;</span></p><p>&quot;Where the hell did this come from?&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Just random thoughts. As entertaining it is to be your subconscious I find things a bit dull sometimes so I’ve been thinking about what I’m suppose to do. Sure I'll warn you about something and you'll completely ignore which one day will be the end of us, but what if there's anything else beside.&quot;</span></p><p>&quot;Hearing and talking to a voice inside my head is bad enough, I don't need you to start getting ideas about helping me. The last thing I need is for you to play psychiatrist. It's not like I'm going crazy or anything, all things considered I've done a fabulous job coping with things. Hell I even have a job.&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Ok first, it's not a job, it's recompense for wrecking her house. Second, you've only accepted the fact and idea of being stuck here, there's a difference between accepting and coping. And third, you better take that bite quickly.&quot;</span></p><p>&quot;What?&quot; </p><p><span style="color:#6495ED">&quot;Too late.&quot;</span> Suddenly everything started to shake violently for a few seconds before it all disappeared into darkness. </p><hr/><p><span style="font-size:0.5em">&quot;Rodney!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:0.75em">&quot;Rodney!&quot;</span></p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Wake up!&quot; The first sensation my mind registered were the two hooves bent over my shoulders, the shaking, then Twilight's voice, and finally realizing that I've woken up from my lucid dream. </p><p><a href="http://nooooooooooooooo.com/" rel="nofollow">&quot;NOOOOOO!!!&quot;</a></p><p>(AN: Press the button. Thank you Tensa :D)</p><p>&quot;Aah!&quot; yelped Twilight as I jolted to a sitting position, sending Twilight tumbling backwards. </p><p>&quot;Oh god it was so close!!&quot; </p><p>&quot;What are you yell-&quot; Twilight froze mid sentence as I gave her a death glare. &quot;Uhm, Rodney?&quot; she asked nervously with her ears flat against her head. I reached out with both hands and grasped her head before bringing my face to stare directly into her gigantic eyes.</p><p>&quot;I was that close Twilight,&quot; I whispered menacingly. &quot;<i>THAT</i>. Close. Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, I....I couldn't find the sapphire,&quot; she answered now confused and somewhat scared of my erratic behavior. &quot;I...thought we lost it and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough,&quot; I let out a long sigh, &quot;I get it.&quot; I took a few deep breaths to calm myself which, unfortunately, didn't improve my mood. To make things worse my headache was slowly creeping back in. </p><p>&quot;Rodney, uhm...co-could you please let me go now?&quot; I ignored her plea for several seconds before suddenly looking up to her with a big beaming smile as an idea popped into my head.</p><p>&quot;I’m putting an end to this ‘no meat’ diet from Luna and you’re going to help me.&quot; My smile widened which prominently showed my teeth causing Twilight's eyes to shrink. If she was scared before she was downright frightened now. </p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Without answering I released her, got up, and made my way to the base of the tree. I could hear Twilight following as I bent over and removed the dirt covering the gem. It bathed the area once again in radiant hues of blue as I straightened up with it in hand. </p><p>&quot;YOU BURIED IT!?&quot; Twilight galloped over and would have barreled me down had I not moved out of the way. With the gem held up above my head I kept moving about as Twilight kept jumping up and down with her front hooves waving over her head in an attempt to grab the gem, which was hilarious considering she had no way of actually grabbing hold. She even tried biting on my chains in order to pull my hand down but I was still too quick for her.</p><p>&quot;Let me, ugh! See it, ugh! It could be damaged!&quot; she pleaded between jumps. </p><p>&quot;Now tell me, exactly how bad do you want this thing?&quot; I’ll admit it was a low and douchey move but right now I hardly cared. Twilight stopped just before she jumping and glared up at me. &quot;Don't worry I'm not holding it for ransom.&quot; I lightly threw the gem up in the air towards her which she quickly grabbed with her magic. She started spinning it in front of her as she inspected it for damage, or at least tried to. The brilliant shine of the gem made it impossible to see anything other than the intense light it gave off. &quot;Cause you're still gonna do what I say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what makes you say that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Simple. You're a good pers-er, pony Twilight.&quot; She cocked her brow at me curiously. &quot;For all I care you can take all the credit for the gem. Thing is, you'll still feel like you owe me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm...not sure if that was a compliment or-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's a human thing, get used to it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What if I say-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You won’t.&quot; Her eye twitched as she looked at me irritably. </p><p>&quot;Fine. What do you want?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What else?&quot; I leaned over and brought my face closer to her's, &quot;I want meat Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney I can’t-&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yes I know it's Luna's order, one of the rulers of Equestria and Celestia's sister. But eight ounces Twilight! That's all I'm asking.&quot; Seeing as Twilight was still about to argue I quickly grabbed both of her ears and started kneading and scratching them the same way I would to a dog. Whatever she was about to say came out slurred as I began to subdue her with my fingers. </p><p>&quot;I'll scratch your ears whenever you want for a whole week Twily. C'mon I know you love it.&quot; Twilight was resisting and was even about to remove my hands with a hoof but she quickly faltered once I intensified my efforts. I doubt Twilight even realized how she kept pressing and twisting her head towards my hands as her lips took an O shape while her body shivered in delight. Even her legs started to wobble a bit, not sure if she was still exhausted from charging the gem or from the sensation alone, maybe both. The floating arcane gem was also starting to erratically descend to the ground as Twilight's concentration began to waver under my assault. </p><p>&quot;Give in Twilight!&quot; I teased as I started to scratch the area between her head and neck. &quot;Give yourself to the dark side!&quot; I could see it in her eyes as she tried multiple times to resist which I easily crushed every single time by scratching a specific spot in the back of her left ear. </p><p>&quot;Fine, you win,&quot; she spoke in an angry tone. She tried to look angrily at me but she just couldn’t get rid of the smile on her face so long as I continued scratching her. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/0f599afab65d438e79b938088661522e0f81da40?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc01.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2012%2F325%2Fb%2F2%2Fachievement___corruptor_by_jtjandra-d5lq7m9.jpg" /></p></div><p>&quot;You're despicable,&quot; she said with great disdain.</p><p>&quot;Human,&quot; I shrugged. &quot;So, shall we head out to Fluttershy's then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can't ask her for meat! She's my best friend and I don't want her to think I'm doing anything weird.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just tell her it's for Spike. Dragons do eat meat right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes but not Spike, he follows a strict pony diet. He eats gems for what he needs from meat. Just give me time to think of something alright?&quot;</p><p>I let out a sigh, &quot;Fine.&quot; Twilight gave me another irritated look before her attention shifted back to the floating arcane gem next to her. &quot;I suppose there's gonna be an uproar once word of that thing goes out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not going public with this.&quot; I looked confusedly at her. &quot;Yet. Not until I understand it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, I suppose being the first to create an arcane gem isn't much if you can't explain how it was created.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly. And the only way to do that is to first learn and understand your magic, clearly yours is different from everypony. Having some <i>very</i> interesting properties.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that's the real prize you're chasing am I right? New magic, an entirely new type that plays on different rules.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes!&quot; squealed Twilight. &quot;Imagine the possibilities! By studying your magic we could create new spells that work under different, more efficient restrictions! Find breakthroughs in magical research and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the one to spearhead it all would be none other than Twilight Sparkle, Celestia’s prized student. Her name will go down in history as the unicorn to revolutionize magical research and practice forever.&quot; Twilight's pupils started to widen while her face took on a glazed expression as she suddenly started to skip around in a circle shouting atop her voice with the sapphire bobbing along beside her.</p><p>&quot;Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Too bad none of that's going to happen.&quot; Almost instantly Twilight froze mid air completely losing all momentum and floated there for a fraction of a second before falling back to the earth, reminds me of old Sunday morning cartoons. </p><p>&quot;Why!?&quot;</p><p>I closed my eyes and rubbed the side of my forehead hoping to ease my headache somewhat before answering, &quot;Two reasons Twily. One, Celestia still wants my powers to remain a secret which means anything you do that brings any attention to me puts that at risk. Second, I don't want people to-uh, you <i>ponies</i> to look at me as some kind of research subject that'll get them fame and glory.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney I wasn't-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Twilight I know, we wouldn't be having this discussion if I thought you were. The reason I've been cooperative with you is simply because I wanted to pay back for all the effort you’ve done for my sake. But most of all I see you as a friend, an egghead pony friend that loves to research and learn new things.&quot; I took a deep breath to calm myself seeing as I was starting to rant and talk more than I intended. </p><p>&quot;The point is that I don’t want to be poked and prodded for the rest of my life here. Even though I’m stuck here I still like to have a normal life if possible, well, normal as things get in this place. I’d like to own a property, a home, something to call my own even. I doubt those things will come easy when everybody sees me as nothing more than an arcane gem making machine. It's why I brought it up the first place, I wanted to know your plans for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry Rodney, I should have been more considerate and thought how you felt. I got so excited about everything that....I’m sorry.&quot; Twilight's head hung low with her ears fallen flat as she gazed at the ground feeling saddened. More so knowing the dream she imagined just a moment ago got shot down, I couldn't really blame her. </p><p>&quot;Cheer up Twilight, I'm not saying you'll never publicize anything.&quot; Her ears perked up as she looked up at me with hopeful eyes. &quot;Once Celestia's alright with it and I've properly settled down and have all I want then you have permission, who knows I might enjoy the attention. I'd still have what really matters even after.&quot; I bent down and gently rubbed Twilight's head. &quot;Besides, I suspect it'll take a long time even for you to uncover all the secrets of my magic, years or even decades even. I suspect you'll have your hooves busy while I find my place.&quot;</p><p>Twilight leaped and wrapped her hooves around my neck and started squeezing me in a tight embrace, &quot;Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight! Air!&quot; I wheezed through what little gap was left in my throat. </p><p>&quot;Oh my gosh I'm so sorry!&quot; she yelped as she pushed herself off me.</p><p><i>'Ponies. Denser body, more muscle.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'And she's a unicorn, imagine what Applejack could do.'</span> </p><p>Knowing that her work will eventually be made public Twilight's attention returned to the arcane game, &quot;I suppose I'll need some way to properly extract the raw magic from the crystal without triggering any explosives. Most likely design an entirely new spell specifically for that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Speaking of spells,&quot; I walked past her and snatched the gem from the air absorbing what little magic in Twilight's levitation spell, &quot;there's something I've been meaning to show you.&quot; Twilight looked curiously at me as I walked away. &quot;You're remember my shield spell right?&quot;</p><p>She rolled her eyes, &quot;Yes, the one that saved you when you hit Princess Luna just before our departure to Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And considering how smart you are,&quot; I glance at Twilight who was smiling at my compliment, &quot;I'm sure you've noticed the flaw in my design.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was hard <i>not</i> to notice you flying and crashing into the carriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well it did save me the trouble of running back in.&quot; I stopped and turned to face Twilight, now with a good seven meters between us. &quot;But yes, my shield spell only protects me from the impact, not from the actual force behind it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I assume you've made some improvements then? I have a spell bubble shield that works similar to yours, you could have asked me for help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I could, but where's the fun if the answers given? You of all should know that, being the egghead that you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're sounding quite like an egghead yourself Rodney.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Takes one to know one, I never said I wasn't. You're just the biggest one here.&quot; Twilight shook her head lightly at my jibe. &quot;But enough of that, yes I did make some adjustments ever since that whole incident at BonBon's store. But it goes beyond that, thanks to those books you lent me I was able to completely redesign the whole thing from the ground up. You might consider it a new spell entirely.&quot; Twilight rose an eyebrow at me curiously making me smile. &quot;But before I show you, I wanted to know if you also remember that conversation we had the day I started siphon training. When you asked me how that spell of yours works.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course! A spell the controls another spell, different types working together. There's a thesis I'm working on right now on how such a concept could be implemented to improve practical efficiency of spells. I even did a few experiments and-&quot;</p><p>Now it was my turn to roll my eyes as Twilight started started to give another of her impromptu lectures. &quot;Yes well,&quot; I interrupted her mid speech, &quot;would you like to see a practical example of that concept?&quot; Without answering she simply set on her haunches and started clapping both her front hooves together with a big smile in anticipation. I closed my eyes in concentration and activated my 'Sense', my whole body flinch and shivered as the gem bathed me in intense 'heat' from all the magic injected into it. I let out a hiss in pain as my headache seemed to flare up in response.</p><p>&quot;Rodney are you alright?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Same headache Twilight, it's fine. Hang on a minute, I need to be careful draining this gem.&quot; Since the gem was packed to the brim with so much magic it was impossible to instantly siphon small parts of it. The safest method would be to continuously siphon minute amounts which was even more difficult with my headache. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Hang on, I got a better idea.'</span></p><p><i>'What are you on about now?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Seeing as it's a bit of a risk to drain the gem, why don't we just tag the spell on the gem itself.'</span></p><p><i>'Turn it into an enchantment?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'It's easy enough, at the core it's still a passive spell.'</span></p><p><i>'But then how is it suppose to-OH!'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Exactly.'</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later.....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney,&quot; Twilight called out irritably. </p><p>&quot;Sorry, sorry.&quot; I replied with my eyes closed as I continue to weave and modify the spell. &quot;Some last minute adjustments is all. Aaaand.............................................................&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rod-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Done!&quot; I opened my eyes and let out a sigh as I flexed my legs a bit to work out the soreness from standing still for the whole while. Making the adjustments to work on an independent source of magic was simple enough, it was reworking critical areas and adding more changes to make the whole thing work properly that too so much time, especially with the levitation spell.</p><p>&quot;Right, sorry about the wait Twilight. Let's do this.&quot; I held the gem with both hands just below my belly and began to work and apply the enchantment onto it. </p><p>It was hard to notice it at first seeing as the gem was shining in a color similar to my magic, but as the enchantment slowly took hold the azure fire grew and intensified making it easier to see as it covered and wrap around the gem. Once the enchantment finally took control I felt the gem's weight lightened as it began to lift and float in front of me. The azure fire seemed to dim the intensity of the light making it easier to gaze at, though I still had to squint to do so. What's more the many different hues of blue that shined around now dance about in reflection to the flame’s movement creating a supernatural light show around me. I noticed Twilight staring at the scenery around me open mouthed completely entranced by the spectacle. </p><p>&quot;What do you think Twilight?&quot; I asked in a shout jolting her back to reality. </p><p>&quot;What did you do? I thought you were making a shield.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a shield,&quot; I answered pointing to the floating gem in front of me, I smiled seeing her confused face. &quot;Go ahead, throw something at me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure? I don't want to accidentally hurt you or-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just throw a pebble or something, I'd only get a bruise in case something goes wrong.&quot; She hesitated and paused but her horn eventually began to glow as a small sized rock floated from the ground next to her. </p><p>&quot;Rodney are you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;C'mon Twily!&quot; I shouted provokingly while patting my chest. &quot;Right at the center! Shouldn't be too hard even for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, alright then. Here goes.&quot; The pebble suddenly flew high up and arced directly at me at a pathetically slow speed, it took more than two seconds for it to travel the seven meters between Twilight and I. As expected the floating gem didn't react as the pebble sailed past it and struck me on the chest harmlessly. At least she hit me dead center.</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot; I asked in a flat tone. &quot;C’mon Twily!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney I don't-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have a stupid haircut!&quot;</p><p>Twilight looked at me both surprised and confused at my sudden outburst, &quot;Rodney wha-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your ears are gigantic!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not going to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Celestia has a fat flank!&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[At Canterlot Castle....]</p></div><p>&quot;Which is when I decided to visit the Everfree myself and conduct....,&quot; Inquest stopped mid sentence once he noticed Celestia's sudden change in demeanor. &quot;Is everything alright Celestia?&quot; </p><p>Following Inquest's gaze Shining approached the white alicorn who had suddenly looked enraged. &quot;Princess?&quot; he asked hesitantly.</p><p>&quot;That's odd,&quot; she replied in a puzzled tone, &quot;I have a sudden urge to send a monkey to the moon.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Back at the lakeside....]</p></div><p>&quot;Rodney, if you're trying to provoke me into-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Books are a waste of paper!&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot; 	</p><p>I smiled smugly and took a pose with both hands stretched out wide to the side, &quot;What's the matter? You mad? Come at me Twily!&quot; </p><p>Without a word of warning her horn suddenly flared up with magic as a pebble flew straight from the ground directly at me. The speed of the projectile caught me off guard and I nearly jumped away out of pure reflex, luckily I didn’t have to. Quicker than I could follow the burning gem flew and intercepted the rock only a few feet in front of me, there was a flash of blue as the pebble collided with the gem before it fell to the ground.</p><p>&quot;What do you think Twily?&quot; I asked proudly. &quot;My levitation, propulsion, and shield spell brought together and controlled by a single core enchantment. The enchantment tracks incoming projectiles, those it deems dangerous, and calculates an intercept course which it then relays to the levitation spell. The shield spell would activate just before impact protecting the gem while the propulsion spell negates the force behind it by creating an equal force against it. All working in unison and completely automatic without any control from me.&quot; With a smile I folded both arms across my chest, &quot;You gotta admit that's pretty impressive. And the best part of it all is that the whole thing works from the magic inside the gem and not me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rodney that's-I...you! Three spells!?&quot; Twilight's stuttering and half-finished sentences was expected, her mind was probably busy processing new information and racing with brand new ideas for her thesis.</p><p>&quot;Mind giving it a test run Twily? I still think books are a waste of space.&quot; Twilight froze mid rambling and glared at me angrily. I held a hand out and gestured the most famous and universally known taunt in existence, even ponies like Twilight seem to understand what it meant.</p><p>With renewed vigor Twilight's horn glowed brighter than before as several more tiny rocks flew from the ground around her towards various parts of my body. Truth be told I didn't believe the gem would be able to intercept every single one of them seeing how fast Twilight was firing two more even before the first reached me. Which is why it was a great surprise when the gem flew about in impossible speed intercepting each and every one of them, from my perspective the gem flew from one spot to another almost instantaneously. Only now did I realize that by having the enchantment work on its own without my control it could operate without human error, allowing it to control each of the three spells perfectly at computer like speed. </p><p>The gem continue to fly around and about creating a trail of blue light in my vision while the area in front of me kept flashing in blue light as pebbles fell like rain. I noticed Twilight's body posture was starting to sag a bit as her magic reserve started to deplete, I doubt she'd recover all her magic with only a single nap. &quot;Much as I'd like to continue and further observe my new spell through practical testing, I'm not looking forward to carry you all the way back to Ponyville. So why don't we call it quits?&quot;</p><p>&quot;After what you said!? I don’t think so! Besides, I've already figured out flaws in your...what do you call it anyway?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Honestly I sorta made it on the spot so I haven't given that much thought. I suppose <i>sentinel</i> works for now. And what flaws?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They're quite obvious actually, I doubt it'll stop something like fire or a giant boulder.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which you won't test out I hope?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not don't be silly. There's another, more obvious weakness I can exploit.&quot; Twilight's horn glowed once again but instead of sending the pebbles flying at me two floated upwards to hang in the air. &quot;Fast as your sentinel is, it still can't be in two places at the same time.&quot; </p><p>Suddenly both rocks flew at me at the same time, one headed towards my right leg while the other went for my left shoulder. Twilight's reasoning was true, there was no way the gem would be able to stop both projectiles if they came at me in sync. Much to my surprise the gem simply froze in between both projectiles letting both rocks to hit me. </p><p>&quot;Ah! What the hell?&quot; I shouted more out of confusion than pain. I looked at the gem in confusion for a few seconds before I figured out the problem, the enchantment was never programmed to face a scenario like that so it tried to intercept both pebbles at once. Basically it tried to fly in two opposite directions at the same time. </p><p>&quot;Well this thing is useless,&quot; I said disappointed. &quot;I'll have to make some major overhauling before it's-&quot; I froze mid speech once I gazed back to Twilight to see at least thirty tiny pebbles floating above her while more kept rising from the ground. It looked like there was a massive swarm of purple fireflies flying around her while she smiled at me with a look screaming of ill intent. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/6bcc797a3419c730a2d92c6b6f4047d24fd383ed?url=http%3A%2F%2Fth05.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2FPRE%2Ff%2F2012%2F053%2Fb%2F4%2Ftwilight_sparkle_reap_by_jlryan-d4qneq6.png" /></p></div><p>&quot;Twilight,&quot; I spoke nervously.</p><p>&quot;Yes Rodney?&quot; she replied in a sweet tone. </p><p>I raised both hands and smiled, &quot;You know those things I said before wasn't true right?&quot; I took a step back. &quot;I love every single book you lent me, read them every night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know.&quot; Twilight took a step forward. </p><p>&quot;So no hard feelings?&quot; I took two steps back.</p><p>&quot;Oh of course not.&quot; Twilight took two steps forward. </p><p>&quot;..........There's no way I can change your mind huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope.&quot; </p><p>I ran. </p><p>She chased.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[In Canterlot Castle.....]</p></div><p>&quot;...and that is why I have summoned you Crea. I ask that you travel to the Everfree in hopes of tracking and finding the <i>other</i> visitor.&quot; Celestia paused for a moment giving Crea time to process what she just learned. So far throughout the entire conversation the gryphon had remained expressionless and difficult to read even when they talked about Rodney. </p><p>After their meeting in the throne room, all three ponies and gryphon moved to one of the more casual rooms, but considering they were still in the castle the term 'casual' became somewhat moot. The room was decorated with expensive paintings and miniature sculptures with large pillows covering the floor near the walls, the only difference was how numerous they were. With the guards standing outside the room only Crea, Inquest, Shining and Celestia herself were present. </p><p>&quot;What do you say Crea? Would you accept this task?&quot;</p><p>Showing the first sign of expression since the conversation started the gryphon let out a long sigh looking unsure and hesitant, &quot;You're asking a lot Celes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;True, but I have asked for your help in dangerous circumstances before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is different, I mean sure I've had my shares of thrilling adventures. Wild animals, poisonous jungles, even went all the way to the Dragonlands for that plant you wanted me to get. The only reason I pulled through every mission was because of one thing and one thing only. I was prepared.&quot; Crea rubbed the back of her neck and let out another sigh. &quot;But tracking down a completely unknown creature from a different dimension? Nothing gets you faster than being unprepared and nothing is more dangerous than the unknown.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand that there are unavoidable risks in this undertaking, however there is nopony or gryphon with skills and experience that comes close to yours. And I am not asking you to go alone, Inquest will be joining you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was afraid you'd say that,&quot; grumbled the gray unicorn seated across the room, furthest away from the gryphon. </p><p>&quot;I know you're busy with your research and projects Inquest, but considering what you two have accomplished in the past there is nopony more suited with Crea than you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ain't that the truth,&quot; teased Crea in a sultry tone.</p><p>&quot;More than that,&quot; continued Celestia, &quot;you are the only one other than Crea that can traverse the Everfree safely. There are other ponies with extensive knowledge of the forest's flora and fauna but not with your skills or experience. Besides, you were the one that detected this <i>echo</i> where an entire team of unicorns failed to. Perhaps you might find some means to magically detect and track down the creature itself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not likely but I see your point,&quot; replied Inquest. &quot;Although you have to consider the odds Celestia, for all we know the creature could have wandered off beyond the Everfree. Or we might just find a corpse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am aware, but we must try. If the creature is defenseless then all the more reason to pursue and quicken your search.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if it's not defenseless?&quot; asked Crea. &quot;What if it's dangerous and wild? What then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I would leave it to you to decide what steps to take, if it's too dangerous to leave alone.....&quot;</p><p>&quot;We put it down,&quot; finished Inquest in a flat tone. </p><p>&quot;No!&quot; scolded Celestia sternly. &quot;In such a case you will subdue the creature and bring it back to the castle, I will decided what to do next.&quot; Celestia let out a small sigh of worry before continuing. &quot;And if it proves to be <i>too</i> dangerous for you two,&quot; Celestia spoke in a serious tone, &quot;I order you to flee and return at once. Your survival is the highest priority, Luna and I will deal with the creature then.&quot; Celestia turned and looked at the gryphon. &quot;Your decision? Will you aid Equestria once again Crea Whistwind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh I hate it when you say my name like that, reminds of my mother. Yeah, I'll do it,&quot; she agreed in a resigned tone. </p><p>Celestia nodded gratefully to the gryphon, &quot;Thank you Crea, I knew I could count on you. Rest and eat well tonight, you must still be tired from your journey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'd better enjoy royal food while I can then. Mind if I raid your stuff for supplies Celes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Help yourself to whatever you need Crea, the castle staff are more than happy to help. I'm sure some of them still remember you.&quot; Crea gave a rather short bow before turning around and exited the room. </p><p>&quot;I suppose I should prepare as well. Suspend all my current experiments too.&quot; With that Inquest too exited the room and made his way towards his laboratories. </p><p>Several seconds passed by before Celestia broke the silence, &quot;So what are your thoughts Captain? You haven't said anything since we started.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't want to interrupt is all,&quot; answered Shining. &quot;And I agree with your decision, considering their achievements together I believe it was the right choice to pick those two. However, with your permission, I would like to dispatch several squads of soldiers to safeguard Ponyville. The town is right outside the forest and if this creature does wander beyond....&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would be a wise decision but be warned, the sight of so many royal soldiers could easily create a panic in the town. I'll leave it to you to decide.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two squads should be adequate to keep watch over the entire town without raising too much suspicion. Speaking of Ponyville there is another matter I'd like to discuss.&quot;</p><p>&quot;About Rodney I presume?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have received some worrying reports from the town. In only a few days he sent the town into panic, both involving my sister.&quot; Even though Shining tried to keep control there was still some anger in his tone. </p><p>&quot;Yes, Twilight mentioned both incidents through her letters. What do you propose we do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suggest we simply take him back to the castle.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I can't, for his sake it is important that he remains there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then perhaps a guard should be assigned to him at all times then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight is already in charge of him, however I do see your point. Is there anything else?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None Your Majesty, I'll begin hoof selecting the squads for the town immediately.&quot; With a salute Shining turned and exited the room leaving the monarch alone with her thoughts.</p><p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; hummed Celestia as she tapped her chin with a hoof, pondering the Captain's words. A sudden mischievous smiled appeared on her face as an idea popped into her mind. Her horn glowed as she lifted and rang a small bell from a nearby tea table, almost immediately one of the guards outside entered the room and gave her a salute. </p><p>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's a maid that goes by the name Shine Bright, I'd like to see her.&quot;	</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>AN:	I told you guys I'd bring her back! </p><p>With that out of the way, Happy Thanksgiving to all! I ask that you all pray for me and my kitchen for I have decided to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turducken" rel="nofollow">Turducken</a> for this Thanksgiving. </p><p>Considering the carnivorous nature of this endeavor I have decided to banish Pinkie way from my home. How did I banish a 'fourth wall breaking pony' you might ask? Simple.</p><p>I duct taped my TV screen and every other portal to the pony world. </p><p>Who knew right? </p><p>Duct tape. Spread the word. </p><br/><p>Oh and could you give your thoughts about Crea? I'd like to know what your first impressions of her are.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 27 - You'd know if I wanted to flirt with you<br/>Edited by tired Noxxels</p><hr/><p>&quot;Oh cheer up Rodney, it didn't hurt that much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it didn't,&quot; I replied irritably, &quot;but did you really have to hit me with so many?&quot; I lifted up my clothes to reveal my midsection which showed a great number of small red bruises around every side of my body. The sight of my polka-dot skin caused Twilight's lips to curl up involuntarily as she started to snicker in suppressed laughter. </p><p>I simply shook my head at her as we continue to make our way back to town as the sun began its descent behind us. It was never both our intention to spend so much time together, certainly not the whole day, but with the nap and everything else I suppose it shouldn’t be surprised. Like elongated hands the trees cast their shadow on me as I walked on but it would never reach me thanks to the glow of the burning gem floating beside me. Its bluish hue tainted the golden afternoon light around us as it hovered vigilantly like some supernatural will-o-wisp.</p><p>&quot;Is it going to follow us like that all the way to Ponyville?&quot; asked Twilight as nudged her nose towards the gem. &quot;Can you turn it off? We'll definitely attract some attention with it floating around in the open.&quot;</p><p>Instead of answering I simply held an open palm right under the gem, &quot;Command-line: Terminate.&quot; With a last bit of flicker the fire that wrapped around the gem disappeared, it froze in the air for a fraction of a second before gravity took over as it fell to my palm. Like removing a covering the light of the gem intensified as it returned to its original radiance forcing me to squint and hold the gem away from my vision.</p><p>&quot;Passive's react to certain scenarios and phrases,&quot; I explained as I held the giant sapphire to Twilight, &quot;just like you taught me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Command line?&quot; she asked with a cocked brow. Her horn glowed momentarily as she took the gem and stuffed it inside a small saddle bag filled with the books she brought earlier. Even with the thick fabric the gem's light was still easily visible though it now looked more like a stain, unless of course if someone got a closer look and realized its actually glowing.</p><p>&quot;Command-line interface. A user to compu-eh....never mind, it'll take far too much time and effort for me to explain properly. Just think of it as a key word that I created specifically to interact with my spells. The passive ones obviously.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a smart idea, prevents <span style="font-size:1.125em">any</span> accidents <span style="font-size:0.875em">if</span> <span style="font-size:0.75em">you</span> <span style="font-size:0.625em">accidently mention...</span>&quot; The rest of Twilight's words became a blur when my headache flared up again out of nowhere. I groaned and rubbed the sides of my forehead trying desperately to somehow lessen the pain, the world around me started to fade to the back of my mind while my body started to move on auto pilot.</p><p>&quot;Rodney!&quot; Hearing both my name and Twilight's shouting voice jolted me back into reality, the first thing I noticed was the rough dark brown bark of the giant tree standing only a step away in front of me. I shook my head hoping to clear my mind but the sudden movement only made it worse as I felt a small sense of vertigo.</p><p>&quot;Weren't you paying attention at all?&quot; she asked worriedly as she cantered up next to me. &quot;Is it the headache from before?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry about it Twily, my mind just wandered a bit. It's nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure? It could be serious.&quot; Twilight eyed me up and down probably expecting I was about to keel over or something. “It’s possible you’re suffering from exposure to foreign elements in Equestria. Or maybe-”</p><p>&quot;Twilight I'm fine,&quot; I assured her with a firmer tone.  I turned and made my way back on the path to the town. &quot;It's just a hangover.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You've been drinking?&quot; she asked in a surprised tone.</p><p>&quot;Does that bother you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not really, just surprised you found the bar so quickly. The Bronze Sky is one of Ponyville's little dirty secret so only a few actually know about it. Even less are regulars. I only found out about it around six months ago from Rainbow Dash.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>One of?</i>&quot; I asked with a smile hoping to veer the subject away from my headache. &quot;I guess Ponyville isn't all sunshine and rainbows as I thought it was. Still, is drinking really that bad?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It depends, it's quite normal and openly accepted in cities like Los Pegasus, even Centerlot has one or two establishments that serve similar beverages. The real problem is with ponies becoming inebriated and embarrassing themselves, even cause property damage if they're not careful. There's even a law that forbids any pegasus to fly after drinking for obvious reasons. Along with the addiction everypony in general view it in harsh light, while somepony ask for a stronger law against it others even wish for prohibition.&quot;</p><p><i>'So just like the olden stigma from back home then.'</i></p><p>&quot;I'm surprised Bronze could keep his bar in business with such a short list of customers, maintaining a bar like that can't be easy. With the way it looked he must’ve invested a lot of bits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked Twilight in a confused tone. &quot;Bronze Sky is one of Ponyville’s richer pony. He’s a very skilled smithpony and runs the only metal shop in town, the only other store that deals in similar merchandise is all the way in Centerlot.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I guess that partially explains the giant shield on the wall.'</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'The real question is: why he even has one? Or why is it so worn out with use? Looked like it went through hell and back.'</span></p><p>&quot;Odd, he never mentioned anything about that. Then what about his bar? His mark is a flying beer mug isn’t it? Isn’t a mark some calling for you ponies?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not quite sure, but I think it's just a hobby or a side business he likes to have. Not everypony can make a living with what they love. What I do know is that he's an exceptional smithpony and does amazing work in just about anything to do with metalworking. In the day he tends to his shop and takes in orders from almost everypony, even custom ones. I suppose that's one reason why the town tolerates his bar.&quot; With a smile Twilight looked up at me and asked, &quot;Care to guess what his shop is called?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it the Bronze Sky?&quot; I answered humorously.</p><p>&quot;Close, it's actually the Sky Bronze. He even uses it as a brand name for his merchandise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That pony doesn't have a lot of naming sense huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Imagine if he had to name his children, heck I even feel sorry for his pet.&quot; As if on cue, both Twilight and I looked at each other before bursting out in giggles and laughter just as we made the last turn on the road towards town. Soon the dirt road abruptly became stone pavements indicating we’ve entered the town’s perimeter.</p><p>Twilight and I continued on traveling into town together for the first few blocks before we said our goodbyes, with Twilight making me promise a second time to visit her should my headache worsen. I thought about asking her for a dose of magic but seeing as Twilight’s magic was stored up in the gem there’s really no point in asking her. So with 'Sense' alone I carefully drained the gem inside her saddle bag to my full before we went our separate ways, Twilight down another street to her tree house, or house tree, and I down another. I had gone a few meters when my stomach suddenly reminded me of how little I ate, other than breakfast I haven't eaten anything at all. With hunger driving my legs forward it didn't take much time for me to reach the boutique, I had practically jogged the whole way.</p><p>&quot;I'm back!&quot; I hollered over the ringing bell as I pushed the front door open.</p><p>&quot;Over here Rodney.&quot; I followed Rarity's voice and headed over to the kitchen and almost drooled as I breathed in the many different aromas. Rarity as usual showed great control with her magic as she so easily managed several pots and pans all at once with hardly any effort. Sweetie Belle on the other hand was zipping back and forth trying to set up the table carrying plates and cup around one by one with curled lips.</p><p>&quot;Rodney did you spent the entire day with Twilight?&quot; asked Rarity as she turned around to see me. No matter how many times I’ve seen it, being able to control a spell without line of sight still impresses the hell out of me, as if to show off she even whisked one of the dishes in the air like a pro. </p><p>&quot;I did. One thing led to another, Twilight spent all her magic and we ended up taking a nap.&quot; I moved towards the dining table and helped Sweetie Belle set things up seeing as she was got tired of picking one plate at a time and tried lifting several at once. Knowing her unusually prone she was to complete and total destruction.</p><p>&quot;Twilight ran out of magic?&quot; Rarity asked in a surprised tone. &quot;My goodness Rodney, Twilight is one of the most powerful unicorns in Equestria.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm aware, and don't worry we didn't do anything dangerous.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'We just charged a sapphire with enough firepower to blow up half the town then gave it to a pony who's gonna poke around with it.'</span></p><p><i>'Details.'</i></p><p>&quot;I'll take your word for it. Why don't you clean yourself up, dinner ought be ready by then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose.&quot; Making sure there’d be a kitchen to return to I took most of the largest and heaviest plates to the table leaving Sweetie Belle to deal with the easier tasks before leaving the kitchen.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Sometime later....]</p></div><p>Dinner went by as usual with Sweetie Belle leading the conversation, much like any child she greatly exaggerated her crusading adventures at the farm with Applebloom and Scootaloo. More than once I had to suppress the urge to laugh when the story got so out of hand it became hilarious to listen. Even though I’ve only spent a single day with all three, some of the stuff they tried to do around the farm sound almost plausible. I’m starting to question the wisdom of letting these three get together all the time.</p><p>For myself dinner went by rather quickly, especially considering how hungry I was and how fast I ate. Though Sweetie Belle certainly enjoyed the sight of me stuffing my face with gusto, Rarity however kept looking at me disapprovingly though she couldn’t really do anything about it. Contrary to popular belief it is quite possible to eat like a pig yet remain civil, you just have to do everything quicker.</p><p>&quot;I must say Rarity,&quot; I began while cleaning the last plate over by the sink, &quot;you are a mare of many skills. The very idea of going vegetarian for the rest of my life will most likely kill me outright, but at least it’ll be your cooking.&quot; I looked back to see the ivory unicorn sip her tea behind by the kitchen table. &quot;I might actually miss it if I ever go back home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Had I not known you better I could have sworn that was your attempt at flattery.&quot;</p><p>I smiled mischievously at her. &quot;Believe me, you'd know if I wanted to flirt with you. But seeing as Sweetie Belle might still be awake upstairs I rather not risk mentally scaring her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh dear, it almost sounds as if you're suggesting something indecent,&quot; she replied teasingly.</p><p>&quot;Don’t worry, I'll have to be seriously hammered to even consider that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Hammered?</i>&quot;</p><p>&quot;Drunk. Like royally drunk.&quot; Though I never meant anything by that, Rarity seemed peeved by that remark.</p><p>&quot;Are you insinuating that somepony must be intoxicated to even consider courting me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hardly, <i>anypony</i> would consider you beautiful, even I can tell that much. But as a human, that's exactly what I'm saying.&quot; With the last plate cleaned and dried I joined Rarity in the table and took my own cup of tea she prepared earlier. I could tell Rarity was about to push the topic further but I really wasn't looking forward conversing about human to pony relationships.</p><p>&quot;Since I'm currently on the spotlight,&quot; I quickly continued before she could, &quot;Twilight told me she explained a bit about my abilities after that incident with the fire ruby.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She did when I continued to press her for an explanation, I was after all also a victim. But if you worry that I would divulge-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not, Twilight told me you like to gossip about but she also had faith you wouldn't discuss something so sensitive. Otherwise she wouldn’t have told you in the first place.&quot; I took a sip of the tea which to my pleasant  surprise had a touch of mint in it. &quot;Not that I needed to be told that, after everything you've done for me I realize myself you're someone with integrity.&quot;</p><p>Rarity raised a brow and eyed me somewhat suspiciously. &quot;It isn't like you to discuss something like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're right, I'm not. But my parents rai....raised me to repay kindness where it's due.&quot; I was caught off guard when the very mention of my parents brought my emotions to a turmoil of loss, sadness, worry and even guilt. From there my thoughts quickly spread to my home, friends and even my job. I began to wonder if they were still searching for me or conduct a funeral with an empty casket once they’ve given up. I quickly finished my tea by tilting the cup all the way back hoping to hide my expression. I nearly jumped away from the table towards the sink as I began to wash the cup as an excuse for time to compose myself. I wasn’t sure if she noticed anything but if she did, she was thoughtful enough to remain quiet and waited for me to continue when I'm ready.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'I warned you.'</span> Ignoring that comment I splashed some cold water on my face and desperately tried to quell the hurricane of emotion I was in. After what could easily have been minutes I turned around with a long sigh and returned to the table acting like nothing happened.</p><p>&quot;After everything you've done for me, I'd just like to set things straight is all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you wish to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do. You've more than earned that much. Now I'm not sure how much Twilight told you so I'll just explain everything.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Roughly twelve minutes later.....]</p></div><p>&quot;....the chains keep my powers in check, and myself included. Apparently either Celestia or Luna could pretty much sever my link to magic with it.&quot; I shook one hand in the air causing the chains to jingle. &quot;But pretty much anything magical I come into contact with still get's drained. Anything non living to be more accurate, which is what happen with your fire ruby.&quot;</p><p>Rarity tapped a hoof on her chin in thought, &quot;But what happened after? You were thrashing about on the floor screaming in so much pain. It was horrible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;From what Twilight told me my body and mind simply wasn't ready to hold that much magic yet considering I came from a world devoid of magic. Creates sorta of a backlash effect or something. I assume that I needed to train and slowly get used to wielding more magic.&quot; Again Rarity fell silent as she stared at her empty tea cup in thought.</p><p>&quot;That...doesn't sound right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Meaning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I'm not as knowledgeable as Twilight with magic, and everything else in existence,&quot; she added jokingly, &quot;but any unicorn knows the bases for magic. One's container for magic grows with use that much is true, but anypony could and able to hold as much magic as their container allows. And I've certainly never heard of anypony afflicted with anything like what you suffered through.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well...I'm not a pony, so I suppose that makes me a special case.&quot; I recalled one of my earlier session with Twilight back in the castle. &quot;From the way Twilight explained it she was almost certain of it.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Something's off.'</span></p><p><i>'About?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'How is it that everybody here has little to no knowledge of our physiology, especially when considering the hospital requires samples to learn about us, yet Twilight seems to have a clear understanding how our magic works.'</span></p><p><i>'She doesn't. She said it herself today that our magic was a complete.......mystery.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'There you see my point? How is it that she seem so sure of one aspect of our magic yet knows just as much as we do with everything else.'</span></p><p><i>'It could just be a guess from her, one of her theories.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Don't you think she would have mentioned it? I'm telling you, it just doesn't fit.'</span></p><p>&quot;Well, whatever the case I should probably be best if I label everything in house that's magical. Or store them somewhere safe.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm? Oh no need, I can tell what to avoid. Wait, so you're not bothered by me at all then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would be lying if I said it doesn't disturb me a little, magic after all is a part of everypony. But I did not become the designer I am today be focusing on flaws and imperfection, plus I've come to know you better. And you Rodney are not without your merits and virtue.&quot; She suddenly gave a light laugh, &quot;Turning you into a proper gentlecolt is still in my agenda.&quot;</p><p>I groaned, &quot;Don't remind me, I swear this one mare comes by the store just to see me. I think her name's Lyrka or something, keeps wanting me to scratch her head.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my, is somepony interested in you already?&quot; she asked teasingly.</p><p>&quot;We're not having this discussion,&quot; I said irritably before standing up and walking away.</p><p>&quot;Oh come now Rodney,&quot; pleaded Rarity with big puppy eyes. &quot;It's such a juicy gossip!&quot; I chuckled at the sight before making my way towards the stairs.</p><p>&quot;Goodnight Rarity,&quot; I replied in a flat tone before heading up for bed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 28 - Oo~oh I miss this taste!<br/>Edited by Noxxels and Al3xGuerra <br/>Pre-read by Al3xGuerra </p><p>AN: This chapter just might turn this fic into mature.</p><hr/><p>Anypony who has ever placed a hoof inside Canterlot Castle would undoubtedly be in awe by the sight, all the splendor, the polished floor, the numerous masterpieces of art and sculpture decorating almost every corner. All the while being maintained by an army of maids and butlers dedicated to serving their Princesses and to care for the shining beacon that is Canterlot Castle, the height of power in Equestria. Whether it was dust, trash, weeds or even a fallen leaf that drifted inside on the wind they would give chase with the dedication and conviction of a zealot. All except for one place, one room, high atop the tallest tower towering above the research wing. </p><p>With the stars still twinkling in the sky a cold crisp night wind crept in through an open window into the personal room of an infamous gray unicorn. Loose papers and scrolls littered the floor and even more were hanging on the walls each either a diagram or an equation followed by ramblings that only a fellow genius or madpony could discern. Everywhere one looked there were piles of books and tomes covering the floor with several reaching up towards the ceiling. The only traversable space in the entire room were a few pathways connecting between the door, the bed, and a large old wooden desk. Many of these books had nothing to do with magic: botany, soil conditioning, even baking instructions for Gustave le Grand's famous éclairs. Of course this did not include all of the pony’s library, his more valuable and priceless collection of centuries old tomes are hidden away in a different location, one that is only accessible by teleportation. </p><p>Atop a messy bed slept Inquest himself who stirred and shivered as the night air slithered across his body, even his fur couldn't completely warm him against the cold. With a groan his horn glowed with a single thought as he magically pulled the blanket to cover him. Immediately as it fell over him the cold seemed to evaporate and disappear as if the blanket itself was radiating heat.</p><p><i>'A self heating blanket, not a bad idea,'</i> he thought as he snuggled into the warmth. Inquest's horn glowed slightly brighter as he reached out and shut the window close with a thud. A window that has never been opened in over thirty years. </p><p>&quot;.......&quot;</p><p>His eyes shot wide open in alarm as he summoned a great amount of magic into his horn at the ready making it glow bright enough to illuminate the entire room. Before he was able to jump up to all fours he spotted a familiar large beak barely inches away from his face. </p><p>&quot;Feeling a bit cold are we?&quot; asked a large gryphon in a sultry tone. &quot;Why don't we keep each other company and warm ourselves up?&quot; Suddenly the blanket around Inquest's body tightened and pulled him closer until he felt the warmth of the avian predator's body on his own.</p><p>&quot;GAAH!!&quot; shouted the pony as he pushed the giant wing off him. With more force than he intended he pushed himself away from the gryphon and tumbled over the edge to land on the floor with a grunt. As he quickly picked himself up hoping to save some of his dignity, a sphere of light flew from the tip of his horn and hovered near the ceiling. With the illumination spell lighting up the room he shook himself awake and stared angrily at the gryphon who was looking at him hungrily. A very <i>intimate</i> type of hunger.</p><p>&quot;Crea! What are you doing here!? How did you even get in!?&quot; He looked around the room but nothing he saw felt out of place, even the papers laying on the floor remained in place. His horn glowed for just a moment as he checked the many varying spells he'd created to keep unwanted visitors and everypony from snooping around with his work. To his surprise every enchantment inside, outside and everywhere else in the tower we're all still charged and inactive. Any of these defenses would give pause to either Princesses, some of them didn't even have names yet. Though perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised, Crea’s own set of skill and expertise as a hunter was as legendary as Inquest himself. </p><p>&quot;Enough with the questions,&quot; she replied in a bored tone before she started crawling towards him in a seductive manner as her tail danced like a serpent about to strike. &quot;We should spend some time catching up before setting off to the Everfree.&quot; Inquest could easily see the predatory glint in her eyes as the feathers on her body instinctively fell flat to give the least amount of wind resistance. &quot;Remember those sleepless nights we spent together? <i>Aloo~ne?</i>&quot;</p><p>Inquest's pupils shrunk and his ears fell flat in fear, his horn glowed brightly as he attempted an emergency teleport spell to the safety of his hidden library. Even with a prepared target for teleportation Crea still proved to be far too quick for Inquest as she leaped and pinned him down with his back on the floor. With experience and discipline it was simple enough for Inquest to remain focused as he continued to cast his spell. It was common knowledge that a unicorn's source of magic and control lay in his or her horn and any physical assault against it would cause considerable pain, enough to break even the most hardened pony. There is however a <i>different</i> way to break one's concentration, and to Crea, certainly far more entertaining and full proof. With her limbs still pinning Inquest to the floor she bent over towards his horn stopping just centimeters away.</p><p>&quot;Crea NO!!&quot; pleaded Inquest the moment he felt Crea's hot breath fall upon his <i>very</i> sensitive horn. She touched the base of his horn with her long, thin avian tongue before she slowly started licking upwards to the tip. Inquest's whole body instantly became tense and started to shiver and twitching while his hind legs jerked erratically from the sensation. He could feel the rough texture of Crea's warm and wet tongue as it traveled the length of his horn in an agonizingly slow pace while her saliva trickled down to his mane. With his mind overloaded by the sensation the hold on his magic shattered causing it to escape like miniature fireworks from the tip of his horn straight into the gryphon's wide open beak.</p><p>&quot;Oo~oh I miss this taste!&quot; shouted the gryphon as she licked her beak. She dipped her head further down so that the side of her beak grazed Inquest's left ear and began whispering in the same seductive tone. &quot;Let's relive <i>all</i> those nights shall we?&quot; She wiggled her eyes at the frightened pony before diving in for the feast.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.25em">&quot;AAAAAAAAAAARRGH!!!&quot;</span></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Meanwhile....]</p></div><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; asked Luna as she stared skyward. Her ears rotated about trying to pinpoint the source of the scream which proved difficult to discern from the echo.</p><p>&quot;Oh give it no mind,&quot; Celestia replied with a giggle. &quot;I simply asked Crea to wake the professor.&quot; Luna stared at Celestia with a raised brow before dismissing the matter away.</p><p>&quot;Is it truly wise to send a mere party of two to the Everfree?&quot; Luna asked as she trotted to stand beside Celestia on the balcony she often used when raising the sun.</p><p>&quot;Be at ease sister.&quot; Celestia turned and gazed at the eastern horizon. &quot;You might not be as acquainted with the gryphon as I, but I assure you she is suited to the task. And I'm sure you are aware of Inquest's many achievements, I've been told you have spent a great deal of time with him over the past several months.&quot;</p><p>Luna smiled lightly. &quot;He and I share a great love for the finer arts of magic and his eccentric mind is filled with such wondrous ideas. I often believe him to be mad.&quot; Suddenly Luna's smile disappeared as she took on a sad expression. &quot;Truth be told, I enjoy his company merely because he does not seem to care for my mistakes. Everypony certainly respects me due to my station, but very few would look at me as I am and not see the Nightmare.&quot;</p><p>Celestia turned and nuzzled the dark alicorn lovingly. &quot;Be patient Luna, everypony will know the real you in time. The same way the elements have come to know you.&quot; Celestia chuckled mirthfully. &quot;I see that you have started to adjust you speech mannerism full time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It would help everypony to see me as I am if I were to talk differently from Nightmare Moon would it not? An idea from your faithful student, though I believe she meant to help me socialize better by 'catching up with the times' as it were.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very sound advice, Twilight is often wiser than most  of her age.&quot; Celestia let out a worried sigh. &quot;She would however make foolish mistakes over the most ridiculous notions, mostly due to her outrageous imaginations.&quot; She let out a chuckle when a relatively recent memory came to her mind. &quot;Did you know she thought I would send Fluttershy to a dungeon in a distant land?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Truly? The timid one? What had she done to deserve such punishment?&quot; asked Luna in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;Nothing of course, but I suspect my student had a hoof in escalating the matter. Remind me to tell you the whole story.&quot; Celestia turned her attention back to the dark horizon before moving towards the edge of the balcony. &quot;Now I do believe it's time for a new day,&quot; she said more to herself than anypony else.</p><p>She closed her eyes in concentration as she gathered an unbelievably immense amount of magic to her horn. In any other case the horn of the regal white alicorn would glow a yellowish color whenever she would use magic, but in this case alone her horn radiated with the light of the sun itself. For those in the Summer Sun Celebration lucky enough to be in the front row of the spectacle, they would feel the very warmth of the sun in the light even before the sun itself rose over the horizon.</p><p>The first rays of the new day slowly ate away the dark sky before as it spread like wildfire, Luna squinted against the glare of the sun as it slowly started to ascend in the horizon. Though Celestia would admit that Luna was far more artistic of the two, constantly perfecting the night sky like a never ending canvas, Luna could never create such a spectacle as the one she saw before her. Though she would not openly admit it, Luna felt a small tinge of jealousy for the sun's radiance. But unlike before, she had learned to accept such limitations and not let them fester like open wounds, she knew all too well who waited down that path.</p><p>Celestia let out a sigh as the strain of the spell started to ebb away. &quot;Is it too much to ask for something lighter to move?&quot; she asked jokingly.</p><p>&quot;Well...&quot; replied Luna with a teasing smile. &quot;Technically you are the embodiment of the sun itself, perhaps if you were to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Luna if you mention the word <i>diet</i>....&quot; interrupted Celestia with a threatening tone.</p><p>&quot;Perish the thought dear sister!&quot; shouted Luna dramatically. &quot;You are ever the pinnacle of beauty.&quot; Luna batted her eyes at Celestia with an innocent smile before turning around and trotting inside. &quot;Let us not tarry any longer, we are to meet with everypony in the hangar are we not?&quot;</p><p>Celestia kept staring suspiciously at doorway leading inside for a few seconds before she finally let out a light laugh along with a feeling of gratitude. It was moments like these that she had missed the most after banishing Luna to the moon, ever thankful to the stars for freeing her.</p><p>Celestia was about to follow suit but just as she lifted a hoof there was a sudden flash of light blue right where her hoof was about to fall. There was now a white rectangular object with enough space for a very large pony to stand on and a small ring of numbers arranged like a rainbow at the top with zero at it's center. It was all too perfectly timed and before Celestia could react her hoof fell on the object causing the numbers to spin in dizzying speed. The moment it stopped spinning Celestia's pupils nearly shrunk to nothingness as she stared at the number.</p><p>&quot;LUNA!&quot; screamed Celestia only to hear Luna's loud laughter along with the clip-clop of her hooves as she galloped through the hallway followed by the sudden frantic movement of her night guard as they tried to keep up.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Several minutes later, in the hangar....]</p></div><p>Shining stood alone by the large double doors to the hangar as he continue to wait vigilantly for the Princesses arrival. His lips stuttered as he tried to suppress an urge to yawn, even after all the years in service he still had more trouble getting up than the trainees. His ears twitched as the sound of several hoofsteps echoed from down the hallway.</p><p>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Shining gave the dark alicorn a salute once she turned the corner, his brow rising curiously at the panting night guards following her.</p><p>&quot;Good morning Captain, is everypony present?&quot; asked Luna as she stopped beside him.</p><p>&quot;Two squads from both cycles that I hoof picked myself are ready for departure,&quot; replied Shining with the tiniest bit of pride in his tone. Just then he spotted Celestia's colorful flowing mane just as she turned the same corner, Shining's curiosity was further piqued by her irritated frown.</p><p>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Shining gave Celestia a salute. &quot;Is everything alright?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Captain.&quot; Celestia glared at Luna which she kept avoiding. &quot;Just a small family dispute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...see.&quot; Seeing as it was most likely a private matter Shining thought it was probably best to leave it at that. &quot;Everypony except for the professor and the gryphon are all ready and waiting in the hangar.&quot; Just as he finished all ears twitched at the sound of frantic screaming and yelping followed by frantic hoof steps causing Shining and the guards to tense up in reflex.</p><p>Shining was about to send one of the guards to investigate when the old professor suddenly skidded into sight as he tried to desperately, and failing, to make the turn causing him to slip and hit the wall with enough force to dislodged the large painting hanging above. Despite it everything the pony just picked himself up like it was nothing, pushed away the art piece, and started running towards the alicorns with wide eyed fear. Shining had, regrettably, become somewhat familiar with the professor's wild and crazed behavior, especially regarding his experiments. But never had he seen Inquest galloping away with so much fear and panic and considering his many accomplishments, both in the lab and in the field, little would even faze him.</p><p>&quot;Good morning Inquest,&quot; said Celestia with a smile. &quot;Why are you in such a hurry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get that feathered beast away from me!&quot; he shouted as he skidded to a halt behind her before waving a hoof towards the hallway.</p><p>&quot;And things were just getting good.&quot; Everypony turned their heads back down the hallway to see the giant gryphon making her way towards them with a spring in her steps that it almost looked like she was skipping along. &quot;Morning Celes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Crea, good morning to you too. Thank you for your assistance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh please I should be the one thanking you.&quot; Crea gave Inquest a wink which seem to make him shrink further behind Celestia before turning her attention to the dark alicorn. &quot;You must be Princess Luna,&quot; she gave a quick bow before extending a claw. &quot;Crea Whistwind.&quot;</p><p>Luna was somewhat puzzled by the gryphon's laid back greeting, it was rough and done merely because she had to. For the dark alicorn a show for respect and position was something she often demanded, not out of pride and certainly not to because she believed they were lesser, but because it was something proper and earned.</p><p><i>'Then again perhaps such things are no longer held in such standard,'</i> thought Luna. <i>'There is certainly something appealing about it.'</i></p><p>Luna placed a hoof in the gryphons claw and shook. &quot;That I am. I have been told that thou, <i>you</i> have quite a history with our dear professor and a hunter of great prowess.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guilty on both charges I'm afraid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now that introductions are out of the way,&quot; interrupted Celestia, &quot;let us not keep everypony waiting any longer.&quot; Shining stepped to the side allowing everypony to pass by before his horn glowed a light rose color as he began to push the doors open with his magic. The moment Celestia started to move, Inquest’s horn lit up as a white translucent bubble suddenly appeared around his entire frame before being lifted up roughly a foot above ground.</p><p>&quot;Oh come on Inquest what kind of girl do you think I am?&quot; teased Crea. &quot;We're in the presence of royalty.&quot;</p><p>She passed by Inquest with a smile following both princesses and their guards as they entered the hangar. Inquest waited for a few second with his eyes glued at the gryphon's back before he released his spell and dropped to the floor. As Inquest passed through the doorway Shining saw a string of liquid connecting the base of his horn to the tip, he then realized that the entire horn and mane around it was completely drenched with the stuff.</p><p>&quot;What happen to your-&quot;</p><p>&quot;DON'T ASK!!&quot; Inquest cut it before he used a quick spell to clean himself up. Shining felt more confused that irritated as he stared at the gray pony before he too followed suit.</p><hr/><p>When Shine Bright was first summoned by name for a presence with Princess Celestia the first notion in her mind was punishment, that somehow she had been discovered or accused for enacting one of the many ideas given to her by the human. Considering how far she and several others had gone in their constant attempt to sabotage the Prince's daily life in the castle, the dungeon was the least of her worries. She could get fired. Shine nearly fell to the floor in relief when she discovered such was not the case, that Celestia merely had a task for her to do.</p><p><i>'Oh thank goodness, she just wants something to eat.'</i> she thought.</p><p>It is not uncommon for the Princess to have certain cravings once in awhile, most often for desserts and sweets that can only be found in specific cities or region. Most ponies in the staff see it as a surprise vacation and are more than willing to travel especially it's a popular location like Los Pegasus. There was even a list of ponies in the staff's public quarters that determined who would go on the next trip based on bets and favors.</p><p>It came to no surprise then how disappointed Shine Bright felt when the task was something else entirely. Her disappointment however was quickly replaced by confusion when Celestia asked her to live in the nearby town of Ponyville in order to keep an eye on the human. She tried to wrap her head around the idea but she just couldn't understand the reason behind it, as far as she heard the Princess's own student was charged with the task. If any other pony had asked something like this she would most likely refused outright, after all it meant leaving everything behind just to babysit somepony. The Princess however was not just anypony. The sheer pressure of being in the same room with the Princess alone gave her breathing problems, to decline her request was simply outlandish.</p><p>Though she felt fear and hesitation having to leave her home, friends and job; she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and impatience to see the human again. She believed it was simply because she wanted to properly thank him for his help, even though they were merely ideas it greatly improved her life in the castle as well as others in the staff. She dismissed the issue however seeing as she was to leave the very next day, between the packing, writing letters to family and farewells with her friends it left very little room for her to ponder about anything.</p><p>But now as she waited in the hangar there was nothing else to do but think, the uncertainty, fear and pressure had finally caught up to her. True it might not be permanent, the Princess did guarantee she would return and a place in the castle staff should things go awry which offered some solace. Not enough to calm her nerves though, she lost count how many times she'd paced around her stuffed suitcase in a nervous fit.</p><p>She almost fell into full blown panic when she trotted into the hangar expecting a single carriage for her transport only to see a large group of royal guards standing and waiting in formation in front of a royal airboat all prepped and ready for departure. About two-thirds of them were of Princess Celestia's day guard while the rest came from Princess Luna's night guard. Though most of them consisted of earth ponies, there were still a reasonable number of pegasi and unicorns mixed in.</p><p>She had thought and hoped that their purpose was somewhere else entirely, that it was merely a coincidence that they are bound to depart the same time as her. She attempted to inquire about their destination but everypony just stood there in formation with their stoic faces as they continued to ignore her.  </p><p>&quot;What have I gotten myself into?&quot; asked Shine Bright as her head fell low.</p><p>Her ears twitched as the sound of the large double doors behind her began to groan, turning around she saw both Princess Celestia and Luna making their way towards her. A sudden sense of alarm surged inside her the moment she spotted the giant gryphon trailing behind the alicorns, working as the castle staff Shine has seen her share of gryphons before. Most were guards to delegates and eventually her instinctive fear of them ebbed away, but none of them came even close to the sheer size and sense of presence as this one.</p><p>&quot;DON'T ASK!!&quot; Shine's attention shifted away from the gryphon towards the familiar voice in the back where she then saw professor Inquest trotting in looking far more aggravated than usual. The Captain of the Guard was the last to enter before the doors closed behind him with a thud.</p><p>Shine Bright nearly jumped up in fright as every royal soldier behind her suddenly gave a salute to both monarchs. Quickly composing herself, she paid her respects with an elegant bow as Princess Celestia approached her.</p><p>&quot;Good morning Shine Bright,&quot; she greeted in a pleasant tone. &quot;I do apologize how sudden and difficult my request was. It is not too late to turn down my offer, I'll think nothing less of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh it's no trouble at all Your Majesty,&quot; Shine quickly replied without a thought. Shine Bright mentally scolded herself for agreeing out of nervous impulse. It's not like she didn't want to help the Princess, after all she did choose to serve her ruler as best she could even if it's just tidying thing up a bit.</p><p><i>'Ah well, can't do anything about it now. Might as well do it right.'</i></p><p>&quot;Uhm, pardon me Your Majesty but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I'm not sure what...that is to say, exactly what am I suppose to do?&quot; Shine crossed both her front limbs nervously hoping the question didn't make her sound stupid.</p><p>&quot;It's quite simple really, I'd simply like you to keep an eye on the human for me. Just keep him out of trouble and the like.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I heard your student, Miss Twilight Sparkle was placed in charge of the human. A pony like her....I just don't-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand your confusion, it's true that I did place my faithful student to oversee Rodney. However she is still a student and as such cannot invest all her time and effort on him alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So...I'm like her assistant?&quot; Shine asked with a raised brow.</p><p>&quot;You may think of it as such.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But why me specifically? Surely there are other ponies more suited.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You underestimate yourself my little pony.&quot; Celestia gave Shine a comforting smile. &quot;I have a feeling you will accomplish more than any other.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the guards?&quot; she asked tentatively.</p><p>&quot;We do have...a situation of sorts, they are sent to protect everypony including yourself in case events take a turn for the worse. Again I offer you the chance to stay should you choose.&quot; A part of Shine Bright desperately wanted to just forget about it all and return to her normal routine. Then again, when has Princess Celestia ever personally asked her to do anything?</p><p>&quot;Well they are the royal guards,&quot; replied Shine more to herself as encouragement, &quot;and there certainly are a lot of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Celestia looked back and gave the Captain a nod before he started barking orders which echoed throughout the hangar.</p><p>There was an explosion of movement as every soldier started marching unto the airboat with most going below deck while a few took their positions around the ship. Before Shine bright could realize it a tall earth pony day guard had taken her suitcase and was carrying it on-board with ease.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry Shine Bright,&quot; continued Celestia. &quot;I have already sent a letter to my student. She will take care of your living arrangements during your stay.&quot; Shine Bright glanced at the ramp with a nervous gulp before giving the Princess another bow and making her way unto the airboat.</p><p>She shot another hesitant look at Princess Celestia which she replied with a nod before the ramp slowly started to retract away. Several ponies in charge of the hangar quickly undid all the ropes acting as anchors, with each restraint released the ship jerked about before it finally settled down and hovered freely.</p><p>Slowly the creaking and grinding sound of machinery started to hum from within the ship as the fin-like contraption around the ship started to move. Shine Bright gazed onward at the large opening of the hangar while the ship slowly started to gain momentum and sailed towards the open sky. The ship sailed at a leisurely pace as it exited the hangar as the cool air of dawn blew across the deck causing Shine to shiver as her mane flew about in the wind. Suddenly the hums and vibrations of the engine intensified as the fins began to flap faster and faster giving the ship more speed. Seeing as things were about to become much colder on the deck, Shine Bright carefully made her way to the back and down below deck all the while wondering what the future held for her.</p><hr/><p>&quot;A maid Your Majesty?&quot; asked Shining as both he and Celestia watched the ship start to shrink in the distance. &quot;Not exactly what I had in mind to keep him in line.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah but you see that lies the problem,&quot; Celestia turned to look at Shining. &quot;Much like a foal, I believe he'll simply disobey so long as we enforce it upon him. Besides,&quot; she turned and began to trotting towards Luna, &quot;I have enforced enough on him already.&quot;</p><p>Something about the way she said it didn't feel right, it almost sounded as if she harbored some guilt of sorts. Shining stared at the Princess with a raised brow before he started to follow her as they made their way to join Princess Luna who had been conversing with professor Inquest and Crea.  </p><p>&quot;Is everypony ready then?&quot; Celestia asked as she and the Captain joined the trio.</p><p>&quot;Ready as can be,&quot; replied Crea in a positive note as she patted on one of the straps that ran across her chest. Most of them were packed full of herbs and other plant-like oddities that stuck out the openings while others held thin metal containers, likely each containing a variety of potions for different uses. &quot;But do we really have to teleport?&quot; she asked irritably. &quot;You know how I hate it Celes, it just doesn't feel right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's just the after effects of being obliterated into a state of nothingness, riding a flow of magic that travels in the speed of light, and being reconstructed back into existence at the destination,&quot; explained Inquest in a humored tone.</p><p>&quot;That didn't help.&quot;  </p><p>&quot;What makes you think it was suppose to?&quot; Inquest shot a smirk at the gryphon who simply retorted by using her tail as a whip to strike at his flank causing him to jump with a yelp.</p><p>Luna giggle humorously at their antics. &quot;You should have invited her over sooner Celestia, I never knew they were so close.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps we should invite her over more often than?&quot; asked Celestia teasingly as she eyed the professor.</p><p>&quot;Why not simply ask her to move in?&quot; added Luna with a smile.</p><p>&quot;Alright that's enough!&quot; shouted Inquest before things escalated. &quot;Are we doing this or not?&quot; Celestia and Luna shared another light laugh before took a more serious expression.</p><p>&quot;Are you two ready?&quot; asked Celestia in a serious tone.</p><p>&quot;You know I could easily teleport the both of us on my own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We know you can professor,&quot; said Luna, &quot;but it is best that you conserve your magic as much as possible. We still do not know what you will encounter.&quot; Inquest nodded understandingly before he turned and looked at the gryphon. There was a silent exchange between the two as they looked at each other's eyes, one developed out of the many adventures and dangers the two have experience together. With determined faces the two turned back towards the alicorns.</p><p>&quot;We're ready,&quot; they spoke in unison.</p><p>Celestia and Luna's horns glowed brightly with their respective auras as they began to channel and weave their magic, Luna's night blue aura started to spread over the giant gryphon while Celestia's golden aura covered the gray pony. With a bright flash of gold and blue both pony and gryphon disappeared from the hangar leaving a small scorched area on the floor, a side effect from the amount of magic needed for long distance teleportation.</p><p>&quot;Good luck you two.&quot;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 29 - HE'S MINE!!<br/>Edited by <a href="/user/Hollyhock" rel="nofollow">Hollyhock</a> (formerly known as Al3xguerra)<br/>Pre-read by <a href="/user/Hollyhock" rel="nofollow">Hollyhock</a></p><p>And big thank you to Flutter Glasses for the cover art. It's amazing and so are you. </p><hr/><p>&quot;Rodney that-uhh! I don't think-ah!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's supposed to hurt,&quot; I said with a slight grunt. &quot;I did warn you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes but-nghh!&quot; Rarity's entire body stiffened as I pushed deeper into her body in hopes of hitting the right spot causing her to bite down on the mattress. Each time I poked and prodded she would bite harder and squirm under me with muffled moans and yelps, and not the good kind either. These definitely came from pain.</p><p>&quot;Would you like me to stop?&quot; I asked in a worried tone as I eased off for a moment.  </p><p>&quot;I think....I think that would be best,&quot; she answered between heavy breathing. </p><p>&quot;You know, when I said that <i>I'd do anything</i>,&quot; I started, &quot;I had expected something along the lines of ‘giving Opal a bath’. Not that I’m complaining.&quot;</p><p>Just then I heard the sound of light hoofsteps coming down from the stairs. I turned my gaze towards the disturbance to see Sweetie Belle who, from the look of it, has just woken up. </p><p>&quot;What's with all the noise?&quot; she asked with a yawn while rubbing her eyes with a hoof. Her sleepy-eyed look quickly turned to one of confusion when she finally got a good look. &quot;What are you two doing?&quot; I could see her eyes glancing up and down between me and Rarity worriedly. </p><p>Considering the position Rarity and I were in; she laying on her large victorian mattress while I stood over her on my knees. I felt a rather strong pang of fear shoot up from inside me as I expected her to misinterpret the situation, as anyone would have had they stumbled on us like she did. For a moment I thought about asking a Rarity to explain things herself, but knowing her she'll probably make things worse just to entertain herself. </p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; I started as I quickly began to remove myself away from Rarity and her couch. &quot;Earlier in the morning your sister came to me and asked if I could give her a massage which by the way I have never given.&quot;Sweetie Belle’s eyebrow rose up in further confusion. &quot;She seemed to have the trouble believing that and kept insisting on it.&quot; I turned to look at the fashionista who had just let out a long muffled groan with her head still face down on the mattress. &quot;Let this be a lesson to you Sweets, never let a complete amateur give you a massage. You'll only find pain and misery.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh...kay?&quot; she replied unsure whether to take my advice seriously while rubbing her head with a hoof which was just adorable especially with her bed-hair, or bed-mane rather. She was likely aware of rarity's love to be pampered, making it easier for her to believe every word I said. She looked at us curiously a second time before making her way to the kitchen. With that potential disaster out of the way I turned my attention back at my current employer still lying on the mattress in complete silence. </p><p>&quot;You ok there Rares?&quot; No response. &quot;Are you just gonna lay there all day?&quot; Still nothing. &quot;Not very ladylike of you.&quot; I jibbed lightheartedly. At that she stirred and finally lifted her face only to glare at me. &quot;Ah! She lives!&quot; I teased again in mock dramatic surprise. </p><p>&quot;Oh ha ha,&quot; she replied irritably before repositioning herself to lay sideways and flicking her mane back with a hoof which returned to its usual flair and curl. How she did that without any comb or magic was a mystery. &quot;You could at least apologize.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not when I gave you ample warnings in advance. You're the one who ignored it all.&quot; Now that I think about it she was unusually adamant for the massage. &quot;Why were so persistent about it anyways?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yes well, I had <i>hoped</i> that it will all work out in the end.&quot; I wasn't sure how to describe it, but there was something in her voice or the way she said it that gave the slightest indication that she meant something else entirely. </p><p>“Whatever.” I gave her a shrug dismissing the matter before hearing a sudden commotion from the kitchen, likely Sweetie Belle had dropped something. “I got it,” I said in casual tone, already used to Sweetie Belle’s forms of ‘accidents’. </p><p>With a ‘thank you’ from Rarity I made my way into the kitchen to find a spilled bowl of dry oats on the floor. What’s hilarious about it all was how I caught Sweetie Belle just about to sweep the mess with a small brush she had in her mouth right under the rug nearby. She froze in that position as I looked straight at her with a raised brow, now it was my turn to wait for an explanation. </p><p>“Eeeh....just making sure I didn’t miss anything.” She dipped her head down to peer under the rug. “Nope! Nothing there.” I rolled my eyes at that before making my way to crouch in front of her. </p><p>“Nice try.” I raised a finger and lightly flicked her muzzle before taking the brush away from her. “Go wait at the table Sweets, I’ll prepare breakfast for you.” Grateful for the light punishment she scampered off and climbed onto her filly chair while I easily gathered the scattered oats and dropped it in a bin. With that done I quickly prepared a bowl of hot oatmeal with just a bit of salt and a mix of raisins and berries, just the way she liked it. </p><p>“Here you go.” I slid the steaming bowl right in front of her which she immediately began to eat with gusto. “Careful now it’s still hot.” Just as I said it she quickly pulled back with her tongue poking out. “What did I say?” I went back to the kitchen for a small plate and placed small portions of the meal on it to help it cool down faster. </p><p>&quot;No school today Sweets?&quot; I asked as she began to eat again.</p><p>&quot;Ihkss HunPhay,&quot; she answered with her mouthful. I smiled at that happy to see how much she was enjoying the meal I made for her. </p><p>&quot;Right, SunDay. Which makes tonight MoonNight.&quot; I let out a sigh. &quot;Still can't understand why you name the nights when you already have one for the days.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well what do you call MoonNight then?&quot; she asked curiously. </p><p>&quot;Sunday night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's just weird.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're weird,&quot; I replied immaturely which made Sweetie Belle stick out her tongue at me. I flicked her nose a second time before turning around and walking back to the main store room. </p><p>Whether it's some higher power at work or just pure coincidence, SunDays in this world were just the same as back home, a day away from work and all that. Meaning I too have this day all to myself. I would have liked to spend it locked up in my room and tinker around with my spells. Then again the promise I made to Applejack and Fluttershy lingered at the back of my mind, most likely I’ll have to wait till next week for a chance to visit both of them. Unless I get lucky.	</p><p><i>'Though I suppose I could wait an hour or two before heading out.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Not really enough time to make any changes.'</span></p><p><i>'Probably, but we can at least brainstorm some ideas.'</i> I made my way over to Rarity who had returned to lay atop her mattress wearing red spectacles with a book floating in front of her. </p><p>&quot;I’ll be heading out in a while Rares, just wondering if you’d like me to pick up something and whatnot.&quot; She pried her eyes away from the book to look at me.</p><p>&quot;Thanks for asking dear but we're good on supplies and I already bought groceries yesterday while you were out. When should I expect you home?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very late, you don't have to prepare dinner for me.&quot; She suddenly gave me a disapproving look. </p><p>&quot;You had better not be planning to visit Bronze Sky's bar again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rest easy Rares, I just promised Fluttershy that I would spend more time with her. I thought dinner at her place would be nice. Though I haven't exactly told her I'd be dropping by, most likely I’ll have to drop by her place sometime in the day to tell her.&quot; Then something she said came to my attention. &quot;How did you know Bronze owns the bar?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please dear I’ve lived here all my life and it's the only bar in town. Besides I've had dealings with that pony before, mostly for custom made fittings I need for my ensembles, and he would almost always invite me over whenever I visit.&quot; She gave out a huff as she held her head higher. &quot;As if a lady such as myself would ever find herself in a watering hole like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He probably thought having the most beautiful pony in town come by will help popularize the bar. Or at the least attract your <i>fans</i>.&quot; I gave just enough emphasis on the last word to show I knew exactly what they were which she replied amused look. &quot;What, you thought I wouldn't notice a pony or two walking by the store a bit too often? How they try peering through the windows hoping to get a good look at you?&quot; </p><p>&quot;All in vain I'm afraid,&quot; she replied with some pride in her voice.</p><p>&quot;For which? Bronze trying to get you in his bar or the ponies I just mentioned?&quot; I teased. </p><p><i>'Should we tell her that some of those ponies were mares?'</i></p><p><i>'Nah her head is big enough as it is.'</i> She shot me another look and was just about to say something when we heard the hurried sounds of hoofsteps approaching the front door. Whoever it was started ringing and knocking frantically as soon as he or she reached the door.</p><p>&quot;Rarity is Rodney in there!? Please open the door!&quot; It took me a second or two to recognize Twilight's voice, mostly because I never heard her scream aloud in such an frightened manner. </p><p>I turned to Rarity hoping to get some explanation but from looks of it she was just as confused as I was. All the while Twilight kept banging on the door making it shudder on its hinges, fearing she would break it down I hurriedly approached the door and quickly pulled the door open. Luckily I had enough sense to take a few steps back when I did because Twilight had been leaning on the door as she knocked causing her to fall inside in a heap once the door gave away.</p><p>&quot;Twilight dear are you alright?&quot; exclaimed Rarity full of worry as she jumped down from the mattress while her book fell to the ground forgotten. &quot;What in Celestia’s name is the matter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why the hell did you try to break down the door?&quot; I added which Rarity seem to disapprove by glaring at me. As Twilight picked herself up I noticed how her mane was all ruffled and sticking out much like Sweetie Belle's which probably meant she had either just got up or didn't have time to groom herself when she did. Something Rarity quickly took note of as well. </p><p>&quot;Good heavens Twilight how could you go out with your mane like that!?&quot; A nearby brush glowed and floated over to hover above Rarity's head as she stood over Twilight. &quot;It's very improper for a lady to go about town with her mane-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forget my mane!&quot; shouted the purple pony as she pushed the brush away with a hoof. &quot;I'm sorry Rarity I didn't mean to shout like that,&quot; she quickly apologized once she realized her sudden outburst, &quot;but this is an emergency! I need to see-&quot; her eyes fell on me. &quot;RODNEY!!&quot; I had to admit, the sheer intensity of her look was downright disturbing. I felt a sudden urge to be as far away from her as physically possible. </p><p>&quot;Look if this is about my headache don't worry it's-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind that!&quot; Twilight cut in. &quot;You need to hide right now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha-&quot;</p><p>&quot;NOW!!&quot; Before Rarity and I could question her further Twilight lifted herself to stand on her rear hooves so that she could lean and push me back towards the wall with her forehooves.</p><p>&quot;What the hell Twilight!?&quot; Much as I tried I couldn't resist the combination of her weight, leverage, and pony strength. I was forced to constantly backstep as she wanted less I fall hard on the floor.  </p><p>&quot;I'm not letting somepony just take you away from me!&quot; she yelled which confused and worried me further. </p><p>&quot;Who's taking me away!? Twilight could you please just stop and explain what the hell is-whoa!&quot; Twilight suddenly gave a great shove which came too fast and too strong causing me to tumble backwards onto the floor. </p><p>It took me a second to realize I had fallen into one of the store's closets as several items like small rolls of cloth and bolts of thread fell on me. Before I could even get up the door in front of me glowed with Twilight's magic and suddenly slammed shut with a loud thud. There was a sudden clamor as I heard a multitude of heavy objects move about right in front of the door, most likely to seal me in my tomb. I heard Rarity shouting and yelling trying to calm the crazy pony and even a scream from Sweetie Belle before I heard Twilight's voice again. </p><p>&quot;No matter what happens <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">don't</span> let him out! HE'S MINE!!&quot; And with that I heard the sound of hoofsteps disappear towards the distance before everything fell silent. </p><p>In all honesty I was contemplating whether or not I should just sit there inside the closet and wait till all this craziness blew over, then again I'm not really looking forward to seeing this new side of Twilight. Slowly I pushed the door open and as expected it only went about a fraction of the way before being blocked by something on the other side. Still there was enough room for me to poke my head out just a bit to get a good look outside which meant I didn't have to blindly levitate the objects in front of the door to get out. For a moment I just stared at the unbelievable sight in front of me, almost every piece of furniture and object in the shop had been pushed and stacked up against the door. After yesterday's events I suppose I shouldn't be surprised how powerful Twilight is. Still I'm having a hard time imagining the amount of mental control it would have taken to pile up most of Rarity's furniture in a span of a few seconds. </p><p>&quot;Rodney?&quot; I heard Sweetie Belle’s small voice above me. I pulled my head back in to reposition it sideways since there wasn't enough room to turn, when I did, I spotted Sweetie Belle still seated on her filly chair atop the pile while holding onto her bowl of oats. &quot;What's going on?&quot; </p><p>&quot;I have no idea,&quot; I answered truthfully. &quot;Where's Rarity?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She went outside to chase Twilight.&quot; Carefully as to not tip over she looked down from her perch before sitting back up all rigid. &quot;Can I please come down?&quot; she pleaded with an adorable voice.</p><p>&quot;Sure thing Sweets.&quot; With clear view it was a simple enough task to levitate her and the chair down to the floor. I was pleased to see how perfectly calm she was behaving seemingly completely covered in blue fire. In fact, she looked relieved. </p><p><i>'Shows how long I've stayed with them I suppose.'</i> With Sweetie Belle safely on the floor I began systematically removing each piece of furniture one by one, at least the ones that would allow me to widen the opening and squeeze through. </p><p>&quot;Alright I think it's about time I get out of here,&quot; I said once I was finally liberated. </p><p>&quot;What!?&quot; shouted Sweetie Belle in sudden panic. Before I could ask what was wrong she leaped up and wrapped her hooves around my right leg. &quot;No don't go!&quot; I just stared down at her in confusion when she started crying.</p><p>&quot;Sweetie Belle what's-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight didn't mean it!&quot; she continued as her hooves tightened. &quot;She's only been crazy once!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't leave Ponyville!&quot; With that Sweetie Belle started crying loudly. </p><p>&quot;Sweetie Belle I'm-&quot;</p><p>&quot;NOOOOOO!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not leaving town!&quot; I shouted over her voice. Immediately her crying ceased as she froze in place for a brief moment before looking up at me.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot; I looked at her with a crooked brow as she slowly let go of my leg and rubbed the tears in her eyes with her fetlocks. </p><p>&quot;What was that all about?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...I thought you meant that you were leaving us,&quot; she answered embarrassingly. </p><p>&quot;Obviously.&quot; She gave me a small, embarrassed smile. &quot;Didn't think you'd care so much about me leaving.&quot; With that her ears perked up and she looked right at me with sudden vigor. </p><p>&quot;Of course I care! You would care too if your friend suddenly went away!&quot;</p><p>It actually felt nice knowing how frightened she was at the mere thought of me leaving her. I'm not usually the type to get all mushy about something like this, but after seeing all that I just couldn't help myself. I bent over and picked her up with both hands before pulling her close to a hug with her muzzle resting on my chest which she seemed to like as she began to rub her muzzle against it. </p><p>&quot;I promise I won't be leaving for a long time,&quot; I comforted her. &quot;And even if I did, it's not like I'll never come back.&quot; She looked up to me with her large adorable eyes. </p><p>&quot;Pinkie promise?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pinkie promise, though I'm not doing the silly dance,&quot; I quickly added before placing her on the floor. &quot;What do you say you come with me to see Applejack? That way you can play with Applebloom for a while.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Sure!&quot; she agreed happily. &quot;But what about the mess?&quot; True, it looked as if a tornado had hit the store. Most of the furniture were still piled up in front of the closet and it would take a considerable amount of time to properly put the back in place. </p><p>&quot;It can wait, I'm more worried about still being here for the second coming of the crazy purple librarian.&quot; Sweetie Belle giggled at that remark.</p><p>Once I found my bag of bits amongst the mess and wrote a quick note to Rarity informing her of Sweetie Belle's whereabouts, we quickly made our way towards the front door and out into the bright sunny streets. Still feeling good about Sweetie Belle's affection towards me, I picked her up a second time from behind which cause her to squeal in surprise before propping her up behind my neck just as she liked. </p><p>&quot;Won't you be tired later on?&quot; she asked worriedly, though I could hear her excitement.</p><p>&quot;Don’t worry, we're doing something different this time,&quot; I assured her. &quot;Just make sure you hold on tight.&quot;</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Won't this attract attention?'</span></p><p><i>'Definitely, but seeing as we've already met most of the townsfolk it should be fine. They have to get used to seeing my magic eventually, anyone who's got a problem with it can go screw themselves.'</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'About damn time.'</span></p><p>With one hand holding Sweetie Belle tight, I bent my knees and cast my magnet spell on the soles of my shoes causing me to rise and float just one or two inches above ground. One by one every pony around us turned their attention to stare at the filly riding a floating monkey with its feet on fire. Before any of them could question what was going on, I launched myself just as I would with a pair of roller blades or ice skates and whizzed through the streets of Ponyville. Every head turned as we passed by them, most scream and yelp in surprise while a few would holler greetings. As we make towards Sweet Apple Acres, likely in record time, I could clearly hear Sweetie Belle's loud and excited laughter enjoying the best time of her life.</p><p>Just another day in a world of ponies. </p><hr/><p>Inquest trotted about the clearing with his horn aglow as he tried his best to detect any remnant of that 'echo'. He could hear the many sounds of life in the forest all around but he paid them little heed, confident that he was safe especially with the current company he kept. </p><p>Soon as he and the gryphon arrived in the edge of the clearing they immediately began with a diligent perimeter check of the area of danger. Even without uttering a single word to each other they both fell into the practiced routine they had created out of experience and trust, and it took them considerably less time to finish that another team of two or even five would. Once they considered the area relatively safe they began the search each doing what they knew best, Crea looking for bent grass and broken branches while Inquest observed the flow and state of the surrounding magic with his own.</p><p>So far Inquest could detect the lingering <i>feeling</i> of his own myriad of spells he had cast the last time he was here, even a few from the research team that came before him. But just as he predicted there was absolutely nothing left of that alien 'echo', the rogue flow of magic in the forest had wiped it clean away. Had the event occurred elsewhere then it might be possible for the 'echo' to linger around longer, but even then there was no guarantee that he could use it for anything. </p><p>He came to a stop once his ears picked up the sound of feathered wings beating in the air above him. He looked upwards to see the all too familiar sight of the gryphon's giant body as she descended to the ground near him.</p><p>&quot;Well?&quot; asked Inquest once the giant gryphon landed nearby. &quot;Were you able to find anything?&quot; Crea turned from side to side examining and the clearing one last time before letting out a sigh.</p><p>&quot;A lot actually.&quot; Inquest raised a brow and waited for the gryphon to continue. &quot;I can tell you there were exactly sixteen different squirrels that passed through this clearing probably around daybreak.&quot; She stretched a wing to point somewhere to her right. &quot;A pair of manticores were fighting over territory around there about five days ago and I can safely guess there were roughly seventeen ponies in that research team that Celes sent. I can also tell which hoof prints are yours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what's the problem then, seems like you're able to read everything that happened here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did find one set of tracks belonging to some bipedal creature, it left some pretty unique looking marks on the ground. Most likely it wore some kind of covering over its legs for protection and traction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Afraid that's not the one were looking for.&quot; Crea let out another sigh at that.</p><p>&quot;Yeah I figured as much. It went to the edge of the clearing with Celes and a group of ponies, the other large hoofprints must be Princess Luna’s. But besides that I couldn't find anything that would indicate 'a creature from another world'. What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Same,&quot; he answered regrettably. &quot;There's absolutely nothing we else can pick up on anymore and nothing magically out of the ordinary either, well nothing besides the Everfree being what it is.&quot; Crea shot another glance towards the surrounding tree line keeping constant watch over the area before she continued the conversation.</p><p>&quot;I'm starting to question if there really is something out there.&quot; </p><p>&quot;So do I,&quot; he admitted in a whisper but still easily heard by the gryphon.</p><p>&quot;Weren't you the one that told Celes there was one?&quot; </p><p>&quot;I might have.....stretched the details a bit.&quot; Crea stared at his eyes with a slight frown. &quot;Technically what I could tell was that there were two rifts that opened here, and from what I gathered each led to a different world. We know for certain that one of these rifts had to be large and stable enough to allow a large living being to pass through into our world.&quot; Inquest let out a sigh. &quot;Considering the outcome there's a chance that the other might be just as large and stable, but in truth the only fact I could say for certain is the existence of this second rift.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we don't know for certain.&quot; Crea finished in a slightly frustrated tone. &quot;Do we even know whether something <i>did</i> in fact cross over the rift?&quot; The way Inquest started to avoid her gaze was all the answer she needed. &quot;So now what? Go back and explain there was nothing to look for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; Inquest quickly replied. &quot;Not without making sure for certain if something did come through. The mission has simply taken a slight alteration is all.&quot; Crea merely shook her head at him, truth be told this wasn't the first time the pony had assumed something and taken it for a fact. Which was odd considering what he did for a living. </p><p>&quot;Still we have no way of finding whatever crossed through, if anything even did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are correct, not by any of our usual means. But sometimes even the most impossible situations can be solved by the simplest solution.&quot; Crea raised a brow curiously. &quot;We could simply ask around.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who exactly do we ask? Unless you can make the trees talk...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come now Crea, you know best how watchful creatures of the forest are with their territory.&quot; Inquest waited for a moment giving the gryphon a chance to figure out his idea but seeing as nothing came he offered a hint. &quot;Tell me, out of the living creatures you know in this world which is most attentive, and violent, when it comes to territory?&quot; </p><p>&quot;An Ursa Major?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Close. But I was thinking of something that can actually <i>talk</i> to us,&quot; he hinted again with a small smile. It only took a fraction of a second for Crea to piece it all together.</p><p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; she immediately argued. &quot;Ah uh, no way Inquest!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you got any better ideas please share it.&quot; Inquest could see it in her eyes how hard she tried to rack her brains for some alternative or find a flaw in his idea, aside from the obvious danger. </p><p>&quot;N-no, but I'll think of something that doesn't get us killed!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Oh please we can handle one,&quot; he encouraged. &quot;After all we spent an entire month trapped in their land once.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And we survived because we're always in hiding! But now you want us to just stroll into its home, ask a question and hope it all works out!&quot; Despite her words of caution it was evidently clear from the glint in his eyes that she will not be able to convince him otherwise.</p><p>This was something Crea hated about the pony yet loved at the same time, how he would always be the first to suggested such risky and dangerous plans. Yet it was these ideas that led them to their greatest adventures together in the past. And a part of her truly did relish those moments which ultimately led to her affection for him. It's hard for a girl to stay professional after being saved over and over again by the same pony, and Inquest have saved her dozens of times  over the course of her adventurous life. </p><p>&quot;One of these days you'll get us both killed,&quot; was all she said before she allowed the pony to lead the way. </p><p>As they made their way towards the edge of the clearing and into the forest, Inquest could make out their destination over the tree line. There, roughly half a day’s journey, was a cliff and directly below it a cave, a very large and spacious cave. It was home to one of the world's most dangerous, powerful, and prideful living creature. </p><br/><br/><p>A dragon’s cave.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 30 - Daddy<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock</p><hr/><p>&quot;Not that ah'm complaining or nothin’,&quot; started Applejack as I took another shiny red apple from the sack. &quot;But are you sure ya wanna buy all these apples?&quot; The yellow earth pony looked both unsure yet pleased as I took a bite with a look of pure satisfaction. Instead of answering I simply placed an arm behind my head, leaned back against the tree, and gave her the largest tooth bearing smile I could muster. &quot;Gosh, I don't rightly reckon anypony falli'n for my apples quite like you.&quot; </p><p>She gave me a pat in the shoulders with a bit too much strength and nearly toppled me sideways. I didn't complain though, I just sat there under by the tree enjoying the cool shade with my third apple in hand. Next to me was a sack, roughly the size of a grocery bag filled to the brim with perfect, bright red apples. I looked away from Applejack and turned my attention back to the town, the hill I was currently on had quite the view of Ponyville. It would have been the perfect sight if it weren't for the giant zeppelin thing that landed in the clearing near the town center. </p><p>From what I could see at this distance the only form of propulsion that thing used was a pair of large fins on the side that worked like those folded hand fans. It looked like they tried to duplicate a ship's functionality but for air travel, which was obvious seeing as they simply tied a whole boat right onto a giant balloon. I wasn't sure if it was on purpose, a coincidence, or just myself but the design of the thing looked like a giant flying whale with a big grin carrying a fishing boat.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/a63956485b20dcebcc987ad23337eb064c844095?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc06.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Fi%2F2011%2F338%2Fb%2Fe%2Fcanterlot_yacht_airship_by_misterlolrus-d4i5yk1.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN: Something like this)</p></div><p>&quot;You reckon there's trouble in town?&quot; asked Applejack in a worried tone. Her question made me recount the events earlier today, particularly what Twilight said. </p><p><i>&quot;I'm not letting somepony just take you away...&quot;</i> Calm as I might have appeared her words kept bugging me ever since I left the boutique, and now this thing appeared. A large number of ponies had disembarked from the ship earlier today, though I couldn't exactly tell how many. From the way they reflected light it would have been a safe assumption that most, if not all, wore something metallic. The only ponies I knew that wore armor were the royal guards from the castle. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'You think they came for us? Maybe that exploding letter was a bit too much.'</span></p><p><i>'I doubt it, otherwise they'd have arrived a long time ago. No this is something else. But according to Twilight I seem to be involved somehow.'</i></p><p>&quot;Rodney?&quot; Turning to Applejack I realized that she had been waiting for me to answer. </p><p>&quot;No idea,&quot; I lied in a casual tone. I wasn't exactly sure why I did but it came out anyways, maybe I was somewhat intimidated by the whole situation. Didn't seem to work though seeing as she looked at me suspiciously almost immediately. </p><p>&quot;Yeh sure 'bout that?&quot; I let out a sigh. </p><p>&quot;There's.....a chance that I might be involved somehow. But I swear I didn't do anything wrong!&quot; I quickly added. &quot;I'm just as clueless as you are.&quot; I wasn't exactly a lie, more like a half truth. Before she could raise another question I got up in my feet and grabbed the sack of apples in one hand. </p><p>&quot;C'mon, I need to check up on Sweetie Belle and make sure she's ok. I did take her with me without Rarity’s permission.&quot; I lifted the bag over my shoulders and took another bite of the apple. &quot;You can finally introduce me to the rest of your family.&quot; </p><p>Without waiting for an answer I began to make my way down the hill and back towards the large farmhouse some distance away. I could almost feel Applejack glare at me from behind, but fortunately she dismissed the issue and moved to catch up. It might not have been a good idea to delay the inevitable, I had to go back eventually. But in the off chance that whatever was going on has nothing to do with me, I prefered to let it work itself out in peace and just keep my distance. </p><p><i>‘Who knows maybe it'll just blow over in a bit.’</i><br/>. <br/>. <br/>. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Meanwhile.....]</p></div><p>. <br/>. <br/>. </p><p>&quot;So....you're not here to take him away?&quot; Twilight asked in a suspicious tone. </p><p>&quot;No ma'am,&quot; answered Shine Bright surprised at the strange question. &quot;Princess Celestia ordered me to monitor the human and that’s it.&quot; From what Twilight could see it seemed her reaction and answer was genuine. </p><p>&quot;You see Twilight,&quot; spoke the ivory unicorn who stood nearby, &quot;nothing to worry about dear.&quot; </p><p>&quot;But the letter....,&quot; Twilight started now unsure but before she could continue the sound of heavy breathing came from behind her. Following the sound, all three ponies turned their attention to the source to see a purple baby dragon with green scales running up to them on two tiny legs with a scroll in his right claw. </p><p>&quot;Twilight! Wait!&quot; he shouted between strained huffs. He ran up to stop right in front of all three ponies and held the scroll up to Twilight. &quot;She's....she's not here to take him away,&quot; he spoke completely out of breath. &quot;You didn't...let me finish.&quot; Spike took a few more moments to catch his breath before unfurling the scroll. </p><p>&quot;As I was saying before you ran off:” </p><p><i>“In light of recent incidents involving Rodney, I have sent Shine Bright to take him off your hooves.&quot; </i></p><p>Spike was ready this time so before Twilight could cut in he quickly continued reading. </p><p><i>&quot;I understand that with your commitment to your studies, monitoring him might be too much even for you. I hope that her assistance will lessen the burden and make things easier for you.”</i></p><p>&quot;Oh....eh haha. Eeeeh....oops.&quot; With her mistake clearly pointed out Twilight began to blush slightly with an embarrassed smile. </p><p>&quot;Wait, there's more.&quot; Spike's eyes ran through the scroll as he read on ahead. &quot;Yada yada yada...oh! Looks like she's staying with us.&quot; Spike looked up from the scroll to the new pony in front of him before walking up and held his claw out for a greeting. &quot;The name's Spike! Twilight's number one assistant!&quot; Shine Bright, who had remained silent for awhile accepted the greeting with a smile. </p><p>&quot;Shine Bright, I eh, used to be a maid in the castle,&quot; she replied nervously. </p><p>&quot;Now I remember you!&quot; Twilight suddenly shouted. &quot;You're that maid that spoke with Rodney before our departure. Sorry for not recognizing you earlier.&quot; She held a hoof out for a greeting, &quot;Twilight Sparkle, though I suppose you know that already.&quot; Shine Bright took her hoof with a smile before turning her attention to the ivory unicorn. </p><p>&quot;Rarity, a pleasure dear. Now I do apologize for leaving so soon after we've just met but I really must leave,&quot; Rarity turned to Twilight, &quot;<i>somepony</i> made a dreadful mess back home.&quot; 	</p><p>&quot;I'm so sorry Rarity,&quot; said Twilight with her ears flat on her head. &quot;I-I didn't mean-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's quite alright dear, I've been thinking of redecorating the store anyways.&quot; Rarity let out a light chuckle. &quot;And now I have somepony to do most of the work for me!&quot; With that she trotted away towards her boutique with her characteristic elegant sway before disappearing around the corner. </p><p>&quot;Wait, if you're not here to take him away...&quot; Twilight turned her attention past Shine Bright to the many royal soldiers going about their business. &quot;What are you doing with so many guards?&quot; She spotted a few pegasi busy unloading what looked like supplies off the ship which most likely meant they were here to stay. </p><p>“I was hoping you could tell me.” Shine Bright followed Twilight’s gaze. “I tried asking but as usual they didn't say anything. In fact they didn’t do much during the trip.”</p><p>“Miss Sparkle?” came a sudden gruff voice. All three ponies and dragon turned around to see one of Luna’s night guard approach them from behind accompanied by Mayor Mare. From the looks of it she was definitely not enjoying this sudden development in her peaceful town. </p><p><i>'This can't be good.'</i></p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot; she replied with hesitantly. </p><p>&quot;If you would come with us ma'am, there is something I need to discuss with you and the mayor.&quot; <br/>.	<br/>.	<br/>.	</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[In the Everfree...]</p></div><p>.	<br/>.	<br/>.	</p><p>In times past darkness had been a common fear to many in Equestria. Nowadays few feared it the same way with many ponies taking leisurely night strolls to enjoy the cool night air or to view the stars in the sky. This was all possible because of the safety offered by civilization with its sheltering walls and community, however most still felt safer in the light of Celestia’s sun. </p><p>But not in the Everfree.</p><p>For the Everfree was one of the few places within the tamed lands of Equestria that remained wild and free. Where the rules of the jungle still held strong and true. Even as the sun pierced through the the thick canopy of the forest, it did little to diminish the level of danger. To Inquest, the sunlight offered little comfort for if anything else it created a false sense of security. </p><p>True, it revealed roots, rocks and many other small dangers in the forest floor, but it also stole the fear away. Fear kept one vigilant, alert, and alive. The sting of a Manticore's tail, the stare of a Cockatrice, and the bite of a Timberwolf remained just as deadly both in the day and in the night.</p><p>Inquest counted himself lucky that the journey had remained uneventful thus far, though that could easily change in a fraction of a second. He kept up his vigilance and strained his senses, both physical and magical, for any signs of danger as he continued to trot through the thick forest in complete silence.</p><p>Nothing could be heard from him even as he stepped on dry leaves or withered branches. There was a light glow emanating from all four of his hooves, a spell to muffle his hoofsteps that he invented many years ago out of necessity when he and Crea had to flee from three packs of Diamond Dogs. Who it was that angered the alpha of all three packs was still up to debate between the two of them.</p><p>Spells to create shields, darken the shadows, change the color of his coat like a chameleon, or to point out which direction was north were just a few of the spells that were available to Inquest. Some he created in preparations prior to heading out for an expedition, but most were weaved in the field out of sheer desperation of circumstance.Though he would never openly admit it, and as impressive as his spells were, in his mind none of them compared to having Crea by his side. For no spells could replace a companion who would willingly throw themselves into danger for his sake. </p><p>As a race of predators, gryphons had earned their reputation as a violent species making even the most feeble of their warriors a threat to any pony. As large and buffed as the gryphon was, many had assumed Crea to be the muscle of the duo. However, any who had taken part in an adventure with her quickly discovered that her true value was hinted at in the translation of her gryphon name:</p><p>Whistwind; the silent wind.</p><p>The old pony knew this all too well and despite appearing to be completely alone, Inquest continued to traverse through the forest with calm. He was confident that the gryphon’s sharp claws would come to his aid from any branch, brush, or even straight out of the sky with extreme accuracy and effectiveness, and if she should choose to do so; lethality. As effective as she was in dangerous situations, he valued her scouting ability to avoid danger more than anything else.  </p><p>However, there was something these two prized above spells and claws, it was their synergy. It was without a doubt their greatest weapon, that extra awareness that allowed them to share and communicate their intent with a single glance as if reading each other’s mind. To know where to move, to strike and act in perfect harmony. </p><p>Even a small broken piece of branch laying in Inquest’s path was a clear message from Crea. The way it was severed cleanly off the tree and twisted to a curve, it’s broken end pointing to the left while the other pointed towards a tightly packed group of trees. Inquest could almost hear her words in his mind;</p><p><i>‘Careful. Danger on the right. Stay silent. Move left.’</i> The message was just as clear to him as if it were written on parchment.</p><p>Following his partner’s advice, Inquest strengthened the spell on his hooves before diverting to the left. He strained his eyes and kept rotating his ears about as he made his way through the trees for any signs of danger. Before long he heard a low growl from his right. Peering from behind the cover of some trees Inquest spotted a large manticore grooming itself in a small clearing. The thick patch of trees kept the manticore hidden from view. It would have been too late to sneak away by the time he noticed the danger.</p><p>This level of synchronization was what truly made these two unlikely companions a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>So with a combination of subtlety and Crea’s guidance the two were able to avoid most of the dangerous creatures in the forest. Though it took them far more time than Inquest first predicted with all the detours they took along the way. It wasn’t much of a surprise then when he spotted Crea’s tail dangling from a tree a few meters ahead. </p><p>“Here,” the gryphon spoke softly before she threw something small wrapped in light brown paper. With his magic he easily caught and began unwrapping the object which revealed a sizable chunk of bread loaded with bits of fruit and berries. </p><p>“Thanks,” he replied just as his stomach began to grumble. “Hmm, didn’t realize how famished I was,” was all he said before he seated himself under the tree and began eating with fervor. </p><p>“Easy there love, you’ll choke if you keep eating like that.” </p><p>“Lay off me Crea....and stop calling me that,” he complained irritably between mouthfuls. “You’re not eating?”</p><p>“Already did.” Crea took out what remained of a large sausage for Inquest to see. It was one of her recipes, dried sausage with bits of onions and various vegetables packed together. Not lacking in taste, it also offered a high amount of needed nutrients and protein that could last them days if properly rationed. “Want a slice?”</p><p>“Sure.” With a sharp claw Crea cute a small piece and dropped it down. She observed curiously at Inquest as he started to eat the sausage and bread together. </p><p>“In all my life you’re the only pony I know that eats meat,” she commented which Inquest replied with a casual shrug. Though in truth he too would never have thought of eating the stuff were it not out of desperation. Being lost, out of supply, and forced to consume one of Crea’s kill counts as desperate. Of course he would never openly admit to, or consume such things in public, but he did acquire a taste for it. </p><p>“It’s not harmful to ponies,” he continued before taking another bite, “as long as it’s cooked then its just another source of protie-ukh!” Crea let out a chuckle as Inquest fell into a coughing fit before grabbing her large water container and delivering it down with her tail. </p><p>“I told you.” Inquest merely groaned in irritation before levitating the container back up to her. “I’ve been meaning to ask, how did you know about the dragon? I don’t suppose you know this particular dragon?” she asked, secretly hoping the answer was ‘yes’. </p><p>“Never met him,” and just like that her hopes were crushed. “As to how I know about him, well a giant flying lizard with a mass to flatten a several houses and packing enough fire to burn down a whole city tends to attract some attention.” </p><p>“You let dragons live so close?” </p><p>“Equestria’s relationship with the dragons is strictly a <i>‘leave each other alone’</i> policy, which is the only choice there is.” he added jokingly. “But to answer your question, dragons that choose to live in other parts of the world tend to be the gentler sort.” Inquest could almost feel the disbelief from the gryphon. “I’m serious, why else would they willingly live so far away? So they moved elsewhere for some peace and quiet. That or they can’t handle the competition back home.” He gave a shrug. “Whatever the case we keep a close eye on every single one that lives in Equestria and each gave their word not to harm any of the citizens to the Princesses. Even a dragon would think twice before fighting a pair of alicorns, especially when one controls the sun and the other the moon.”</p><p>“And you’ve never had any trouble from them?” she asked still not quite believing it.</p><p>“We do but it’s nothing serious. I believe the last incident involved a dragon that snores during its century long hibernation.” Inquest waved a hoof. “Didn’t know much about it, at the time I was far too busy with my flying carpet project.” </p><p>“You actually went through with that?” she asked with a light laugh. “Well at least you followed my advice and didn’t go with a broom.”</p><p>“It’s a suitable mode of transportation and everypony already has one!” he defended.</p><p>“Sometime I wonder if you really are a genius, or just plain crazy.” </p><p>“Crazy is only a matter of perspective.” Crea looked down at him thoughtfully while Inquest looked up with a grin.</p><p>“Yup, definitely crazy.” She let out a sigh. “Mother always said I’d fall for the weirdos.” Inquest ignored that comment and got up to all four. </p><p>“We should get moving,” he said while gazing at the sky. “We have about two hours before we start losing daylight. Let’s-” Inquest turned to look up at the gryphon but found himself alone once again. </p><p>He shook his head before departing from the tree back towards the general direction of the cliff side. All the while he began to recall every memory he had involving dragons in preparation for the encounter. Size, strength, and a fire that could melt steel, these were the dragon's greatest assets. In his mind Inquest listed spells of ice and water, of fireproof shields and anything else that could aid them should things go awry. Inquest knew from experience however, that no amount of preparation was ever enough when a dragon is involved.</p><p>Unlike before, it took far less time to traverse before, seeing as almost every living creature kept their distance from this particular area. Which was a wise decision considering what lived nearby. Without anymore detours or roundabouts it only took Inquest roughly an hour to finally spot the first of many signs of fire. Blackened carcass of trees stood tall like dark withered tendrils which quickly multiplied the further he trotted on. Eventually he spotted a small clearing just past the few trees in front of him along with a giant looming cave at the base of the cliff. </p><p>&quot;I really don't like this idea,&quot; came a familiar voice from behind. </p><p>&quot;Neither do I,&quot; he answered truthfully without looking back. He was all too familiar with Crea's habit to appear seemingly out of nowhere in his blind spot. &quot;But it's better than scouring the entire forest without knowing what to look for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I beg to differ, that idea has us alive at the end,&quot; she argued. Ignoring the comment, Inquest started to scan the surrounding area for any potential danger before venturing further. &quot;It's clear, I checked.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Let' not keep him waiting then.&quot; He moved past the trees and into the clearing leaving behind the still hesitant gryphon. There was a battle between her survival instincts with her desire to protect the pony, but in the end her loyalty and love won out as she started to follow suit. </p><p>Most dragons living within the boundaries of Equestria were quite tolerant of visitors, by tolerant meaning they wouldn’t burn ponies on the spot, however it was important that said visitors <b>ALWAYS</b> made their presence known. Dragons were notoriously protective of their hoard and it was vital that they did not assume that those who entered their lair are after it. Unless they desired a painful demise. </p><p>Knowing this Inquest quickly terminated the spell around his hooves as he entered the cave with Crea right behind him. The moment he took a step on the hard stone surface, the sound of his step echoed down through the dark tunnel like a doorbell causing both gryphon and pony to freeze in place. They waited as the echo started to die down when suddenly there was a sudden gust of wind that almost blew Inquest's mane off his scalp. </p><p>&quot;He knows we're here,&quot; said Inquest in a whisper. &quot;Seeing as he didn't incinerate us, I suppose that meant we're invited in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yeah, that makes me feel alot safer,&quot; she replied sarcastically. </p><p>They both made their way further in and slowly the darkness began to intensify until Inquest was forced to cast an illumination spell. The sound of hoofsteps and talons scraping the ground echoed about which really made Crea feel uneasy although she could easily handle herself in a fight. Not that she looked forward to tangling with a full grown dragon, Crea preferred a subtler approach to a problem. But tunnels and enclosed spaces like a cave made that entirely impossible, she could try hiding in the dark but then the dragon could easily flush her out with fire. In other words, she was entirely out of her element. </p><p>Without warning the tunnel abruptly broadened into a large cavern. Nothing was visible but darkness beyond Inquest's light. Knowing they were not alone he slowly intensified the brightness just enough to cover the whole cavern. The space inside was massive, enough for several homes to fit snugly with room for a garden. The only indication of the ceiling were tips of numerous stalactites hanging from above. What caught both their attention however were the giant mounds of gems piled up on one side of the cavern, each glinting beautifully to reflect the light from Inquest’s horn. </p><p><i>'Ok there's the hoard,'</i> thought Crea. <i>'But where's-'</i></p><p><b>“Well well, what have we here?”</b> came a booming voice. Both Inquest and Crea fell into defensive position on reflex. Inquest added more magic into the spell and soon enough they could make out the shape of the dragon as the light began to bathe him. </p><p>Hundreds of times the size of a pony, the dragon had green scales covering most of his body with a lighter shade covering the underbelly. The leathery wings, claws, and spikes protruding from it’s back were also of a lighter green. What attracted their attention the most were his fangs, rows and rows of sharp white fangs that could easily rip a manticore to shreds in a single bite. </p><p>Despite how frightening the dragon was, both Inquest and Crea could only gawk open mouthed at what they saw. The dragon, in all it’s terrifying splendor, was standing upright on his hind legs with an entire tree in his claws ripped out from its roots. He held the tree upside down with both claws and from the looks of it, was using the branches and leaves to sweep the cavern floor. </p><p><b>“I do apologize for the mess,”</b> he began with the same booming voice yet in an oddly civilized tone. <b>“I’m afraid I’ve let things go a bit too much, rarely do I play host to any visitors.”</b> He turned walked a bit to the right and placed his makeshift broom to lean on the wall before turning his attention back to the two. <b>“Well then, I suppose introductions are in order.”</b></p><p>His large, slit, yellow eyes focused on the two and each of them had to fight an instinctive urge to make a run for the exit despite the dragon’s unusual behaviour. Still, this was not the first time they had spoken to a dragon before and they had agreed long ago who would take charge in such situations. After a deep breath to calm himself, Inquest took a few steps forward. </p><p>“My name is Inquest, the current ‘Professor’ of Equestria’s Research Department and advisor to the Royal Court.” Despite the situation Crea noticed the slight hint of pride in Inquest’s tone. “My companion,” he continued with a hoof pointed to Crea, “is Crea Whistwind, an agent of the Gryphon Confederation on loan on behalf of Princess Celestia’s request.” That was a lie of course, though Crea certainly did a few missions on the for her government, she was never technically under their employment and certainly not an ‘agent’. But she had enough sense to keep her beak shut and trust that the pony knew what he was doing. The dragon stared at the two for a moment before he placed a claw on his chest and gave them a slight bow.</p><p><b>“I am Falnor, a pleasure,”</b> greeted the dragon with a slight bow. Inquest couldn’t help but stare curiously at the dragon, he had expected to do a lot of groveling and praising to get the dragon’s cooperation. Yet here he was having a perfectly civilized conversation with a dragon who had just bowed to him! A dragon’s pride is legendary and even if it was just for a greeting, for one to bow to anything other than a fellow dragon was unheard of. </p><p><i>‘Was he afflicted with poison joke perhaps?’</i> he thought. He dismissed that unlikely notion remembering that dragons have a natural resistance to such things. Even if he had rolled around in an entire field of poison jokes, it still wouldn’t be enough. But as strange as things were it was all working out for the best, so why bother questioning it. </p><p><b>“Now why, pray tell, would two such outstanding individuals traverse through the dangers of the Everfree to pay me a visit?”</b> </p><p>“Answers to questions and nothing more.” Falnor scratched his chin in thought before giving a nod and bade Inquest to continue. “Since you reside in the Everfree, you must aware of what happened several weeks ago.” Falnor let out a sigh which sent small spouts of flame to erupt from his nostrils making Crea clutch the ground harder with her talons. </p><p><b>“You speak of the event that took place in a clearing not far from here. Yes I am aware, nasty business that was.”</b> </p><p>“I’m sure it was. But did you happen to notice anything unusual in the days that followed? Strange creatures or signs that appeared in the forest?” Falnor turned away from the two to stare absently of to the distance, though from the look in his large eyes he certainly had something in his mind.</p><p><b>“The Kindling.”</b> Inquest’s ears perked up at attention.</p><p>“What was that?” The question went by unnoticed to the dragon as he continued to stare off into the distance in deep thought. </p><p>All the while Crea kept to herself in silence yet something about the situation troubled her. Of course being in the presence of a full grown dragon, even a well behaved one, counted as troubling. But her instincts kept poking at her ceaselessly ever since Inquest began to converse with the dragon. While trying to remain inconspicuous Crea kept glancing about the cavern hoping to spot if anything was amiss while committing the environment to memory. It finally came to her when she glanced at the pile of gems and how it appeared to have been shoved to the side. </p><p><i>‘Why is it all piled up there?’</i> she thought. Dragons always kept their hoard at close proximity and even would sleep on it often. Before she could think on it further her attention shifted back to Falnor who had finally snapped out of his contemplation. </p><p><b>“Sorry about that, I have a bad habit of losing myself in thought.”</b> Falnor let out a deep chuckle causing small flickers of flame to escape from his nostril. <b>“It comes with age unfortunately. But back to your question, yes I do know of such a creature. I believe it currently resides in a nearby town, what was it called? Honeyville? Pockeyville?”</b></p><p>“Ponyville,” corrected Inquest disappointedly, “we are aware of that one. But have you noticed anything else? Anything at all that stood out?” </p><p><b>“Can’t say I have,”</b> the dragon answered with a shrug. <b>“Things have been normal. So far at least.”</b></p><p>“You’re positive? Nothing that seemed strange or odd at all?” Inquest scolded himself as he noted the dragon’s sudden irritated expression.</p><p><b>“Of course I am!”</b> he shouted in a thundering voice that shook the entire cavern. Inquest and Crea warily took several steps back. <b>“Forgive my sudden outburst, but yes, I am quite positive. It’s just been my daughter and I going about our business. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened since the incident.”</b></p><p>“I see.” Inquest gave Crea a look that signalled it was high time they left. “I apologize for the disturbance then, your assistance is greatly appreciated. We thank you on behalf of...” Inquest’s voice trailed off as something struck his mind. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to pry but....you have a daughter?” According to the report he had read prior to the trip, this dragon resided in the Everfree alone. </p><p><b>“Yes I do,”</b> he answered with a large smile baring his fangs. <b>“Such a dear she is, my pride and joy. Though she’s currently asleep at the moment, luckily it seems that my little outburst didn’t wake her. She can throw quite a tantrum if disturbed.”</b> </p><p>“What are you doing!?” asked Crea in a whisper. “Let’s just get out of here!”</p><p>“Something’s not right,” he whispered back before turning his attention to the dragon. “How long have you and your daughter lived in the Everfree?” </p><p><b>“Since the beginning, ever since we decided to move here together.”</b> Inquest tapped his chin as he went through the file in his mind. He remembered it clearly stated that the dragon came to live here alone several decades ago. </p><p>“According to our records you came to live in the Everfree alone, somepony must have made a mistake,” Inquest lied as a plan formed in his head. “If you would be so kind as to give us your daughter’s name, that way I can personally update the records and fix this promptly when I return.”</p><p><b>“Of course, her name is....is....I.......”</b> Falnor scratched his chin in thought but all that came out were more stutterings and incoherent mumblings. <b>“It’s...it’s in the tip of my tongue!”</b> he shouted in frustration. <b>“Her name! Her name it’s.....I know her name!”</b> Both pony and gryphon began to move away from the dragon who now bore a pained expression. </p><p>“Daddy?” came a gentle voice. The dragon froze. The look of pain and frustration on his face suddenly shifted to a pleasant smile. His long neck curved as he turned to look at something behind him. Inquest tried to amplify his light hoping to catch a glimpse of this so called <i>daughter</i> but to no avail, the dragon’s massive body kept blocking his view. </p><p><b>“Oh, did I wake you?”</b> he asked in a gentle voice. <b>“I’m so sorry, go back to sleep dear.”</b></p><p>“Who are they?” asked the voice sounding alarmed. “What are they doing here?”</p><p><b>“Worry not my dear, they came only came to ask some questions. In fact it seems there was a mistake in the records. It says that I live here alone, isn’t that just silly?”</b> A shiver ran down Crea’s back as her instincts suddenly screamed at her. </p><p>“We’re outta here!” she whispered before lifting the pony onto her shoulders and making a bolt for the exit. </p><p>“I don’t like them daddy. Kill them for me.” </p><p><b>“Of course dear, anything for you.”</b> Despite the early warning from her instincts and using her wings to propel herself, she still couldn’t reach the tunnel in time before a large spiked tail fell in front of her. Turning around she dropped Inquest on the floor as the dragon loomed over them. <b>“I do apologize about this,”</b> he spoke casually, <b>“but you know what children are like. They’ll never stop nagging unless you give them what they want.”</b> He lifted a claw and was ready to strike. <b>“Now hold still and this will all be over quickly.”</b></p><p>Just as the living guillotine was about to fall there was a bright flash from Inquest’s horn as he overcharged his illumination spell. With a roar Falnor reeled back from the light as he tried to cover his eyes with both claws. With the dragon temporarily blinded, Crea took the air while Inquest galloped away in another direction. </p><p>“Keep him busy!” Inquest shouted as he tried to formulate some kind of plan. </p><p>Crea let out a piercing battlecry like that of an eagle which reverberated in the cavern before flying straight at the dragon. With him still blinded, Crea easily struck Falnor’s sensitive snout with her talons causing him to grunt in pain. He retaliated by swinging his large claws randomly through the air hoping to make contact, but it was all in vain as they barely came close to her. All that changed when Falnor’s vision began to clear up, and his strikes slowly got closer and closer. It didn’t take long before Crea had to focus entirely on dodging each strike and was nearly caught mid air when Falnor suddenly lunged forward with wide open jaws. </p><p>“I can’t keep this up!” she screamed just as another claw brazed her underbelly drawing blood. The combination of limited flying space and Falnor’s great size left Crea at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>In most battles Inquest and Crea would each play the role that suited them best; Crea with her speed and agility would distract enemies when they were either in groups or large in size and direct attention away from Inquest who would end the fight with a spell or ten. Inquest’s  large pool of magic and wide array of offensive spells was usually enough to handle most confrontations. Sadly a dragon was an exception to this strategy. A single powerfully charged  spell using his entire reservoir of magic would certainly cause great harm to a dragon, but it wouldn’t be enough to put it down. Escape was the only option here, problem was.....</p><p><i>‘How in blazes do I move that tail!?’</i> He could easily teleport to the other side or even right outside if he wanted to, but the complexity of a teleport spell increased exponentially with the mass and the number of passengers. He needed both of them to remain still and time to properly cast the spell, which unfortunately in this situation meant suicide. </p><p>“Inquest!!” Crea pleaded a second time just before diving under another swipe. Noticing that Crea was quickly running out of stamina, Inquest began to gather a large amount of magic until his horn glowed in three layers of color from white to grey. </p><p>“Cover your ears!” Obeying her partner, Crea immediately covered both ears just as Inquest let loose a bolt of white hot lightning at the dragon’s center of mass. Falnor let out a great roar of pain as he staggered back a step with both claws covering a large black spot in his green hide. To their misfortune the spikes on the end of Falnor’s tail that had struck the ground earlier acted as an anchor which helped him retain his balance. </p><p>The thunderous sound that came with the spell, amplified by the cavern, shook Crea to her core causing a momentary numbness to her body that made her fall several feet before she could regain control. But thanks to the brief light from the spell Crea was able to catch a glimpse of what appeared to be a miniature, dark scaled dragon behind Falnor but she couldn’t be sure. It looked deformed and unproportioned, yet it also seemed faded and obscure like it was there but at the same time it wasn’t. What disturbed her the most was how it smiled innocently at her. She didn’t have time to think about it any further as Falnor was quickly recovering from that surprise attack. She flew down for a quick respite beside Inquest, her wings dragging on the floor completely exhausted. </p><p>“What now?” she asked with laboured breath. “I can’t keep flying around him forever.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you lasted so long,” he joked, “your flying skills haven’t dulled a bit.”</p><p>“Yeah well, luckily he didn’t breathe fire. Doubt I would have lasted so long.”</p><p>“That is lucky,” Inquest mumbled curiously. “Ah, of course!” Before Crea could question the pony, Inquest quickly galloped back towards the tunnel and stood in front of Falnor’s tail. </p><p>“What’s wrong Falnor!?” Inquest shouted in a smug tone. “Having a hard time with just one pony and gryphon!? You dragons are nothing more than oversized lizards that take up way too much space!” The dragon turned his attention to Inquest with a large scowl. </p><p><b>“Now that’s just uncalled for! There’s no need for name calling!”</b></p><p>“What’s so great about dragons anyway!? I bet my heating gem does a lot better job than your so called fire breath! Probably can’t even light a candle!!”</p><p>“What are you doing!?” Crea shouted in disbelief as she moved to stand between him and the dragon, hoping to draw its attention away again. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“ENOUGH!!!”</span> Falnor reared back it’s head as he sucked in a great amount of air into his lungs. There was a sudden ominous glow emanating from the dragon’s chest and Inquest could already feel the intense heat radiating from it. Just as Inquest had predicted, Falnor also removed his tail away from the line of fire. Dragon’s did have an affinity with fire and their scales offered some protection from it, but not enough to protect them from the heat of their own breath. </p><p>“You’re not suggesting we try out running his breath are you!?” shouted the gryphon. “We’ll never make it!”</p><p>“Of course not! Just stay close to me!” Inquest’s horn glowed brightly once more and a white membrane like bubble started to envelop both Crea and himself. </p><p>Both pony and gryphon were then lifted up a few feet off the ground as the spell finally took hold. Crea had seen Inquest’s bubble shield spell before, but in most cases they had a white translucent layer that allowed one to see through. This time however Inquest kept adding layer after layer of protection until Crea could see nothing but white all around her. She felt the temperature of the air inside dropping to near freezing, likely to prevent the heat from cooking them alive. </p><p>Crea readied herself for the inevitable. A second later the dragon let out a roar that rivaled the thunder from Inquest’s lighting. Her whole body jerked sideways as the shield around her shook violently about, the once cold air inside quickly became unbearably hot. What terrified her the most was the sound of fire constantly roaring outside of the bubble. Reminding her that just between her and the bubble was a raging inferno that could turn them to ash in mere seconds. There was a brief moment of silence before Crea felt the shield break through what sounded like trees that splintering apart around them. Then they collided with something hard that nearly broke the shield apart as a huge crack suddenly appeared between her and Inquest. The kept tumbling a bit further before finally everything went still and silent. </p><p>Crea heard Inquest let out a heavy sigh before the spell around them evaporated into nothing. With a groan Inquest started to tilt sideways but luckily Crea was already by his side and caught him just as he succumbed to exhaustion. Only then did Crea take notice of the scene around her, it was like a giant cannon had been fired against the forest. The tunnel acted as a barrel with them as the ammunition. Everything in their path had been completely obliterated, trees thicker than her were blown apart like toothpicks and the few that remained standing had their branches ripped off by the sheer force of the blast. What was most impressive were the various broken pieces of rocks strewn about the place. Looking at what remained it was likely that they had collided with a nearby boulder large enough to have easily been considered a small hill. Crea slowly turned her attention back down on the unconscious pony with a look of wide-eyed wonder. This was not the first time she had been struck speechless by Inquest’s raw power and concentration. </p><p>She finally snapped out of it and realized that they were still in danger. They might have escaped the dragon but they were still in the Everfree. What’s more it was now night time with the moon still early in its ascent, the more dangerous predators mostly came out at night at night. Mostly. Hopefully the majority of the forest’s inhabitants had fled from the disturbance which would offer them some time to rest, but none of that mattered right now. She had to find a place for them to rest and hide from the dragon lest he decides to give chase. Crea quickly took out several dark green leaves from one of her pockets and crushed them before applying the paste over her wound. She picked up Inquest’s unconscious body and slung him over her shoulders and ran towards the forest into the night. </p><hr/><p><b>“That didn’t turn out as I expected,”</b> grumbled Falnor. <b>“Though I have to admit, that was an impressive feat for a pony.”</b></p><p>“They’re still alive?” asked the voice in a eerily sweet tone. </p><p><b>“I’m afraid so my dear, sorry I couldn’t kill them like you wanted.”</b> Falnor gave his daughter a gentle nudge with his snout. </p><p>“Where are they now?”</p><p><b>“Most likely somewhere in the forest still, though I would wager they’re headed towards Ponyville.”</b> Falnor noticed her confused expression. <b>“It’s a town nearby, just outside the forest. The same place where the Kindling is I believe.”</b> </p><p>“Kindling?”</p><p><b>“It’s nothing dear, some odd creature that popped out of nowhere some time ago. You remember right?”</b></p><p>“Ah, that thing. Yes I remember.” Giving his wound a slight rub, Falnor made his way to pick up his makeshift broom and began cleaning the cavern once again. Just they way his daughter asked him to.</p><p>“Daddy, I want you to destroy that town,”</p><p><b>“That might not be a good idea, we did promise not to harm any of the inhabitants. One or two is easy enough to hide but an entire town will attract far too much attention.”</b></p><p>“But daddy, those two will tell on you.”</p><p><b>“I suppose they would,”</b> he said with a sigh, <b>“though there’s nothing we can do about it now. We’ll just apologize to the Sisters and say it was all just one big misunderstanding. I’m sure they’ll understand.”</b></p><p>“No daddy, they won’t. They’ll be very angry.” </p><p>Falnor froze as an image suddenly popped into his mind, he saw both alicorns screaming at him. </p><p>“They’re going to send us away.” </p><p>In his mind Falnor saw the Sisters destroy his cave. </p><p>“And they’ll send soldiers to take me away.” </p><p>Hundreds of ponies clad in golden armor charged at him with as they carried his daughter away. </p><p>“They're going to hurt me daddy.” </p><p>Suddenly every soldier turned their weapons and spells to his daughter.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“NOOOOO!! THEY WILL ALL DIE!!!”</span> Falnor roared with enough force to rattle the entire cavern causing bits and pieces of stalactite to rain down on him. He quickly made his way through the tunnel and immediately took to the skies. With grim determination he veered toward the direction of the small town not too far off in the distance.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 31 - Leave them to die<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock</p><hr/><p>&quot;I'm sorry but, could you please repeat that sir....?&quot; The night guard shot another glance to the door behind him to make sure no pony was prying into the conversation. It was mostly to set his mind at ease, as two guards stood outside the town hall doors and he was confident they'd keep their conversation private.</p><p>&quot;Lieutenant Steadfast,&quot; replied the pegasus night guard, &quot;and it is as I said Miss Mayor, we believe there may be something in the Everfree that may pose a danger to the town. My soldiers and I were deployed under royal orders to stand guard in Ponyville and if need be defend it until such time as that threat is neutralized.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; interrupted Twilight, &quot;it's true that the Everfree is dangerous, but it's very rare for any creature to wander into town. Unless of course <i>somepony</i> purposely provoked them.&quot; Twilight's mind wandered to the Ursa incident and the two colts that foolishly brought it to town. &quot;What makes this situation any different?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I assure you Miss Sparkle-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please, just Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Miss Twilight, I was directed to divulge all information regarding this mission to both Miss Mayor and yourself. For obvious reasons. It must be made clear however, that nothing leaves this room lest it incite panic amongst the townsfolk.&quot; The lieutenant paused for a moment to let his words sink in. &quot;Regarding the situation, I was ordered to protect the town from any danger until given new directives by The Professor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>The</i> Professor?&quot; asked Twilight surprised. &quot;You mean Professor Inquest!?&quot; Twilight couldn't help but smile at the mention of The Professor. He was the first unicorn in over one hundred and fifty years to take on the mantle of Professor, and the foremost expert on magic in Equestria. Her admiration for the old pony was second only to Princess Celestia herself. She had also read about many of his past exploits, and knew first hand exactly how talented, skilled, and powerful he was from the rare occasions when he had been willing to teach her something in person. His involvement however indicated that the situation was beyond ‘serious’, likely even dangerous. &quot;Why is The Professor involved?&quot;</p><p>&quot;As I mentioned earlier, our mission is to protect the town until the danger is neutralized. The Professor will be the one to determine that, his mission is to hopefully resolve the problem before it poses a threat.&quot; Steadfast looked out the window to see the sun start to set in the distance. &quot;I’m sorry, but that is all the information I was given. In fact much of this mission is unknown. Our orders were simply to keep the residents of this town safe from any and all danger.&quot; He turned his attention to the mayor. &quot;I believe there are living quarters reserved for royal guards in town, is that correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah yes, there are. They’re not far from here, though the building itself hasn't been used in a long time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, as long as its structurally sound then we'll be fine.&quot; He took a step sideways and gestured with a wing for the mayor to lead the way. &quot;Miss Twilight,&quot; he turned and gave a salute to Twilight,  before following the mayor out the door leaving her alone in the office.</p><p><i>'Might as well go home and make sure Spike helped Shine Bright properly settle in,'</i> thought Twilight as she too made for the door.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>======[Several hours later.....]======</p></div><p>&quot;Sorry again about dropping by unannounced,&quot; I hollered towards the kitchen. </p><p>&quot;Oh it's no bother,&quot; Fluttershy replied in her ever so gentle voice</p><p>&quot;Are you sure you don't need any help back there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You could help me with the vegetables. Uhm....that is, if you want to.&quot; I chuckled before leaning forward on the table to look staring intently at Sweetie Belle's eyes.</p><p>&quot;Don't. Break. Anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; She glared at me angrily with a such an adorable pout that would have made weaker men d'aww. With a light laugh I headed towards the kitchen to see Fluttershy mixing what looked liked salad. In one wing she held a large wooden bowl while the other held a long spoon, unlike unicorns it seemed pegasi and earth ponies had to go about their daily lives the normal way. At least as far as &quot;normal&quot; goes in this world.</p><p>&quot;So where do you-&quot; Before I could get another word out, I spotted a large carrot hurtling right at me from somewhere above. It bounced off my forehead with a loud thud before I manage to catch it in my hand.</p><p>&quot;Angel! That was very rude!&quot; Standing on top of a cabinet was a familiar white bunny bearing his teeth down at me. He was wearing a red bandanna around his head and two black strips of what looked like war paint under his eyes. &quot;I'm so sorry Rodney!&quot; the pegasus apologized desperately. &quot;I'm not sure what's gotten into him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright, he'll warm up to me eventually.&quot; I looked back up just in time to see him lob another carrot which I effortlessly stopped in mid air with a levitation spell. That didn't seem to deter him however, in fact he seemed more motivated and started throwing carrot after carrot with abandon. After about ten seconds of this he finally ran out of ammo and out of breath, at which point I had about a dozen carrots floating in front of me pointing right at my face. </p><p>&quot;Uhm...Rodney, could you....&quot; Turning to her I noticed her staring at the burning carrots fearfully taking a step back. Realizing that my display of magic was frightening the timid pony, I quickly cut them off causing all the carrots to hit the floor with drum like thuds.</p><p>&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; I apologized before picking up the carrots. &quot;I didn’t mean to frighten you Fluttershy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's ok, I mean, I know you wouldn't do anything to hurt me. It's just...well I...&quot; I smiled as she fumbled trying to find a way to express her fear without accidentally insulting me.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry I get what you mean,&quot; I assured her as I picked up the last carrot. &quot;I know that there are still some ponies in town that are intimidated by me, especially since I’ve got these on all the time.&quot; I twisted my wrist around making the chains jingle loudly. Hearing that last bit however seemed to trigger a concerned reaction.</p><p>&quot;Oh....ok. They're not, that is.... You're not-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, nobody’s giving me any trouble. So far they seem to just stay away from me. Which might be for the best. Eventually they'll get used to seeing stuff burn blue around me,&quot; I joked to ease her worries. &quot;Really I'm fine Flutters.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok then, if you say so.&quot; She turned her attention back to preparing dinner as I piled the carrots up on a nearby table.</p><p>&quot;So what do you need help with?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, umm, could you cut those up please?&quot; Using her wing she pointed towards some vegetables gathered next to what looked like a cutting board with an attached cutter to the side. Similar to the ones you often find in offices for cutting paper. &quot;That is, if you don't mind of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wouldn't have asked if I did.&quot; I carefully made my way past her to stand in front of the cutting board. </p><p>&quot;I didn't know you could use magic like that,&quot; Fluttershy started. Likely hoping to get a conversation going. &quot;I mean I know you can, but I didn't realize you were so good with it. The way you were able to catch all those carrots was really impressive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I'm not a unicorn so can't say for sure. But I hear it's very tricky to hold multiple spells together like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh....&quot; Now that I think about it, that was quite impressive. I could have easily created a single levitation field in front of me and it would have done the job just fine, albeit less efficiently, yet I caught every projectile individually with such speed and ease that I didn’t even realize it.</p><p><i>'I suppose that means I’m getting used to magic?'</i> Granted, a levitation spell wasn't something considered difficult or complex, hell it was the first thing Twilight taught be back in the castle. But even so, back then I had to focus and give some effort of concentration for it to work on a single target. But now....</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Isn't that normal? Do something enough times and eventually it becomes easier.'</span></p><p><i>'Probably.'</i> Of course I'm not anywhere near the level of expertise and control that Twilight has, or with Rarity's uncanny precision. Still, I felt a satisfying feeling of accomplishment about it. </p><p>&quot;Rodney?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm?&quot; Fluttershy was glancing at the uncut vegetables. &quot;Oh sorry, kinda lost myself there.&quot; I grabbed a cucumber and started dicing it. &quot;I hope you don't mind me bringing Sweetie Belle along. I was planning on taking her back before I visited but I didn't want to go back to town just yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;On no it's ok, she's such a sweet little filly. But why didn’t you go back? If you don't mind me asking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You didn't see the balloon-ship thing?&quot; Her ears jerked upright.</p><p>&quot;Oh you mean the air-boat? I forgot about that, I was too busy taking care of Mr. Quackalot all day. Do you know anything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope, I was at Sweet Apple Acres when they arrived. I did see what looked like guards from the castle get dropped off. Sweets and I took a roundabout route to get here.&quot; I turned to look at Fluttershy with a raised brow. &quot;Uh....Mr. Quackalot?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One of the ducks living here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......You named him Quackalot?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Isn't it adorable? He has such a wonderful voice.&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a class="embed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DyauAgit0E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DyauAgit0E</a></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>(AN:Because why not?)</p></div><p>&quot;There's also Elizabeak, Humfurry, Hummingway, Mr.Beaverton Beaverteeth, Mrs.Bearveton-&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.pond5.com/sound-effect/8701002/animal-roar.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">&quot;WRAAAAAAAAAGH!!!&quot;</span></a></p><br/><p>The thundering noise sounded like a jumbo jet was flying inches above me, forcing me to shield my ears with both hands. The entire room vibrated about violently causing dishes, pots, and other kitchenware to rain down on us. As abruptly as it began the deafening noise disappeared leaving my ears ringing along with some disorientation. </p><p>&quot;Dafuq was that!?&quot; I looked around at the myriad of broken glass and ruined food only to see myself alone in the kitchen. &quot;Fluttershy?&quot; </p><p>I felt something land on my head before Angel dropped to the floor and bounced away towards what looked like an large overturned wash basin. I didn't know how it was possible but Angel somehow managed to kick the basin with enough force to flip it over revealing a shivering yellow bundle of feathers and fur. Both her front hooves and wings were covering her face and she was curled so perfectly round that it made her look like a giant hamster.</p><p>&quot;Fluttershy?&quot; I called again in a more soothing tone. &quot;You ok there?&quot; I tried reaching out to calm her down but my touch only made her whimper and curl up even tighter. Angel jumped in front of me with both paws stretched out to the side and shook his head. I figured he was trying to tell me to just leave her alone and give her some time to recuperate from the shock.</p><p>&quot;Oh crap, Sweetie Belle!&quot; I rushed towards the living room breaking fallen glass and plates with every step. &quot;Sweets you ok!?&quot; I shouted out before turning the corner only to see her seat empty. Everything in the room was in a similar state of disarray as the kitchen, with books and most of the smaller objects littering the floor. </p><p>&quot;Sweetie Belle!&quot; I rapidly started searching the corners, cabinets and every other place she could potentially fit into, but to no avail. I was about to head to the second floor only to stop mid stride when I noticed the front door ajar. Panic started to set in as I ran out and skidded to a halt just outside the front door with my head swinging from side to side trying to find any sign of the little pony. </p><p>Something caught my attention in the night sky, at first I thought it was just some kind of large bird of sorts. But after a closer look I realized that I had gauged the distance incorrectly, slowly I realized exactly how massive it really was. Wide eyed and a slack-jawed I stared at the impossible creature as it circled above Ponyville like a vulture.</p><p>&quot;Oh Jesus.....&quot; It didn't matter that I was stuck in a world of talking ponies, that I actually live and work for one, or that I was throwing fireballs and weaving magic spells using computer language. In spite of all the things I’d seen, done, learned, or heard about I still couldn't believe what I was seeing.</p><p>A dragon.</p><p>A full grown, six-appendaged, straight out of a fairy tale, green dragon was flying high in the sky. It was difficult to judge the exact size in the night but from what I could see it was definitely gigantic. It could have easily towered above a six story building and had a mass at least equal to a large fishing boat, possibly even a whaler ship. With its wings spread out wide, the dragon could span out and cover four or five basketball fields, it was the first flying creature that looked like it could actually fly without the aid of magic.</p><p>My mind was completely baffled as I stared at the scene, lost to the moment, trying to process the ridiculous sight. Should I be ecstatic that one of the greatest and oldest element of fantasy was alive and real right before my eyes? Or crap my pants knowing there was a larger than life, flying, fire-breathing lizard that could swallow me whole like a bite-sized snack? I just stared in disbelief until I heard the faint cries and shouts of panic from off in the distance. Prying my gaze away from the dragon I was able to make out the town’s residents galloping through the streets in a panic, knocking off stalls and even lamp posts. Likely they would try to get back home or to some kind of shelter, though I wasn’t not sure how much that would help when the dragon could easily destroy any of the buildings in town using its weight alone. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Are we not looking for someone?'</span></p><p>&quot;Ah dammit!&quot; Realizing the severity of the situation I resumed my search for Sweetie Belle, but even as I circled around the cottage I couldn't see any sign of her whereabouts. My heart was thumping like a jackhammer and I could feel the blood pulsing in my ears. I returned to the front door to look back inside, hoping that somehow she was still inside the cottage somewhere and that I had simply missed her. It was then that a troubling thought came to mind.</p><p><i>'What if she was headed back to town?'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Why would she?’</span> </p><p><i>'Rarity.'</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Are you sure? She's probably still hiding somewhere inside.'</span></p><p>&quot;And what if she left!? There's time to catch up to her if I leave now!&quot; I shouted both mentally and physically. I took a step inside the cottage and yelled as loud as I could, &quot;Sweetie Belle! Are you in here!?&quot; I waited and hoped to hear her reply but there was only silence. “Dammit! Fluttershy, stay here in case Sweetie Belle comes back!” </p><p>A moment later I could hear her soft frightened voice from inside the kitchen, “O-ok.” With that I turned and started running down the dirt road leading to town.</p><p>Soon as I crossed the small bridge I picked up a small rock nearby to act as a lantern before casting the maglev spell on my feet. With some quick thinking I launched myself with the propulsion spell and continued casting it in between strides giving me small bursts of acceleration. I ignored the cold bite of the night wind blowing on my face as I blazed down the road, leaving small licks of azure flame behind me.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>======[Ponyville....]======</p></div><p>&quot;What was that?&quot; asked Shine Bright as she looked outside the window. She was in the middle of helping Spike prepare dinner when they heard the loud rumbling in the distance.</p><p>&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; answered Twilight as she too looked out from a different window while Spike stood on her back wearing an apron with pink frills and a large red heart in the middle. &quot;It almost sounds like-Oh those two had better not wake another Ursa!&quot; She quickly trotted towards the front door before levitating the young dragon off of her. &quot;Spike stay here with Shine Bright while I check things out ok.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can't I go with?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now Spike it's rude to leave a guest alone, I need you to keep her company.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's quite alright Miss Sparkle, he doesn't have to do that,&quot; spoke the light-brown mare making Spike smile.</p><p>&quot;See? She's ok with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Twilight conceded with a sigh, allowing Spike to jump on her back again. &quot;And please, it's just Twilight,&quot; she spoke to Shine, &quot;we're not in the castle anymore and you're not my maid.&quot; Twilight turned and galloped out the front door leaving Shine Bright alone in the library.</p><p>As Twilight made her way through town she noted numerous ponies mill about outside in small groups, with a few staring at the sky trying to find the source of the disturbance earlier. Usually in situations like these all Twilight had to do was follow the crowd, but seeing as most of the ponies were just as confused as she was that wasn't an option.</p><p>&quot;Everypony run for your lives!!&quot; screamed a stallion. </p><p>Then again sometimes you just had to be patient.</p><p>&quot;What was that about?&quot; asked Spike confused.</p><p>&quot;Hey wait a minute!&quot; Twilight was about to question the pony but he ignored her completely and kept galloping on with a frightened look in his eyes.They heard another roar go off in the distance a moment later, and then out of nowhere came a surge of ponies galloping towards her all screaming and shouting.</p><p>&quot;Everypony run!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The horror! The horror!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're all gonna die!!!&quot; Panic spread like wildfire and in seconds every pony was galloping in every direction forcing Twilight to duck and dodge to avoid getting trampled. Many had taken shelter inside their homes while others simply went for anything close by that would offer protection. One stallion even dove right into a nearby well.</p><p>&quot;Uhh...Twilight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not now Spike I need to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twilight look!!&quot; Without warning Spike wrapped his claws around her neck and pulled her head back, forcing her to look upward.</p><p>&quot;Spike! Stop it I can-oh Celestia...&quot; Twilight's mane fell flat on her head while her eyes widened with a look of disbelief and confusion. &quot;Why is a dra-&quot;</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">&quot;EVERYPONY REMAIN CALM!!&quot;</span> Twilight's ears bent over her head reflexively trying to block out the loud booming voice. It reminded her of Princess Luna's <i>Royal Canterlot  Voice</i>. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">&quot;HEAD TO YOUR HOMES AND REMAIN INDOORS!!&quot;</span> Twilight looked upwards towards the source of the voice and saw a pegasus night guard standing on the roof of a nearby house. Flanking him was a lithe day guard - likely a mare - whose horn was glowing brightly. </p><p>&quot;Spike go back to the library.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!? No way Twilight I'm staying with you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No you're not! It's too dangerous!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what about you?! I'm not going any-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go back now!!&quot; she suddenly yelled silencing the baby dragon. She turned to look at him before speaking in a soft and pleading voice that was heard above the screams and chaos from all around, &quot;Please.&quot;</p><p>Spike looked at her eyes with a blank stare for a moment before hopping to the ground and started running of towards the library without uttering a word. Twilight stared at her adopted sibling with a worried expression before turning her attention back to the guard on the rooftop. Her horn glowed as she gathered the needed amount of magic before disappearing in a flash of purple light only to reappear a second later on the rooftop.</p><p>&quot;Lieutenant Steadfast?&quot; she called noticing the slight different design of his armor, indicating rank.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">&quot;MISS TWI-,&quot;</span> he cut off as Twilight's mane blew back from his magnified voice leaving her ears ringing. He gave the unicorn guard a look before the glow of her horn dimmed and disappeared. &quot;Sorry about that. Now what are you doing here? Please return to your home and remain inside until we get the situation under control!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is this what you we meant earlier?! Did you know a dragon was coming!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We do not know if this is an attack! No dragon has ever broken the treaty!&quot; he shouted running out of patience. &quot;Now if you could please-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lieutenant!!&quot; shouted the mare guard alarmingly as she stared upwards with wide eyed fear. Both Twilight and the lieutenant quickly followed her gaze before taking on a similar expression. High above the green dragon was now hovering in place and glowering down, there was a yellowish glow emanating from the its belly while small licks of flame erupted from its mouth.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>======[A few minutes before....]======</p></div><p>&quot;Let me go!&quot; screamed the filly as she bucked and flailed her hooves about while floating a foot off the ground next to me. </p><p>&quot;Like hell I will!&quot; I shouted back angrily. &quot;Dammit what were you thinking running off like that!?&quot; Sweetie Belle kept kicking and screaming frantically trying to break away from my levitation spell, forcing me to exert more magic for a stronger hold.</p><p>Despite her small body and short legs Sweetie Belle managed to cover a surprisingly long distance before I finally caught up. We were just outside the town's perimeter, the outermost building was only a minute or two away and I could still hear the screams and shouts from the town louder than ever. The dragon was also much closer now, but thankfully it hadn’t done anything so far. Unfortunately my estimate of the creature's size wasn't too far off, with its large wings it would only take one or two flaps and a few seconds for it to fly over us. </p><p>&quot;Look, I know you're worried about your sister but running off like that was just plain stupid! What would Rarity say if she found out!?&quot; Sweetie Belle started to calm a bit at that. &quot;The best thing you can do for her is to stay safe. You saw the ship in town right? All those guards? I'm sure they'll take care of things.&quot;</p><p>That was a lie of course, or rather I wasn’t entirely confident they had the necessary numbers to do anything against it. I would imagine it would take a small army to take down a dragon and that’s just taking its size into consideration. Whether or not it could breathe fire has yet to be determined. As much as I would like to help, there was simply nothing I could do in this situation. I wasn’t a fighter of any sort and the only offensive spell I had wasn’t even a real spell. Fireballs were the only thing I could make at the moment, the idea of using fire to fight a dragon was just plain stupid. </p><p>But all that didn't really matter, or at least it was not what concerned me the most. Truth be told I was just freaked out, plain and simple. If I weren't so concerned for the filly I would be busy trying to put as much distance between myself and the dragon as possible.  The only rational thing I could think to do was to stay out of harms way and keep those around me safe, which meant getting Sweetie Belle back to Fluttershy's place.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'For once I actually don't have to talk you out of something stupid. We might die of old age after all.'</span></p><p>“C’mon, let’s get out of here.” I was just about to carry the filly and take her back to the cottage when the screams from town suddenly intensified.</p><p>I immediately looked back up just in time to see the dragon suddenly extending it’s head forward with its jaws wide open, revealing multiple rows of serrated white teeth before fire started flooding out. As if a gate to hell itself the inferno kept spewing forth from its maw like a waterfall bellowing down towards the center of town. My first urge was to turn and run as fast as I could before the fire could reach me, and I probably would have if Sweetie Belle hadn’t suddenly latched herself around my leg. Before I knew it I was kneeling on the ground, eyes shut tight while I held Sweetie Belle next to my belly and used my own body to shield her from the fire.</p><hr/><p>“I guess you really are related to the Captain,” spoke the lieutenant in a hushed yet impressed tone as he gazed up at the translucent purple dome. What was most impressive was the speed in which the purple mare was able to cast such a grand spell in a fraction of second. It spread far and wide covering the entire town from edge to edge like a giant bubble, much like the one Captain Shining Armor made during the changeling crisis. The fire continued to rage outside covering the dome and bathing the town in fiery orange light, the sky looked like it was completely lit afire.</p><p>“Unfortunately it’s not the same spell ,” replied Twilight with a strain in her voice, “it’s not as strong and I’m....not sure how long I can hold it.” Minute sparks of magic leaked from the tip of her horn while it shined brightly in different shades of purple. A small trail of purple light - like a thread- rose from the tip of her horn all the way up till it reached the dome, constantly feeding it with magic in order to keep it from collapsing.</p><p>“Give us as much time as you can!” shouted the lieutenant as he turned to the other guard. “Sergeant! Get back to the squad and order all the unicorns to spread themselves evenly around the town! Take charge and oversee to the town’s defense. Earth ponies are on civilian duty! Quell the panic, gather the civilians, and get them ready in case we need to evacuate! Tell every pegasi to rendezvous with me here!” The unicorn guard gave a salute before disappearing in a flash of golden light. Steadfast took a deep breath to collect himself as he looked to fiery sky which had thankfully started to ebb away revealing the night.</p><hr/><p>“Ah dammit!!” I shouted angrily while pacing back and forth in front of the purple wall. If the color was anything to go by I was willing to bet every bit I own that Twilight was behind all this, she was pretty much the only unicorn in town that had enough magic and skill to create something like that. </p><p>It’s not that I was ungrateful or anything, unfortunately the same spell that had saved the town  was now preventing me from leaving. But it wasn’t like that was an option anymore, the fire had spread over the dome and scorched the surrounding area. Many trees were still burning and patches of the earth were black. Plus I could ‘feel’ that the dome was made entirely out of magic and it was the only thing protecting the town from that dragon. If I so much as touched it....</p><p>“Fuck!!” I turned to Sweetie Belle. “You didn’t hear that.” She was looking at me with fresh tears in her eyes from crying uncontrollably out of fear while hugging my leg earlier, it took some soothing to calm her down and get her to let go.</p><p>“So...what do we do now?” she asked nervously. </p><p>I looked back up at the dragon that luckily had decided to continue flying in circles after its initial attack failed. I had half-expected it to drop down on the dome and start bashing at it. I could roughly guess how powerful Twilight was after powering up that arcane gem, but even she would be hard pressed maintaining something like that against a raging dragon. Even if I had three times the amount of magic that I could hold, there was no way that I could make anything close to what Twilight had created. Maybe a shield around myself, but the entire town?</p><p>“We can’t stay out in the open like this, is there an emergency shelter or bunker in town?” I asked with high hopes.</p><p>“Applejack’s the only one I know that has a cellar, but it’s at her farm.”</p><p><i>‘Bronze’s bar is close by, maybe he has basement or a storage room to keep his supply somewhere.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh sure! Let’s go hide in a room filled with flammable liquid while the town’s under attack by a FIRE BREATHING DRAGON!!’</span></p><p>“Yeah I guess that was a stupid idea...,” I mumbled irritably.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” I let out a sigh. “Our best chance is to head for the safest part of town.” Looking back at the ceiling of the dome I noticed what looked like a small trail of light rising to the dome from somewhere in the distance. It would stand to reason that would be where Twilight was, and what else could be safer than being next to a unicorn as powerful as her. Unfortunately I’d used up most of my magic trying to catch up with Sweetie Belle and I couldn’t waste anymore in case of an emergency. I turned my back to Sweetie Belle and crouched as low as I could.</p><p>“Grab on Sweets. We’re gonna go find Twilight, I’m sure she’ll know what to do. Climb up and wrap your hoof around my neck.” I felt her hoof on my back and in a few moments she was riding piggyback on me. I held the chains in my hands giving her something to sit on for support before running down the street straight towards where I assumed Twilight would be.</p><hr/><p>“So what’s the plan?” asked Twilight as she let out a long sigh of relief. The strain of the spell had dramatically diminished now that the shield was no longer under assault. The intensity of light shining from her horn had diminished along with the trail of light, unlike before she merely had to feed a minimal amount of magic in order to keep the spell alive. This would give her some time to recuperate and collect herself, at least until the next attack.</p><p>“Should we evacuate everypony?” she asked again. “We could use the train to take everypo-” suddenly one of Twilight’s hind legs gave out causing her to suddenly lurch and tilt dangerously to the side. Thankfully Steadfast was quick enough to intercept and use his own body to hold Twilight from tumbling over.</p><p>“First we need you back on the ground ma’am.” Twilight felt  his hooves hook under her and lift her off the roof before being carefully lowered to the street below.</p><p>“Sorry, that took more out of me than I expected.” She took a deep breath with a worried look. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep the shield alive for long.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, the sergeant has that covered.” Before Twilight could question what he meant she noticed a golden trail of light rising from the distance much like her’s.</p><p>She caught sight of another light rising alongside far off to her left and another somewhere near the edge of the town to the right, although these ones were dark blue. There were more behind her and from all around town, most of them golden, but there were a few dark blues here and there. They froze at different elevations before a membrane like shell started to spread from their tips across the sky,mimicking Twilight’s spell. The golden and dark blue color clashed and mixed creating a oil-like appearance, slowly thickening like a gelatinous substance. </p><p>“Compliments of the Professor,” explained Steadfast with mild admiration. “The Captain’s shield was remarkably effective, unfortunately only a few very rare unicorns have the required magic to cast and maintain a spell of such magnitude. The Professor created a variation that would work from multiple casters, each pooling their magic together. As such it’s stronger compared to the single caster version, even stronger than the Captain’s.” He turned to look at the purple unicorn still gazing upwards with wide eyed amazement. “You can turn yours off now.”</p><p>“Oh, right.” As Twilight cut of her flow of magic the glow around her horn disappeared, the light from the tip suddenly cut off before the purple dome started to evaporate seconds later. “But what about the dragon? We can’t just wait it out.” Even with the combined magical might of trained unicorn guards, Twilight knew it would only buy them time.</p><p>“That’s exactly what need to do.” Twilight gave a confused look. “This town is located right under Canterlot’s shadow. Did you think an attack, by a dragon no less, this close to Equestria’s seat of power wouldn’t go unnoticed?” Twilight’s eyes widened slightly in realization. “Unfortunately it’ll take time for reinforcement to mobilize and longer to arrive. Which is why I’ll lead a team to distract the dragon and buy us as much time as possible.”</p><p>“What!? That’s crazy!! There has to be-”</p><p>“I’m afraid we don’t have time to strategize ma’am,” he interrupted, “we have to act now before it attacks again.” As Twilight was about to argue there came the sound of wingbeats from above as a dozen or so royal pegasi guards landed in formation nearby. “Your quick thinking has saved many lives today including those of my squad, and for that I am truly grateful. Now it’s our turn to do our duty, please leave it to us Miss Sparkle.” With that he turned, spread his wings and with a leap flew off to the sky followed by all the pegasi guards.</p><p>“Lieutenant!” Twilight shouted as she watched them shrink into the distance. She stood there frozen in place not quite sure what to do.</p><p>“Twilight!!”</p><hr/><p>“Twilight!!” My call caught the mare’s attention as I continued to to run towards her. I stopped just in front of her panting for breath with Sweetie Belle still on my back, likely trying not to hurl her stomach contents all over me. </p><p>“Rodney? Sweetie Belle?” she asked glancing from me to the filly with a confused look. Her expression suddenly shifted to anger and disbelief. “What were you thinking bringing her here!? Where’s Rarity?”</p><p>“Back from Fluttershy’s....your spell trapped me.....don’t know where Rarity is,” I replied between heavy breathing.</p><p>“Why didn’t you take her home!?”</p><p>“I didn’t know what to do!!” I shouted out of frustration. “I thought we’d be safe with you!” The whole ridiculous situation and everything that had happened tonight was just too much for me to keep under control. “What the hell is going on!? Why is a dragon trying to kill us?!”</p><p>“Rodney,” whimpered Sweetie Belle. Her hooves tightened around my neck nervously and I realized that my shouting was unnerving her. </p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to-”</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">&quot;GRAAAAAAAH!!!&quot;</span></p><p>I fell to my knees and threw my hands to cover my ears with gritted teeth trying my best to block out the roar. I felt Sweetie Belle’s hooves release my neck as she tried to cover her ears as well, causing her to slip sideways and fall to the ground. As soon as the noise ebbed away I got back to my feet and looked to the sky. </p><p>“What are they doing?” I asked as the group of guards that had taken off before flew right through the dome and were on their way to engage the dragon.</p><p>I held my breath as they closed the distance before dispersing just as the dragon swung it’s spiked tail at them. Whether it was luck, skill, or both; it didn't seem like any of the guards were hit, otherwise I would’ve seen someone hurtling towards the ground. Armored or not, getting hit by something of that magnitude and momentum - even without the spikes - could easily kill someone from the impact alone. </p><p>“They’re buying us time until reinforcements arrive from Canterlot.” They continued to fly around the beast like flies, which pretty much surmised their difference in size, constantly poking and prodding with blasts of magic. </p><p>“They can use magic like that?”</p><p>“Gems socketed into their armor infused with magic and spells,” she explained.</p><p>“Doesn’t look like they’re doing much. I think they’re just pissing it off.” The dragon’s fervor and frustration was evidently increasing over time as the attacks came faster and more vicious. It was actually quite impressive how it managed to constantly be on the offensive yet remain airborne. Despite its effort the pegasi proved too agile and swift with their significantly smaller size, constantly and nimbly dodging every attack flawlessly. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">“ENOUGH!!”</span> roared the dragon causing the windows around to shake. </p><p>“It can talk!?” I had assumed the dragon to be some kind of wild animal incapable of speech. Though Spike did claim he was a dragon, I never considered the two to be of the same species. Who would have believed that someone like Spike, little tiny Spike, would eventually grow up to a behemoth like that. Still, I didn’t really care about that at the moment and Twilight didn’t bother answering. </p><p>Even from this distance and the murkiness of the dome I was able to see the dragon’s chest suddenly glow while fire started escaping from its jaw. It was plain to see what was coming and I had expected the pegasi to disperse away from the dragon in a mad rush to escape the inferno. Instead they regrouped like flocks of birds and started flying high into the sky gaining altitude with every second. I then realized that even under threat of being burned alive they still choose to place the safety of the town above their own, because now the dragon had to aim upwards away from the town in order to hit any of them.</p><p>But what came out of the dragon’s open jaw, no one expected. </p><p>It was fire for certain and for a second I thought those pegasi would get away scot free now that they were so far away. But as the fire continue to pour out I noticed it didn’t spread like it did before, in fact the way it moved and morphed about made it look alive. It shrunk and focused before breaking apart to two, then four, and continuing to multiply until it looked a meteor shower in the sky. At first it seemed like these things were simply flying straight but as soon as the pegasi started to break away the ‘fireballs’ followed suit.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/0e3d76aec590ac14e3b6e798cdb8a13c60cce955?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc04.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2013%2F053%2F5%2F8%2Ffire_shotgun_by_jtjandra-d5vwaoj.jpg" /></p></div><p>At this point the pegasi were too far off from me to see, I could just barely make out their shadows but from the way these fireballs erratically flew about in the sky it was clear how desperate the ponies were trying to escape. It was like the stars were dancing above tracing light behind them as if someone was trying to paint the night sky. A few fired off a spell or two at the oncoming missiles causing them to explode like fireworks. But try as they might they were considerably outnumbered and soon enough explosions started to decorate the sky, a few were unfortunate enough to be struck multiple times. Every hit lit up the sky giving a glimpse of the fierce chase and revealing more freefalling ponies. Some tried to give chase in order save their comrades but they were quickly struck down from behind.</p><p>Before long I was able to make out the shadowy figures of ponies falling from the sky in the distance all trailing smoke. If the fireballs hadn’t killed them the fall surely would. Unfortunately their attempt to distract the dragon away from the town had had backfired, now they were too far away for anyone to help in time. </p><p>“Rodney?” Looking down I saw Sweetie Belle staring at me, expecting that I could somehow save them. </p><p>“I-I don’t.....They’re too far away I can’t...” I turned and looked at Twilight with the same hopeful look. Yet before she could respond there came a sudden booming explosion that echoed across the sky resonating above all the clamour. </p><p>At first I thought the sound of the explosion came from the dragon, but then I realize it had originated from somewhere far behind me. Before I could even turn my head around I heard the sound of rushing wind followed by a flash of cyan blazing through the sky above the dome leaving behind a rainbow contrail. </p><p>“Dash?” It was hard to tell with what little I saw, yet at the same time the rainbow streak was an obvious tell. I’m pretty sure magic was somehow involved, unless Twilight forgot to mention that pegasi also crapped rainbows.</p><p>With impossible speed the pegasus flew towards the falling guards right past the dragon before it could even react. I had expected she would attempt to catch the guards one by one, instead she dove down to a low altitude and started flying circles at high speed creating a halo of rainbow light. Despite how far she was I felt the wind around me stir and I could slowly feel it start to pick up speed and start to blow in her direction. I could make out what looked like a small sized tornado slowly growing in the center of the rainbow ring. High above I noticed clouds of various sizes from all around were being pulled in by the wind to gather and spin around the miniature twister. </p><p>“She’s making a bedding!” shouted Twilight. Before I could ask her what she meant, Rainbow Dash suddenly swerved off and flew away and without her maintaining the twister it immediately collapse upon itself sucking all the gathered clouds together. It then burst outwards like a smoke bomb creating a gigantic nimbus cloud just in time to catch the falling guards. </p><p>“HA!” I yelled ecstatically remembering what made pegasi so special. With magic they had near perfect control over the weather, allowing them to even walk freely on top of clouds. The cyan pegasus had simply created an entire island to catch all the guards in the span of a few seconds. The idea was simple by design but to actually pull it off all by herself....</p><p>“Go Rainbow Dash!” cheered Sweetie Belle. We watched as more guards fell into the cloud while Rainbow flew from one to another, likely making sure they wouldn’t fall on top of each other. “Isn’t she amazing?” </p><p>Before I could answer entire town shuddered as the earth suddenly shifted below us followed by a deep, loud gonging sound as if someone had struck a giant church bell. The townsfolk that had settled down were thrown into panic once again, screams and shouts suddenly intensifying from all around. I felt Sweetie Belle jump on my right leg, hugging it again to calm herself. </p><p>“What now!?” I shouted before gazing skywards only to see the dragon gone. “Where the hell did it-” another quake forced me to spread my legs for balance. I looked up and saw something ripple across the dome. Turning to where the source of the ripple originated I saw a giant green claw rise over the rooftops that then slammed down on the dome shaking the ground and creating yet another wavelet.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Looks like its taking a more direct approach.’</span> The dragon had landed on the eastern side of town, most of the buildings and houses were in the way but I could still make out some of its upper body. </p><p>“Can the shield hold it back?” I asked nervously. Considering the dragon’s sheer size and power, a single strike could easily take down any of the structures in town. Each strike sent shockwaves over the dome causing it to dim momentarily.</p><p>“Not for long.” As if to prove her point one of the golden lights connected to the dome suddenly cut off following another assault. I figured it meant the unicorn that the light was attached to had ran out of juice and simply couldn’t give anymore. </p><p>“Dammit! Is this backup even coming?!” Like the rest of the ponies in town I was starting to panic now that danger seemed eminent. </p><p>“I-I don’t know! But the chance of somepony in Canterlot becoming aware of the situation is extremely high, it’s almost impossible not to!” Twilight was trying her best to remain calm but it was evident that she too was starting to losing it. </p><p>“Is there some sort of evacuation plan?!” The earth shook again before one of the dark blue lights far to my left cut off. </p><p>“The lieutenant said something about getting everypony ready for evacuation but....” Several ripples reverberated across the dome as the dragon suddenly started bashing on the dome in quick succession causing three lights to disappear.  </p><p>“Well come on then!!” I yelled.</p><p>“But there’s no way we can out-gallop a dragon! What if the dragon decided to chase us down!?” Twilight fell to the ground with her hooves rubbing both sides of her head trying desperately to think up some kind of plan. “If only Princess Celestia was here! She’d know what to do.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Well I think she’s done. Might as well pack it up and leave.’</span></p><p><i>‘What are you-’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Much as I hate to say it, there’s really nothing else we can do now is there? We can just leave. Take our chances and make a run for it.’</span></p><p><i>‘Leave them to die!?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘What else is there to do?! There’s no possible way we can protect every one of these ponies!’</span> Looking up, I counted only six lights still remained connected to the dome. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Likely everyone will try and make a run for Canterlot, that’ll be our chance to hide out somewhere on the outskirts of town.’</span></p><p><i>‘Using them as bait?!’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh for crying out-YES! They’ll die! The dragon will fly over and rain fire down on every single one of them! But we get to live!! We have just enough magic left to reach the edge of town in time before the dome fails.’</span> </p><p>Another ripple, another light disappeared. </p><p><i>‘We can take-’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘No, we can’t. We don’t have enough magic to carry those two along. Look, just turn around...’</span></p><p>I hesitated for what felt like minutes with a tight chest, in truth the idea was extremely tempting. Eventually I turned to the right and looked down a street leading to a direct path to the edge of town. I heard the screams intensify in the distance and another light went out. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Now just take a step.’</span> </p><p>I placed my left feet in front of me.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘And another.’</span></p><p>I leaned forward and tried to bring my right leg to follow, but something heavy was keeping it tied down. </p><p>“Rodney?” Looking down I saw Sweetie Belle gazing up at me, still hugging me with those small hooves of hers. Her eyes was glistening with tears and a small strand of snot oozed from her nose to my pants. But it was her expression that caught me off guard, she still had hope that we would make it. But it wasn’t hope that Twilight would suddenly come up with a brilliant plan to save the day, or whether the Princesses would arrive just in time to rid the dragon. </p><p>It was at me. </p><p>Even after seeing the dragon turn the sky into fire and witnessing a group of trained guards get taken down, she still believed that I - out of everyone - would somehow keep her safe from harm.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘What are you waiting fo-’</span></p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We have no time for-’</span> </p><p>“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!!” I bent over with my eyes closed, arms pressing against the side of my head as I screamed atop my lungs. Before either pony could question my sanity I crouched down and pulled the filly from my leg causing her to yelp out in surprise. Her surprise instantly changed to confusion when I pulled her into a tight hug. </p><p>“Thank you.” It was all I said before quickly making my way towards Twilight and carefully placing the filly on her back. </p><p>“Rodney?” asked Twilight suspiciously, the same way she would often do when she thought I was about to do something stupid. </p><p>And I was. </p><p>“No time to talk.” I looked up to the dome just in time to see two more connections cut off simultaneously. “I’ll be needing some.”</p><p>“What are you tal-woah....” Twilight’s legs suddenly wobbled a bit as I siphoned a considerable amount of magic from her. Despite everything she did there was still plenty of magic left in her to fill me up to the point where I started to feel the headaches again. </p><p>“You two go find somewhere to hide.” I looked to Sweetie Belle who was standing on her rear hooves while she leaned over Twilight’s head. She was staring at me with a confused and worried expression, I guess she must’ve noticed that something was about to happen. </p><p>The earth shifted again as another ripple traveled through the dome creating several large cracks that cut through the dome like broken glass, it looked as if the sky itself was about to shatter. Amazingly enough the two remaining unicorns stubbornly held on, constantly feeding the dome with everything they had. Although the cracks on the dome slowly started to seal again, it was evident that it was at the brink of collapsing. </p><p>“I guess that’s it then.” I gave the two a smile before both my feet lit up with blue flames, lifting me up several inches above the ground. I turned and launched myself away from the two, picking up speed by using small burst of the propulsion spell like I did before. </p><p>“Rodney wait!!” Twilight yelled. “What are you planning to do!?” </p><p>“I have no freakin idea!!!” I could feel my heart beating hard against my chest, hear the blood pulsing in my ears while adrenaline flooded my veins. I was constantly being bombarded with doubts and urges to turn around, I ignored these by focusing entirely on advancing. Moving one foot in front of the other, my eyes locked forward, I never gave myself a moment to think or I would eventually hesitate and double back. </p><p>All the while the beast continued to grow in size as I closed in. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=====================================================================================</p></div><p>(AN: Nothing to do with the story, but a lot of the effects gives a good visual idea of what happened.

<p>So this took a while didn't it? </p><p>And it's only half of what I wanted too. In any case I hope you enjoy this chapter. It was definitely harder to write than the last. I had a good idea of the plot in that chapter which makes it easier. </p><p>Unfortunately for this one, I only knew what I wanted in the beginning and the end. Nothing planned in the between. Plus I had to make sure things progress chronologically, at least to a point where it's simple to follow. </p><p>In any case, I apologize for the lack of epic moments from Rodney. Though in a few instances in the past he has shown some quick thinking and action, this one is different. In my opinion heroes are created, not born. Which is why I tried so hard to push Rodney into a desperate scenario. </p><p>Hope it's not too cheesy. </p><p>And kudos to Hollyhock for all the hard work and putting up with me through the wee hours. </p><p>~Zai</p><p>P.S I HATE making sound effects from words.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 32 - Let’s see how annoying I can get<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock</p><hr/><p>“W-wait! Rodney!!” shouted Sweetie Bell as she watched him glide away. “Where is he going?”</p><p>“I...I think he’s trying to buy us more time,” answered Twilight, still staring at the human in the distance. It didn’t take long before he reached the end of the street, turned, and disappeared behind some buildings, only the vague glow of blue light from his magic gave her some estimate of his progress. Though that too quickly diminished.</p><p>“You mean he’s going to...” Sweetie Belle gazed for into the distance at the dragon. “Sh-shouldn’t we sto-” she stopped mid speech, realizing it was too late to do anything now. “Will he be alright? He can do it right?” the desperation in her voice was clear.</p><p><i>‘Will he?’</i> thought Twilight. This was the second time Twilight seriously considered removing the band, the first since the incident involving Rarity’s boutique. If what Princess Celestia said was true regarding his infinite potential, than he should be able to subdue the dragon with ease. Unfortunately that was no longer an option, even if she decided to remove the band it could only be done in close proximity.</p><p>“It’s alright Sweetie Belle, I’m sure he’ll be fine,” Twilight assured the filly before turning around and galloping down a different street, away from the dragon. The sudden movement surprised the filly causing her to yelp as she wrapped her hooves around Twilight’s neck lest she be thrown off.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” the mare apologized, “but we need to hurry. I need to get something from the-ah!” One of Twilight’s forehooves suddenly gave in mid stride from exhaustion nearly causing her to slip and tumble. The aftereffects of being drained was an unusual sensation, the loss of magic was so abrupt that her mind had yet to register her body’s sudden exhaustion. Luckily Twilight was able to regain her balance in time to skid across the ground.</p><p>“Are you ok Twilight?” asked the worried filly.</p><p>“Just tired,” Twilight let out a groan as she pushed herself back up.</p><p>Just as she was about to gallop on, there came another thundering roar from the dragon making her ears fold and close over her head. Twilight managed to gaze back at the dragon just as it struck the dome for the uptenth time creating more cracks on its surface and making the sky look like a fractured glass mural. </p><p>This time the dome dimmed to a point where it briefly vanished along with two of the three remaining lights keeping the dome alive. A lone golden light was all that kept the dome from collapsing, though it was extremely thin and weak and from the way the dome kept dimming in and out of existence showed how truly fragile it was. With a triumphant roar the dragon lifted both of its claws in a grip and slammed them simultaneously upon the dome. Like glass, it shattered into countless shards of varying sizes falling several feet before evaporating away to nonexistence.</p><p>Twilight gazed at the dragon with renewed fear. “Oh no.”</p><hr/><p>“Ah shit!”</p><p>I stared at what remained of the dome as it fell and evaporated into thin air, I had hoped to distract the dragon before the dome broke but there was simply not enough time. Not that it would matter, in order to reach the dragon I had to go through the damn thing anyways and that meant draining the magic. One way or another, that dome was going down.</p><p>The best scenario would be for me to engage the dragon just before it started rampaging through town. I might have been able to do so had I taken the most direct route but that meant charging at it in plain sight which would likely kill me. Thus I took an alternate path about two blocks away that would let me sneak past and come around from behind. At least the ponies had the sense to keep as far away from the dragon as possible, so far I haven’t seen a single soul in this part of town. Unfortunately it looks like the town would suffer some damage, considering what I’m up against I suppose that’s inevitable. </p><p>The ground shook accompanied by the sounds of destruction as the first building fell while a great column of dust and debris fly high above the rooftops. I could feel small bits of wood and dirt fall on me like heavy rain, the destruction caused the ponies somewhere deeper in town to scream in panic louder than ever. I silently cursed at their stupidity, screaming aloud like that would only attract the dragon’s attention. </p><p>With that thought I quickly got back on track and quicken my pace as another building turned to ruin. Soon as I reached the last street I grabbed hold of a nearby lamp post to act as an anchor allowing me to make a tight turn. The light suddenly turned off as I felt a small trickle of magic travel up my arm. I knew that the actual light came from a small gem that acted as a light bulb but it never occurred to me that the lamp post itself had a magical link to it, I has always thought I had to jump and touch the gem in order to drain it. With a chuckle I extended my hand to the side touching every single one of the lamp posts, extinguishing them and darkening the street as I passed by to replenish what magic I had used. However, the light spells they used for street lamps consume little magic so each posts only had a small supply of it. Still, they came in plenty enough to make some difference though I had to be careful not to accidently get my chains snagged along the way.</p><p>Soon enough I spotted the dragon through the buildings. From the angle I figured that I’d come out from right behind if I took the next intersection. I cut off the maglev spell and skidded to a halt just a few meters away from the next street before jumping to a nearby alley. I leaned my back against the wall with my eyes closed taking in slow steady breaths to calm myself. </p><p>Much as I tried to it was almost impossible to remain calm while hearing the dragon’s loud thumping steps shaking the ground that constantly reminded me of its size. My hands and legs wouldn’t stop shaking, making the chains rattle while my heart kept beating hard as if it wanted to burst out of my chest.</p><p><i>‘Last chance to talk me out of it.’</i> I waited for a few seconds yet the familiar voice never replied. <i>‘Seriously? Shit is about to happen and you’re giving me the silent treatment now!?’</i></p><p>Nothing. For once my mind was silent as if it was my own again. Strangely that somehow unnerved me.</p><p><i>‘Guess I’m on my own then.’</i> As if the things wasn’t bad enough, my body was also giving me problems.</p><p>“Dammit I need to pee.” I continued with my steady breathing while trying to recollect and prepare myself for what could be my last moments.</p><p><i>‘Magnet. Maglev. Levitation. Propulsion. Shield.’</i></p><p><i>‘Magnet. Maglev. Levitation. Propulsion. Shield.’</i></p><p><i>‘Magnet. Maglev. Levitation. Propulsion. Shield.’</i></p><p>I kept repeating these spells in my mind like a religious mantra recalling every memory I’d had with them so far. I brought them all to the forefront of my mind, even all the crazy untested and purely hypothetical ideas that I’d ever thought of. </p><p>Propulsion and Maglev was obvious,  I’ll likely rely on that one to get around and keep me alive. I can’t quite think of a use for the Levitation and Magnet spell yet, though I’m sure they’ll still be useful for something. </p><p>It was a pathetically small list and I should’ve invested more time in actual spellweaving than simply brainstorming wild ideas, but it was all I had and I’d managed to get by so far. Then again the odds had never been so stacked against me, all the things that I had been through were child’s play compared to what’s coming.</p><p>I let out a sigh. “Really should’ve kept that sapphire around.” It had design flaws and was far from perfect but it would have served as a immense supply of magic, something that could easily save my life. </p><p>The dragon roared just as the ground gave a violent shake and a large shadow covered the alley I was in. Looking up I caught a glimpse of an entire building - still mostly intact - flying over the rooftops deeper into town. It actually took several seconds before I heard it crash somewhere far away.</p><p><i>‘It just chucked a whole building halfway across town...’</i> I slid down against the wall to a crouch as my whole body trembled in fear. I hugged my legs trying to comfort myself but it did little to ease the shivers. </p><p>“Heh....hehahahahahahaha!” Tears came out as I laughed at the insanity of the situation. “Oh god! What the hell am I doing!?”</p><p><i>‘Alright, just calm down. I don’t actually have to fight the damn thing. Just distract it and buy as much time as I can. So.....’</i> I pushed myself up to stand and slowly made my way back out to the street. The edge of my lips slightly curled upwards to a small smile. </p><p>“Let’s see how annoying I can get.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sometime ago...]=========</p></div><p>“Twilight!” Spike ran up to the purple mare as soon as she entered the library with a small white filly on her back. “And....Sweetie Belle?”</p><p>“She’s back!?” A light brown earth mare came cantering in from the kitchen carrying what looked like a box of various fruits with liquid containers. Seeing Twilight’s exhausted state she quickly sprinted towards her dropping the box and spilling the contents across the floor.</p><p>Twilight moved further into the library before her limbs gave in to exhaustion, collapsing to the wooden floor in a tired heap drenched in sweat looking completely spent with her tongue slightly poking out of her mouth. Sweetie Belle quickly slid off the mare’s back as Spike made a dash towards the kitchen while Shine Bright carefully inspected Twilight for any injuries.</p><p>“Are you hurt ma’am? Your assistant mentioned a dragon?! The royal guards have ordered a complete evacuation!”</p><p>“Uhm....who are you?” asked Sweetie Belle.</p><p>“It’s ok Sweetie Belle....this is Shine Bright....she’s from the castle,” spoke Twilight as she fought for breath. “Shine, could you...” Twilight pointed towards the filly with a glance.</p><p>“Eh, hi there Sweetie Belle.” Shine Bright moved to stand beside her. “Why don’t we get cleaned up a bit hm?” Sweetie Belle turned to Twilight with an unsure look which she replied with a smile and a nod. With some hesitation Sweetie Belle followed the mare away from Twilight just as Spike returned carrying a pitcher of water.</p><p>“Here you go Twilight.” He carefully tipped the rim to her open mouth letting her drink the cool water. “So what happened? I saw the dragon break the-” Spike fell silent and pulled back the pitcher as Twilight started coughing.</p><p>“No time to-kha! Explain Spike. I need you to get something from the basement. It’s in the middle cabinet, on the third drawer and all the way in the back.”</p><p>“But maybe I can talk to him. You know, dragon to dragon.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’ll work. And I don’t want you risking your life”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“Spike please, there’s no time.” With an pleading look from Twilight, Spike placed the pitcher on the floor and scampered away disappearing around the corner.</p><p>As Twilight laid her head down to rest she heard the sound of hoofsteps approach her. Too tired to move, Twilight simply waited motionless until Shine Bright appeared in her field of vision. Noticing that Shine was alone, Twilight looked confusedly at her.</p><p>“She fell asleep on the floor before I could even find the brush,” Shine explained. “I settled her in your bed. She must have been exhausted what with everything that’s happened.” Shine Bright gazed around the main library room searching for something. “Where’s your assistant?”</p><p>Right on cue they heard the baby dragon’s irritated voice as he scramble up the stairs. “Arrgh! Stop it! Peewee!” Spike appeared out of the corner carrying a large box of dark oak in his claws while a bright red baby phoenix kept hopping around his legs like a puppy waiting for a treat. “Dude a little help here?” he asked looking up to the second level.</p><p>Shine heard a hoot just before a grayish owl glided down from above to land next to Spike. With another hoot Owlowiscious stretched out his right wing and wrapped it around the phoenix like a blanket bringing him close. Like an older sibling he then started hooting as if lecturing the phoenix on his behaviour.</p><p>“Thanks Owlowiscious,” thanked Spike. He quickly walked around the two birds and settled the box down in front of Twilight. “So what’s inside that’s so important? I found Peewee in the drawer pecking at it. Not sure how he managed to get in.” True to his words the box was covered in scratches and minor pecking marks.</p><p>Without answering Twilight closed her eyes and concentrated as she cast the matching key spell. Spike and Shine watched with interest as the box started glowing a dull purple hue, a series of metallic clinking noise could be heard as locks began disengaging one by one. As the last lock released the lid popped open slightly allowing Twilight to flip the lid open with the tip of her muzzle. </p><p>Inside was a white hardbound book beautifully embroidered with gold lines around the edges. Next to it lay another wooden box though this one had what looked like metal running through grooves over the surface creating a very intricate design. For Spike who lived his entire life assisting a scholarly pony like Twilight, he immediately recognized the design as a magical rune. But as to its purpose he did not know. </p><p>“Spike could you please...,” spoke Twilight in a tired tone as she gazed at the smaller box. The dragon reached out and pulled open the lid with his claws. The entire library was suddenly bathed in bright blue light radiating out of a moderately sized sapphire. </p><p>“Who~aa...,” was all Spike could say as he squinted at the sapphire. It didn’t take long before he started salivating like a dog as he licked his lips.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” spoke Shine in a low amazed voice. She was just as captivated as the purple dragon, save for the drooling. “I didn’t know gems can shine like that.”</p><p>“More importantly,” Spike lapped his lips audibly, “can I have a bite?”</p><p>“Spike, no! Rodney needs it!”</p><p>Shine Bright’s ears twitch at the name. “Rodney? You mean the human?”</p><p>“What’s he got to do with all this?” Spike asked.</p><p>“The royal guards were trying to buy as much time until reinforcements arrive from Canterlot. But they couldn’t, not for long.” Twilight closed her eyes and let out a sigh. “Rodney’s trying to do the same.”</p><p>“What!?” Shine’s eyes shot wide open as a sense of alarm came over her.</p><p>“He can fight a full grown dragon!? Cool!!” Spike exclaimed.</p><p>“No he can’t!!” Twilight shouted. “Look there’s no time left! Rodney’s about to fight the dragon all by himself and he’s going to need all the help he can get!” Twilight clenched her teeth together as she tried to get back on her hooves. “I ugh, need to get this to him.”</p><p>“But you’re completely exhausted!” Spike argued. “You can barely move!”</p><p>“How....how bad does he need it?” asked Shine in a nervous tone.</p><p>“It could mean the difference between life or death,” answered Twilight in a resigning tone. “He has a lot of magic, more than most unicorns even, but it’s still nothing compared to a dragon.”</p><p>Being aware of the human’s unique ability Twilight kept hoping that somehow Rodney would be able to surprise her again, surprise and awe her as he did in the past. But as much as she wished, Twilight was also an intellect. With all that she knew of the human and what he could do, she could calculated the most probable outcome. Even with the best circumstances he would be lucky to make it out alive. </p><p><i>‘Unless he could somehow siphon the dragon’s entire reserve of magic in one fell swoop.....,’</i> she thought. <i>‘ Bui even if he could do it, he won’t. Not with that band on him.’</i></p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>“What?” Twilight turned to stare at Shine unsure if she heard right.</p><p>“I’ll take the gem.” There was a moment of silence as Twilight regarded the earth pony.</p><p>“But why would you....”</p><p>“I-I don’t...I mean, I was sent here to watch over the human by Princess Celestia herself.” Shine started to fidget with her forehooves nervously. “If he get’s hurt or, the Sun forbid, uhm...dies. Then that’s it right? She might think that I failed....or something.”</p><p>It was evidently clear to Twilight that Shine was making up her reasons as she goes. Nevertheless Twilight could tell she was serious. What’s more confusing was how she felt about it. Of course she felt relieved that someone would do it instead of her; worry that Bright would hurt herself in the process; and even egotistic about letting somepony help you. But what stood out amongst them all, was that she also felt suspicious of the mare. </p><p><i>‘Why would she do something so dangerous for him? Is it really because of the Princess? Granted I’d do anything for Princess Celestia as well but....’</i> Twilight quickly discarded these thoughts, believing her mind was simply muddled with exhaustion.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Spike asked. Shine gave him a nod. “But how will you even find him?”</p><p>They heard the distant yet powerful roar of the dragon drawing their attention to the window. Several seconds later they saw an entire building crash into the neighbouring houses with a thundering clamour.</p><p>“Right, the dragon,” Spike continued, “Stupid question.”</p><hr/><p>“Alright, here goes nothing.” With my heart still racing I slowly poked my head out from the corner of the intersection, just enough to get a full view of the dragon. </p><p>“Holy shit,” I whispered. From the glimpses I caught along the way I can approximate its size but seeing it with a clear view is something else entirely. Now I wanted nothing more than to just turn around and  run. </p><p>Taller than my apartment building back home, the dragon was a pillar of scale and muscle. Its green scales were sticking out in a slant making its entire body one giant shredder, I could easily imagine myself getting torn up and minced if I rub against it in the wrong way. As if that weren’t enough it also had these fin like spikes running across its back. Whether or not they were as sharp as they look didn’t matter, I have every intention to avoid it and never find out. </p><p>What caught my attention the most however, was its tail. Far thicker than me, it could easily crush a car or even a bus. The way it moved was like watching a giant serpent dance and curl about with the dragon’s movement. A serpent with gigantic green spikes protruding from it’s head, each roughly as thick as my thigh and every one of them were long enough to impale me through. Vertically. </p><p>While I was busy staring at the behemoth from the corner, it plowed through two entire buildings with a single swing of its claw. I was curious as to why it didn’t simply fly back up and rain fire on the town like it tried before, there nothing protecting the town now. Maybe it simply wanted to enjoy the moment or torment the ponies longer. Whatever the reason I was grateful it decided to stay on the ground, otherwise there was nothing that I or anyone else could to stop it. </p><p>“Ok, just stick to the plan,” I spoke through gritted teeth. “Just hit and run. Hit and run.” </p><p>I looked down at my feet making sure the maglev spell was still there before holding my left hand out. With both my ‘Sense’ and ‘Sight’ activated I allowed a sizable amount of magic to flow out of my hand in a shape of a sphere. It grew quickly and within seconds I had a ball of fire the size of a dodge ball burning azure in my hand. It was roughly the same size as the one I used to snuff out the fire in Twilight’s kitchen. I was rather hesitant to use so much magic on the first go, I didn’t even know whether or not it’ll have any effect on the dragon. But at least it was guaranteed to get its attention, it might be resistant to fire but not the explosion. </p><p>The moment I stepped out into the ruined street I quickly twisted my body to face the dragon and with a grunt I threw the fireball right at its back. Luckily accuracy meant jack due the size of my adversary, so long as I aim at its general direction I had a good chance of scoring a hit. </p><p>All the noise and sensation of the world suddenly became muffled and distant, with great trepidation I watched my fireball fly towards the dragon’s back. Just like the incident back in the castle where I accidently threw a fireball into Luna’s bedroom, gravity seem to have little influence on magic allowing the flaming projectile to fly in a relatively straight arc. It flew past the dragon’s tail and I saw it hit squarely just above where the right wing protruded from the body. </p><p>I heard the booming explosion a second earlier before the force hit me like a wall of heat. I folden both arms over my face to protect myself against rock, wood, and various debris that pelted at me like hail. For about a second I saw the street in front of me completely engulfed in varying shades of blue fire illuminating the area for the briefest moment before it finally ebbed and disappeared. </p><p>“God. DAMN!” I knew that my raw magic would result in an explosion but never did I imagine it could be so.....destructive. I felt a small sliver of hope, that maybe there was a chance, a real possibility that I could do this. Actually fight and win against dragon. </p><p>But as soon as the fire disappeared and the dust settled down, hope turned to dread. The dragon’s back was completely unblemished, its scales still retain their luster with absolutely no trace of any damage whatsoever. An explosion that could easily destroy an small concrete house did absolutely nothing against it. </p><p>Then I saw it, I wished to god that I hadn’t but it was impossible not to. Larger than my head I stared into its slitted yellow eyes that seem to glow with ferocity. I was frozen in place under its gaze, I was paralyzed in absolute numbing fear that stole all cognitive thought from me. I felt my body jerk as my feet fell to the ground when the maglev spell disappeared along with my focus. </p><p>Even as the dragon turned around with its tail lashing out to the side destroying more homes, I remain rooted in place with fear gripping my insides. It just looked at me for a moment, examining me for what felt like an eternity. The only sensation that I felt at that moment was the cold night air against my skin, the ground beneath my feet, and the sudden warmth that seem to spread from my crotch. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'What the hell are you waiting around for!? </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">RUN!!!</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'</span></p><p>It was like being brought back from the dead, I felt the beat of my heart again while the whole world seem to rush back overloading my senses. My brain went on overdrive firing up all my nerves as I exploded into a series of motion. </p><p>I turned around and took a step which never returned to the ground as I reactivated my maglev spell. Without thinking I collected made another yet smaller fireball in my right hand, roughly the size of a baseball, and threw it in a backhanded motion behind me. By the time I heard the explosion I had launched myself to a decent speed with a push from my propulsion spell.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'What makes you think a smaller one would do any better? Stop wasting magic!'</span></p><p>The dragon’s roar stung my ears like a needle, forcing me to cover them with my hands while I kept picking up speed as I hover across the ruined street. I was so focused on getting away that it took me some time to realize that something was missing. Hesitantly I turned my head to look behind me to see the dragon had not given chase, it even turned its back at me and was already busy tearing through another building. </p><p>“The hell?” I terminated the maglev and skidded across the street to a halt. “Why isn’t it chasing!?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I guess you haven’t provoked it enough. After all you barely did anything to it.’</span></p><p>“And where the hell have you been!?” I shouted angrily. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Hey I’ve got a right to be pissed at you! What the fuck were you thinking!? We could’ve just left and lived BUT NO~O! You gotta be the hero!’</span></p><p>“Shut up! I-”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So now here we are against something that will surely kill us! And we can’t even die with dignity now that you’ve gone and wet yourself!!’</span> I looked down and sure enough the area around my crotch was soaking wet. </p><p>“Damn I really did-ah whatever! That’s not important! I still need to figure out how get that dragon away from the town.” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Try shouting at it.’</span></p><p>“What? How would that accomplish anything!?” I started pacing back and forth as I racked my brain for ideas. One of the stone tiles I stepped on suddenly gave way taking my feet with it. Before I could pull it back out I felt it dip into something thick and wet, once I pulled it out a sudden foul yet familiar smell assaulted my nose. </p><p>“Ah shit!!” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Shit is right.’</span> </p><p>My entire shoe was completely covered in what could only be manure based on the smell since it’s used as fertilizer back home. Except this one smelled far worse and considering this was a town for ponies, I probably stepped on a sewer pipe that got ruptured by the dragon. </p><p>Then an idea popped into my head. </p><p>“I hope no one sees this.” I extended a hand towards the crevice. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Why?’</span></p><p>“Cause then they’ll never stop calling me monkey.” </p><p>I emptied my lungs and took a deep breath before I started levitating chunks of manure and what could only me horse urine out from the crack. I gathered it to a lump a good distance away from me which unfortunately wasn’t enough to keep the smell away. I heard another clamour from the distance as the dragon threw another house deeper to town, I can only hope that anyone in the vicinity of the landing got away in time. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You might want to pick up the pace. We don’t know how long it’ll remain on the ground.’</span></p><p>“Didn’t you say you wanted nothing to do with this?” I asked as pulled my shirt to cover my nose. The ball of pony waste had grew to the size of a large beach ball and was growing faster as I levitated more manure quicker than before. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I never said that.’</span> I could hear him let out a sigh in my mind though I’m not sure how that worked. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Look it’s done. You’re committed to this so I might as well do what I can to make sure the both of us make it.’</span> </p><p>“......Thanks.” I laughed a little. “Oh god I’m actually thanking a voice in my head. Well I guess that makes it official, my sanity is fucked up.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Alright I think that’s enough of that crap.’</span></p><p>“What are you embarrassed of gratitude?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘What? No! Hell that doesn’t even make any sense! I’m talking about actual crap. I think we’ve got enough.’</span> I looked at the giant floating sphere of manure which had now grown to the size of a small car and thanks to the spell it also looked like it was lit on fire. </p><p>“Right.” I actually felt a strange form of pride when I look at it. “C’mon let’s do this quick, I’m wasting magic just keeping it afloat.” I could ‘feel’ my magic dwindle every second the longer I levitate something so heavy. </p><p>My feet burned once again and a second later I felt them leave the ground as the maglev spell came to full effect. Not daring to waste anymore magic I kicked off without the help of a propulsion spell while my giant collection of wet manure followed behind. At least now I don’t have to smell the damn thing. </p><p>It was slow but I kept picking up speed along the way to reach the dragon in half a minute. Rethinking my strategy I realized it would be impossible to actually keep the levitation alive until it hits the dragon, in order to do that I would have to be right within the range of its tail. So with some quick thinking moved to the side while the manure continued to travel in the center. Fortunately it seem the dragon had disregarded me entirely and was busy rampaging through town to notice what’s coming till it’s too late. Especially since my feet weren’t touching the ground. The only audible sound I was making were my heavy breathing and the jingling of my chains. I doubt the dragon could hear both over the destruction it was wreaking on the town. </p><p>Soon as I got close enough I dispelled my maglev and came to a halt while maintaining the levitation spell on the manure. Without disrupting its momentum I lifted the manure as it passed by making it soar upwards towards the dragon’s back. I tried as much as I could to keep the levitation spell together but unlike my fireball or active spells it needs to be kept in control by the caster, and that control become far harder to hold over longer distances. Once it got out of my mental reach the spell broke apart and with nothing holding it together the manure started to spread out. </p><p>Seconds before it hit I stuck my thumb and index finger into my mouth and blew out the loudest whistle I could make. The dragon turned around just as all the manure started raining down on it, covering nearly half of its face while most landed on its back and wing. </p><p><b>“ARGH!! That’s disgusting!!”</b> it bellowed. It thrashed about unfurling its wings spraying the manure all over the place. <b>“You wretched little-”</b> </p><p>KABOOM!</p><p>By the time the fireball hit its face I was already running away with my malev back on. I had hoped the explosion would mask or disrupt the dragon long enough to give me a head start. </p><p><b>“RAAAAGH!!”</b> I actually felt its roar hit my back before the ground started to rumble violently. Rubble and various objects all vibrated about with the dragon’s pace, this time I was certain it was chasing me. Especially since it sounded like I was running away from an avalanche, one that was quickly gaining on me. </p><p>Glancing back I saw the dragon had fallen to all fours tearing through the stone street wrecking havoc with each stride. What I didn’t expect was to see its three inch razor sharp teeth bearing so close to me. I could almost see my reflection on them. </p><p><b>“It was a mistake letting you live! I should have dealt with you sooner!”</b> it shouted. As loud as it was I barely registered what it said, I was simply far too engrossed in getting away. </p><p>Despite how fast I was going it was impossible for me to outrun the dragon, its long stride simply outpaced my speed. A direct fight seemed inevitable. </p><p>Making the first move I swerved to the side of the street just before I passed an intersection. The lamp post at the very end had been severely bent but luckily its foundation was still buried in the ground. I stretched out my left hand to grab the post and with it acting as an anchor I was able to make a sharp turn. </p><p>“Ghaa!” I shouted painfully through gritted teeth. Unfortunately with my current speed holding unto the post was extremely painful, had I been traveling any faster I might’ve dislocated my shoulder. From the corner of my eye I saw the dragon’s maw bite down just where I was a second ago with a loud snap. Realizing that I had just dodged the jaws of death, the pain in my arm and shoulder seem to disappear entirely. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So what’s the plan?’</span></p><p>“Staying alive sounds pretty good for now!” Fortunately the dragon had slipped trying to make the same turn, despite being on all four it was still far less agile than I am. I made a mental note of that. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We can’t keep this up for long. Eventually we’ll run out of magic and when that happens-’</span></p><p>“I’m dead! Yeah I figured.” Though the manure had worked it was also heavy and took a lot of magic to carry. By my estimate I had burned through half of my entire supply of magic. “I’ll have to find a way to fill up!” Of course my first thought was to drain the dragon itself. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Don’t be stupid that’ll get us killed! You damn well we can only-’</span></p><p>“Drain something when I’m near it, I know!” So far my ‘Sense’ and ‘Sight’ could only detect magic in a five meter radius of me, meaning I can’t drain something that I can’t ‘feel’ or ‘see’. Getting that close is-</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Complete suicide! Besides I seriously doubt we can drain it completely. From what we’ve seen that thing has got some serious magic going on.’</span></p><p>“Guess I’ve just gotta scrounge up whatever I can-”</p><p><b>“You will not escape!”</b> Looking back I saw the dragon was plowing through the buildings as it resumed the chase, I could see brown splotches still covering some parts of his body. <b>“I’ll take your life for this insult!”</b></p><p>“Shit!” I shouted without thinking which provoked the dragon even further. </p><p><b>“You dare!!”</b> With renewed ferocity it charged at me wrecking the street with each step and knocking down walls of buildings as it passed by. It was catching up fast again and looking ahead at the next intersection in the distant I realized there was no way I could make it in time. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Alley to the right!’</span></p><p>“I see it!” An idea came to mind and I quickly prepared a small fireball in my hand and I threw it at the ground just before reaching the alley. The explosion wasn’t anything impressive but it did kicked up a stone and dust into the air to act as a smoke screen. Not wanting to risk it see me I ended the maglev spell killing the fire in my feet, making it harder for it to spot me past all the cloud of dust. </p><p>I slid across the stone pavement and dove out of the street, into the alley landing on trash and various discarded items. My body followed the motion and without thinking I tucked my head in allowing me to roll over before coming back on my feet. I was genuinely surprised by that, even if it was entirely out of reflex. </p><p>Too bad I wasn’t able to appreciate the moment. The walls around me shook violently as the dragon pass by knocking off random objects from the windowsills above. I held my breath and remained frozen in place fearing any movement would jingle my chains and betray my position. Eventually I heard the dragon’s trampling come to a stop somewhere down the street. </p><p><b>“Come out Kindling!”</b> it roared.</p><p>“Kindling?” I mouthed silently.</p><p><b>“You cannot hide from me!”</b> I felt the ground shake and I could hear the dragon’s pounding steps getting closer and closer. Suddenly I saw the side of its face appear out the corner with it’s large reptilian yellow eye looking right at me. </p><p><b>“I can smell you Kindling,”</b> it growled menacingly. At that moment nothing in this world or mine had terrified me more than the dragon’s low calm voice. I frantically got back on my feet and turned around ready to run for the other end of the alley, only to see my mistake. </p><p>Out of all the alleyways, this one lead to a dead end. </p><p><b>“Where will you run now?”</b> mocked the dragon. Looking back I saw it smile at me victoriously revealing giant fangs and rows of serrated teeth similar to that of sharks. </p><p>My first instinct was to try and climb over the brick wall but that would take far too long, it was as tall as the buildings around me which were several times my height. Even if I could climb over it would simply take too long and the dragon would have plenty of time to kill me in any number of ways by then. </p><p>Then I thought about just destroying the wall entirely with a fireball but I don’t know how much of an explosion it would take. If I recklessly use too much magic the walls would funnel the explosion towards me, I would be stunned and in the mercy of the dragon. Use too little and the wall would still stand, by then the dragon will realize my intent and lunge for me before I could do anything else. </p><p>As for the next idea.....</p><p><i>‘You thinking what I’m thinking?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Obviously. Go for it.’</span> With that I made a small fireball in my hand. </p><p><b>“Trully?”</b> asked the dragon surprised. <b>“You know just as well there’s nothing you can do at this point.”</b> Another fireball of the same size appeared on my other hand. <b>“I admire your will to survive, but there’s nothing-”</b></p><p>KABOOM!</p><p>Both fireballs hit the ground simultaneously between me and the dragon creating a smokescreen of dust and dirt that spread through the entire alley. </p><p><b>“Where will you hide Kindling? You are trapped.”</b> </p><p>Of course I know that....</p><p>“What makes you think I’m trying to hide?”</p><p>….which is why I’m going for the offensive. Though the dust cloud enshrouded me from the dragon, it also made it difficult for me to actually see anything as well. Except for a large yellowish tint in front of me. </p><p><b>“What nonsense are you-”</b> before the dragon could get another word out I quickly created another fireball and hurled it as fast as I could. </p><p>Right at the dragon’s eye. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.75em">“WRAAAAAAAAGH!!!”</span> The dragon pulled its head away from the alley roaring in pain. </p><p>Out of the dust cloud I ran like a bat outta hell just in time to see the dragon staggering back with its claws covering one side of its face. The moment I got back to the street I made a sharp left turn and immediately got back on maglev before launching myself with a small boost of propulsion. I could hear the dragon crash against the buildings on the other side of the street flattening them and shaking the ground. </p><p>“You’re not completely covered in scales!!” I shouted back. I was surprised to hear myself taunt the dragon like that, until recently I’ve been completely petrified by fear to even talk to the creature. Perhaps I was slowly adapting to the situation or the shock was starting to wear off. Whatever the reason didn’t really matter right now, I discarded the thought and focused back on fleeing for my life. </p><p><b>“ENOUGH!!”</b> Glancing back I saw the dragon had not only picked itself back up but was also pointing its open maw right at me. Realizing what’s coming I pushed myself even faster and was confident that I would reach the intersection before the coming inferno. </p><p>Seconds later I could hear the fire spewing out of its maw behind me. I knew I should just focus on reaching the intersection but after several seconds of hearing the fire raging behind me I couldn’t help but look back. Instead of seeing a wall of fire coming at me like an avalanche I saw a great multitude of bright yellowish fireballs hot at my heels. Literally. </p><p>“Oh shit!!” With a series of propulsion spells propelling me faster than ever and within seconds I was able to reach the intersection. </p><p>Unfortunately my speed made grabbing the lamp post like before impossible lest I want to dislocate all the bones in my arm. I was forced to use more magic on more propulsion spells as I slide to the left in an arc while pivoting my body against the turn to stay upright. In a way it made my feet appear to explode in bluish flames with every stride. </p><p>As impressive as it was I knew my efforts were in vain. Like missiles those fireballs turned the corner and was homing at me. Worse yet, they were able to make a tighter turn and was closer than ever, only about five or six meters away. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘They’re gaining on us!’</span> Out of desperation I threw my own fireball over my shoulder and hoped for a miracle. </p><p>Whether it hit the ground or any of the chasing fireballs I wasn’t sure, but what I did see was an explosion that sent bits of fractured stone tiles flying to the air. What happened after, I couldn’t be sure. I suspect the dragon’s fireballs were designed to explode on impact whether or not what they hit was the intended target.</p><p>The only thing I was certain off was hearing what sounded like a hail of mortars landing behind me and being hit in the back by the force of the explosions. I was violently thrown forward several feet before hitting the ground like a ragdoll. I remembered hitting my head, landing on my right side, then my left, and seeing the town upside down several times before everything finally stopped spinning.</p><p>There was a loud constant ringing in my ears the seem to snuff out every other sound while my mind was teetering on the brink of consciousness. God knows how long I laid on my back on the ground completely dazed and out of it. Eventually my sense came back to me and I was nearly sent to shock by the sudden waves of pain that seem to radiate from every part of my body. I could barely hear myself groan over the constant ringing as I try to flip myself over which only seem to intensify the pain, it’s like my body was screaming at me to just lay still. </p><p>But I pushed through the pain, still very much aware of the danger that was coming. I spat the blood in my mouth getting rid of the iron taste before finally pushing myself up to my feet. It was difficult to keep myself from falling back down against the whirling sensation while my body felt sluggish like there was a lag in my nervous system. But eventually the ringing in my ears started to go away and things slowly started to kick back into gear. </p><p>Only to lose my balance and fall when the ground gave a sudden violent shake that created large cracks on the buildings nearby, . I felt a sudden gust of wind hit me before a massive dust cloud fell on me along with a hail of stone that pelted me from above. As the dust started to settle I saw a large crater which used to be part of the street with a massive shadow standing in the middle looming over me. </p><p>Before I could get back up I felt something hit me in the chest knocking the air out of my lungs. I screamed in pain as a gigantic mass of green scales and muscle pressed me against the earth before wrapping around my body pinning both arms to my side. It was when I felt my body rise to the air did I realize the dire situation I was in. </p><p><b>“I have you now Kindling!”</b> bellowed the dragon as he held me in its grip. I looked up to see the dragon snarling at me with one eye closed and oozing with blood. <b>“I almost lost an eye thank to you!”</b> I felt my ribs pressing against my organs as the dragon started tightening its grip making me shout loudly in pain. </p><p>“KINDLING!!” I shouted atop my lungs. This was the only idea that I could come up with to postpone what could have been my death. I felt the pressure come to a halt. “Why-ugh, why did you call me Kindling!?” I shouted again. Relief came when the dragon’s grip start to loosen allowing me to breath more freely. </p><p>There was a silence as it regarded me for a moment and in that time I came to realize what I was going up against. To say a dragon is magical was an understatement in the greatest extent. Unlike ponies or even Celestia, they had this ‘fire’ burning inside their center mass like a second heart where their magic seem to be contained. But not for dragons it seems, their magic was spread completely throughout their body. With my ‘Sight’ I could even see magic inside the many veins in the dragon’s claw, magic seemed to be carried along in its blood like oxygen. The amount of magic flowing was staggering and this was just in the claw the held me, who knows how much more it had as a whole. If I could somehow 'see' the dragon entirely, I'd imagine it would appear as a walking manifestation of fire. </p><p><b>&quot;A mere name I have chosen to call you,&quot;</b> growled the dragon.</p><p>&quot;You talk as if you know me!&quot; I continued. &quot;But I'm pretty sure this is the first time we've met!&quot;</p><p><b>&quot;Oh but we have met,&quot;</b> he answered. <b>&quot;I am Falnor and I reside in the Everfree, and I witnessed your arrival.&quot;</b> There was a pause as I try to comprehend what he meant.</p><p>&quot;My arrival? You mean how I got here!?&quot; Despite being in his mercy I felt a sudden surge of rage. &quot;Were you the one that brought me here!?!&quot; I shouted angrily.</p><p>Falnor snarled at me as his grip tightened making me scream again. <b>&quot;Even if I was capable of such a feat, I would NEVER bring an abomination such as you into this world!!&quot;</b> It became difficult to breath now that my lungs couldn't expand properly making my breath short and ragged. </p><p><b>&quot;I saw it! Out of darkness you came and the world howled in pain!!&quot;</b> I could feel the bones in my body bending against the pressure threatening to break while the chains on my arms was pressed painfully against my sides. </p><p><b>&quot;I considered ending your life there, you were weak and I made the mistake thinking the animals of the Everfree will be your end. But like a kindling you started an inferno that even I cannot touch! You would have consumed this world had the Sisters not intervened!&quot;</b> It was slowly getting harder and harder for me to discern what he was saying, my mind mind was fogging up while my body started to go numb. </p><p><b>&quot;But clearly they are unaware of the danger they harbor. Unaware of the corruption you spread over this world or they would have ended your life that night. I have swore to never intervene in their business. But then again, I also gave my word never to harm any of their precious ponies. So what difference does it make now?&quot;</b> My vision was starting to fail along with my consciousness, but just before everything went dark I heard someone scream in the distance. </p><p>&quot;HANG IN THERE MONKEY!!!&quot; With what little consciousness I had, I tilted my head back towards the voice just in time to see what looked like a giant bronze plate hurtling down at Falnor’s head. </p><p>I heard a loud CLANG as it collided right in the back of the head sending sparks and broken scales flying about in random directions. I was too near to unconscious to realize what was happening, but I would guess Falnor must’ve jerked and thrown me out of reflex because the next thing I knew I was flying through the air. All I can remember for certain was freefalling for several seconds before finally hitting the ground. </p><p>Despite my harsh fall I felt relief now that my organs weren’t being turn to mush and I could finally get a full breath into my lungs. Unfortunately as the numbness in my body went away it brought back waves of fresh new pain which made it extremely difficult for me to move. I was laying on my side in an awkward position and I couldn’t muster up the will to move against the pain. </p><p>At least I could still see the dragon. With my head lying sideways I could saw him stumbling trying to stay keep his balance only to fall flat on its belly, crushing buildings unfortunate enough to be in the way. A gust of wind carrying dust from the impact hit me, forcing me to close my eyes and cough. The next moment I heard something heavy and metallic drop to the ground next to me and with my ‘Sense’ I could tell it was pony, or at least something living and not a dragon. I felt something push my shoulder so that I could lay on my back and gaze up at whoever it was. </p><p>“You dead?” asked a familiar voice. I answered with a moan. “You’re tougher than you look Rodney.” The moment I opened my eyes my mind went completely blank as I try to comprehend who, or perhaps, what I was looking at. </p><p>There gazing down at me was an ironclad pegasus, most of his body was covered in plates of metal fitted to his form. I could see what looked like chain vest under them which extended all the way down before disappearing around his hooves which was completely encased in armor. He wore a helmet similar to those used by the royal guards which had a slot in the back for his mane. The only thing that wasn’t protected were his oranged colored wing and light blue mane.  </p><p>All in all, the whole getup made the pony look like a horse straight out of medieval times. </p><p>But what really stood out was this massive bronze colored plate strapped on to one side covering nearly every bit of his body; which was now heavily scratched and dented with bits of green scales embedded into it. I could only wonder how fast the pony was falling when he smashed against the dragon’s head. Everything about him was very familiar yet his appearance made it difficult to recognize. </p><p>Until I saw a small mark etched into a piece of his armor in the middle of his chest; a foaming mug with wings. </p><p>“Bronze!?” I asked in disbelief. “That you?” </p><p>“Of course it’s me you idiot. Who else is crazy enough to pull a stunt like that?” He extended an armored hoof which I grabbed to help pull me up to my feet. </p><p>“The hell are you doing here? I thought-” I suddenly smelled alcohol. “Are you drunk!?”</p><p>“Naturally,” he answered as if it was something obvious. “And to your first question; I was helping with the evacuation when I saw this beauty hoofing at the opposite direction.” He gestured with his muzzle to point. </p><p>I pushed myself up to one arm before gazing at the direction he was pointing to see an earth pony about a block away galloping towards us, most likely a mare from the way Bronze described her. She wore a single strapped saddle bag which bounced on her side while her blonde colored mane flowed in the air against the wind. As she got closer I began to feel another familiar feeling from the pony, certain that I had met her somewhere before. </p><p>“Tried convincing her to group up with the rest but she just went all crazy and hysterical about finding you,” Bronze added. “Imagine my surprise when she said you were bucking it off with the dragon.” With a pained grunt I got back on my feet while clutching my side just as the mare skid to a stop in front of us. </p><p>&quot;Are you ok?! Oh my goodness you're bleeding!&quot; Without warning the mare lifted up my shirt with a hoof to look at my midsection. &quot;Oh dear Celestia....,&quot; she mumbled. Ignoring the fact she was trying to undress me, I looked down and saw nearly every part of was bruised showing signs of internal damage. Most were deep red but there plenty of blue and black splotches mainly around my sides where my chains was being pressed against my ribcage. </p><p>&quot;Rodney you need a doctor!&quot; she shouted. </p><p>I grabbed her hoof and pushed it away letting my shirt cover me again. &quot;I appreciate your concern er-ma'am, but-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ma'am?&quot; For a split second her noticed her expression turn hurtful. &quot;You don't remember me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hate to interrupt your little reunion,&quot; Bronze interrupted, &quot;but we got bigger problems right now!&quot; Following his gaze I saw the prone dragon had started to stir as he let out a low growl. </p><p>&quot;What about the reinforcements?!&quot; I asked hopefully. &quot;Are they here yet?!&quot;</p><p>&quot; 'Fraid not. But <i>somethings</i> going on in Canterlot, the entire castle lit up a while ago,&quot; he answered. “So far about half of the town have already evacuated, they’re boarding children and mares with child on the train but as for the rest-”</p><p>“Then I’m staying.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious!?” shouted the mare in disbelief. In truth I had a hard time believing my own words. But I did say it and what’s more I actually think I might have the balls to follow through with it.</p><p>“The best chance everyone has of surviving is to keep him here!” I argued as I pointed at the dragon. “If he chases-”</p><p>“Most won’t make it,” finished Bronze. “There’s no way anypony can outgallop a dragon. And with that fire of his us pegasi won’t get far either.”</p><p>“I’ll stay here and keep him distracted,” I continued as Falnor slowly pushed himself up. </p><p>“Hold on.” I felt a tinge of irritation at the thought of arguing further when I could be get in position or plan before Falnor could completely recover. </p><p>“There’s no time to-” I started just as she pulled the knot on the saddlebag with her mouth and flipped it open. She tucked her muzzle in and pulled out a box in between her teeth before gesturing for me to take it. </p><p>I’ve been through too much to care about hygiene at this point and grabbed the box out of her mouth without any hesitation. It was made out of wood with something metallic running through grooves on the surface forming a design the likes I’ve never seen before. But what was weird was the sensation of holding the box, or to be more accurate, the lack thereof. I could see the box in my hand but I couldn’t feel it, not the grooves of the wood or even the weight. It was like holding onto thin air. </p><p>I nearly dropped the box when I opened it as bright blue light suddenly bathed the entire area. Aside from sudden bright light I was also startled by what I ‘felt’. It was like opening a furnace or a barbecue pit where all the pent up heat suddenly gushed out at my face. </p><p>“How...” </p><p>“Twilight said you’d need it,” she explained. I took the gem out and relished in the ‘heat’ it gave off, it reminded me how scary powerful Twilight is. </p><p>“Yeah ok it’s pretty,” Bronze cut in again, “but how is that suppose to help us?” </p><p>“A lot,” I answered as my mind raced with new possibilities. One particular crazy idea stood out. “Bronze can you keep him off me?”</p><p>“Say what?”</p><p>“Can you!?” The ground shook as Falnor pushed himself up to his hind legs. </p><p>“Eh. Why not,” he replied with a nonchalant shrug.</p><p>“Make sure you keep him on the street! I need him to stay where he is!”</p><p>“No promises!” Bronze flexed his wings outwards before launching off the ground with a single powerful flap sending dust and pebbles in every direction. How he could fly while carrying so much weight is beyond me but at the moment I couldn’t give a damn. </p><p>“Command-line: Sentinel()!” The moment I shouted the key words the light of the gem dimmed considerably as fire wrapped around it. It jumped out of my hand and hovered in the air about two feet away from me. With a single thought I also siphoned a large amount of magic from the gem replenishing my  magic supply to the limit. </p><p>Strangely the pain from my body also seem to fade away, I could still feel it, but it was much more bearable than before. I couldn't be sure whether or not it had something to do with magic or it was simply the adrenaline flowing through my veins.</p><p>“Go hide somewhere before things get dangerous,” I ordered the mare. She looked at me with wide eyes and only took a single hesitant step back. “NOW!!”</p><p>With that she turned and bolted off back from where she came. When she did it was the first time I got a look at her mark; an ivory white plate with gold linings around the edge and a twinkle near the tip. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Isn’t that....’</span> Although I couldn’t quite remember her name, my right cheek suddenly itched as the memory surfaced. </p><p><i>‘What’s she doing in Ponyville?’</i> I quickly dismissed the thought and got back on task soon as I heard Bronze’s voice booming aloud. </p><p>“Well look who finally decided to wake up!” he taunted in the most snide and insulting tone possible. I watched him fly about circling the dragon spouting more insults. “What’s the matter big guy? Was that little bump on the head a bit too much Bronze for ya?”</p><p>Falnor clawed at the pegasus but he was still too groggy from the initial blow to the head to properly aim allowing Bronze to easily dodge. </p><p>“Ha! And you call yourself a dragon? I’ve seen iguanas bigger than you!!” </p><p>Convince that Bronze has the dragon’s attention I quickly got on maglev and made my way towards the nearest lamp post. I came only as close as I needed to cast a spell whilst injecting as much magic as the metal can hold, something I could never had done or as quickly without Twilight’s training. I made my way to the other side of the street and did the same to the opposite lamp post before moving towards the next pair. The entire frame went alight in blue fire like old dried up old trees being burned down. </p><p>I moved in a zigzag pattern from one lamp to another and getting further away from the dragon after each pair. Most of these lamp post are heavily damaged and bent from Falnor’s rampage but luckily none of them were ripped out of their foundation. With each post I ‘burned’ the entire street slowly started to transform into something eerily supernatural. </p><p>The sapphire’s glow had noticeably started to diminish as I constantly siphoned more magic out of it. But I could still feel the wealth of magic inside, even after the eighth lamp post I had barely even come close to using half of it all. If I hadn’t personally been part of its creation, I wouldn’t never have believed that all this magic came from a single pony. </p><p>Worried for Bronze, I looked back I caught a glimpse of him flying in between buildings where the dragon could not physically reach only to reappear somewhere off the side. From what I could see it looked like he was using the environment into his advantage to compensate for his heavy armor. So far it looks like he’s successful in distracting and keeping Falnor on the ground by being just barely in range. </p><p>“Oh no...,” I mumbled before slowing to a stop. I saw the yellowish glow radiating from the dragon’s belly. Bronze was currently flying high behind the dragon and I doubt he’d realize what was coming. </p><p>“HE”S GOING TO BREATHE!!” I screamed as loud as I could. </p><p>But it was too late. </p><p>Soon as I yelled Falnor opened his maw unleashing a torrential of flames at the pegasus. I expected him to either try flying out of range or hiding behind a building for cover. Instead he bellowed out a war cry and dove shield first right at the inferno disappearing into the flames. I waited for the longest second of my life before he finally resurfaced from the flames just before his shield collided squarely on the dragon’s snout. Like being punched I saw the head jerked back billowing fire for a short moment before it cut off as Falnor started to choke. </p><p>“That all you got!?” Bronze shouted with smoke rising off his body and shield glowing red hot. “I’ve FARTED things hotter than you!!!” </p><p>“Un...” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘...fucking...’</span> </p><p>“...believable.” I just stared wide eyed and slack jawed at the crazy, drunk pegasus. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Looks like he actually knows what he’s doing.’</span></p><p>“Right.” I kept an eye on him for another second before getting back on the task at hand. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘How much further?’</span> Except for a few pairs that were too close to the dragon, every lamp post on the street behind me was burning blue.</p><p>“I don’t know, far as we can?” I answered while dashing towards the next post. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Is this even gonna work?’</span></p><p>“God I hope so! I don’t know how long I can keep going.” Between all the gliding, running, throwing fireballs, and pretty much just everything that’s happened; being exhausted was a great understatement. </p><p>Eventually I arrived at the same location where I first encountered Falnor. The street and buildings were completely destroyed leaving behind massive piles of rubble. Remnants of what could have been a bookstore lay ruin in the middle of the street, its wall blocking any further progress. </p><p>“This is it then.” Soon as the last lamp post lit up I turned around and viewed my work. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/4410b76b7f63b71dba5e5a80643aeaecc1bd22b7?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.postimg.org%2F8y4nv4jar%2Fimage.jpg" /></p></div><p>Like something out of a cult movie the entire street was bathed in various shades of blue light, constantly shifting and changing as the fires engulfing every every lamp post danced about wildly.  </p><p>Blue fire engulfed a slab of rock, roughly the size of a beach ball, as it started to float from the ground and hovered in the air in front of me. I watched the dragon in the distance, about two blocks away still busy with Bronze. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Should we warn him?’</span></p><p>“Can’t that’ll tip the dragon off. I just have to make sure not to hit him.” With that I carefully align the lab of rock to float roughly in the middle of the street, a few meters away from the nearest pair of lamp post. </p><p>“Moment of truth.” I strained my eyes and watched as Bronze kept diving in and out of buildings evading Falnor’s wrath. I saw my chance when he suddenly veered off behind giving me a clear shot. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘NOW!!’</span> In a single thought I cast a magnet spell over the levitation. An opposite polarity to the magnet spells I casted on all the posts.</p><p>Nothing happened. </p><p>I couldn’t breathe. One second. Two second. Three second. </p><p>And still nothing. The slab of stone just hovered in front of me unmoving. Perhaps it really was too crazy an idea; trying to create a large scale maglev by use of multiple magnet spells. The theory was simple enough, the spell on each lamp post would pull and push anything with an opposite polarity. </p><p><i>‘Who am I kidding!? A railgun out of street lamps!?’</i> I felt a deep pit in my gut thinking that I might have risked Bronze’s life for nothing. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Try pushing it.’</span></p><p>What’s to lose? The fire on the slab intensified as I added a propulsion spell. With a small burst of flames the stone flew away in a straight line. </p><p>Only to suddenly veer off to the right and swerve back a split second later. It continued to weave left and right but never beyond the street accelerating exponentially as it moved from one pair of post to the next. Within seconds all I could see was the trail of blue light that spiralled about out of control.</p><p>“HA!” I shouted ecstatically. “Holy shit it worked!!”</p><p>I could hear it collide and break apart as it hit Falnor squarely on his right shoulder just before he tried to take another swipe at Bronze. Even from this distance I could see the dragon flinch and grasp his shoulder. It was proof enough that despite how small the stone was when compared to him, the speed and velocity in which it travelled made up the difference. </p><p>Turning his gaze Falnor finally noticed the bluish glow nearby, I could see his large slitted eyes follow the street and the burning posts until they finally fell on me. There was about a second as he took in the view before I heard a low growling sound from him. Even from this distance I could see the glint of his fangs as he sneered and laughed at the spectacle. </p><p>“Shit, he knows!” With the way the burning lamp posts were lined up, even a child would have been able to deduce that I could only shoot in one direction. All he had to do was get out of the street to escape. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Then start shooting!!’</span></p><p>To have more control, I shot my arms out to the side as a multitude of rubble and furniture was suddenly engulfed in blue flames before floating up to the air. I started casting the magnet and propulsion spell on the largest object - a piece of stone wall roughly half my height and just as wide - and launched it as quick as possible without screwing up. </p><p>Just as it started to pick up speed I finished prepping the next ammo - a long broken piece of timber - and launched before moving to the next, and the one after, and so on. I kept siphoning what magic I had used up from the sapphire still floating near me which was slowly starting to dim every time I threw something. I saw them wiz and spiral in wild arcs seemingly out of control yet remaining within the street as they fly. </p><p>Before Falnor could even take a step the first of many projectiles started hitting and exploding on impact. At the time I could only guess that the remaining magic on those objects must have been released as they break, causing the explosions.</p><p>I wasn’t entirely sure if everything I threw scored a hit, all I could do at the moment was just focus on the task and kept launching one shot after another. It didn’t matter if the things I picked up were broken sofas or a small kitchen knife. My mind had fallen into the moment completely focused on the mad rush as I kept launching everything I could see in abandoned. The ruined buildings around me offered plenty of ammunition and I launched everything piece of debris that I could. Even the toilet seat. </p><p>Falnor let out a series of pained roars as he brought his head down close to his body so that he could protect it with his thick arms. I saw a few smaller projectiles flying past the dragon’s body only to puncture through his leathery wings inciting more cries of pain. Those cries were my only indication of progress, for every second I kept him here it means more time for the reinforcements to arrive or at least give everyone as much time to evacuate as possible. </p><p><i>‘Why am I doing this? This is not my world. They’re not even human. I shouldn’t be doing this!’</i> These thoughts and questions started echoing in the back of my mind. <i>‘I’m a programmer for Christ’s sake! This isn’t me!’</i> And every single time I remembered back to those eyes. </p><p>Sweetie Belle’s eyes. I can’t explain it perfectly, they way she just looked up at me as she hugged my leg, it was a look I didn’t want to disappoint or fail. The idea that anything or anyone would harm something so innocent and fragile as that cheerful, energetic and clumsily destructive white filly made me realize something. </p><p>Where bravery fights fear. Rage kills it completely.</p><p>“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!” I didn’t realize that I was screaming till I finally gasped for breath, and even then I continued to scream even louder. I didn’t realize that I was starting to launch multiple projectiles at once from two, to three, to four till they started colliding midflight. </p><p>Despite all the explosions and dust covering the dragon, I could see the glow of his yellow eyes as he too was staring at me. Time seem to stop as we glared at each other, and for the first time I felt no fear under his gaze. Instead I felt a great urge to just rush at him and do everything in my power to cause him harm.</p><p>In reply Falnor bellowed against the onslaught, a roar that dwarfed all others that I could actually feel it hitting my chest. I fell to my knees covering my ears trying my best to block out the sound which kept on going for a while before it finally started to die down. When I looked up I saw a both wings spread out wide as Falnor readied himself to take flight. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘His gonna fly!!’</span> </p><p>“No shit!” I jumped back up and quickly continued the barrage but it was too late. His roar had bought him enough reprieve from the onslaught to safely escape. </p><p>With each flap Falnor slowly rose to the air as dust clouds started building up around him, even from where I stood I could feel the air blowing past. Most of the projectiles flew harmlessly under while a few lucky ones struck the dragon, but it wasn’t enough to bring him down. But just before he could rise above the buildings I caught a glimpse of yellow flash in the sky as Bronze dove from high above in a similar fashion as before. </p><p>Even from this distance I could hear the sickening CRACK as Bronze collided with the dragon’s right wing shattering bone before bouncing off to the side. With a deep yet high pitched yelp the dragon fell to the ground right back to the street becoming a target once again. I stared at the pegasus as he shook his head in a dizzy manner before he turned and looked at me from afar. </p><p>“Wait are you waiting for!?” he shouted. “Wail on him!!” With that reminder I turned my attention back to the dragon continued on the assault. </p><p>As the first wave struck Falnor’s prone body I began to wonder what I hoped to achieve with this plan. Sure I was buying time for the townsfolk to get away, but then what? There’s no way I can keep this up till everyone safely reaches Canterlot. The most I could do was leave the dragon bruised and battered but despite the damage it won’t keep him down. </p><p><i>‘What I need is-’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘An end game idea.’</span> I started brainstorming even as I continue the bombardment which seem to be making it really difficult for the dragon to rise from his prone position. </p><p><i>‘We don’t have enough magic for a brand new plan. Gonna have to use what we got right now.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Shoot something sharp maybe? Like an arrow?’</span></p><p><i>‘That’ll only work if I can control how it flies or aim properly.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Then just throw something heavy! You’ve been hitting with light jabs, it’s time for the right hook!’</span> I looked around but the only thing I could see were broken things. </p><p><i>‘There’s nothing here big enough for that!’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You sure? What’s the heaviest thing we’ve ever lifted?’</span></p><p>“Oh for crying-can’t you just tell me!?” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘What’s on the top right of your vision right now?’</span> </p><p>The floating sapphire, still burning blue. </p><p>“How is that....” My voice drifted off as a memory resurfaced in my mind, a very painful one. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Bingo.’</span> It’s possible, with the remaining magic in the sapphire it was possible. </p><p>I looked around the side of the streets for the largest intact building I could find. Most were half destroyed by the dragon but one still stood tall and firm to my right. It was a three story building and was entirely untouched, it even had a banner that draped across the front entrance. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">GRAND RE-OPENING!</span></p></div><p>It took a moment for me to recognize the store, but with all the sweets laid out behind the window and the three-candy-wrapped sign hanging out front; it was undoubtedly Bonbon’s candy store. The very same one where the Crusaders wrecked some time ago. </p><p>“She’s gonna kill me.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Beggars can’t be choosers. Do it!’</span></p><p>I fired what remaining rubble I had picked up before turning to pay my full attention at the building. Hopefully that broken wing would make it difficult for the dragon to pick himself up, giving me enough time for one last crazy idea. </p><p>I stared at the shop for a moment trying to wrap my mind on how I should go about accomplishing such a task. By all reason it should be possible, despite all the magic I’ve siphoned from the sapphire it still had more magic than Rarity’s fire ruby. Still that incident was a spur of the moment, to consciously attempt something like that....</p><p>“Here goes nothing.” Looking at the shop, I picture it’s size in my mind, wrapping around it like a gelatinous liquid as I started channeling magic into the levitation spell. Imagine trying to wrap a present with your mind while being blindfolded and you only have a rough idea what the present is. As if that wasn’t hard enough the amount of magic required was staggering, even before the spell managed to wrap around the building I had already used about half of my entire reserve. </p><p>For the first time I had to both mentally juggle between casting a spell and siphoning magic at the same time, like trying to memorize several different phone numbers simultaneously. By some miracle I managed to stay focused on the task as blue fire continue to spread around the building like wild vines. </p><p>“What in Celestia’s-shiny-flank are you doing!?” shouted Bronze in the distance. </p><p>“Give! Me! Time!” I yelled trying my best not to lose concentration. He mumbled what sounded like curses followed by a warcry before I started to hear loud metallic clanging in the distance accompanied by the dragon’s roaring. </p><p>I was greatly tempted to take a peek at the scene but chose against it fearing it would break interrupt the spell. I could only imagine the grim outcome should I lose focus causing the spell to break especially with all the magic I’ve invested, it would likely be my last mistake. </p><p>Eventually the flames did spread as the spell finally wrapped itself over the building. I could hear a loud deep rumble from the shop as I began to lift the structure from its foundation along a racket from inside as furniture and various items fell from their place. </p><p>Windows shattered as their frames bend while roof tiles rained down from above as I supercharged the spell with even more magic. The building jerked several times as pipes and foundations were forcefully ripped apart setting the shop free. With every second that passed by the sapphire continued to dim at a considerable rate, not wasting anymore time I pulled the structure out to the street. I was so focused on controlling the spell that I nearly forgot to move out of the way as it slowly glided towards me. </p><p>I had both hands stretched out in front of me using bodily movement to help guide and control the spell. Roof tiles, broken glass, furniture and hundreds of candies fell out the windows as I began tilting the shop on its side. I feared the plan might not work if I threw something so tall, at the least it would mean pointing the sharp end of the building at the dragon. </p><p>The structure hovered about a meter of the ground as I positioned it in the center of the street with the roof aimed forward before I was ready to move on. Once in position I immediately replaced the levitation spell with an extremely overcharged maglev spell which allowed it to hover on its own. With my mind less strained I began casting the propulsion spell, one powerful enough to give it the required velocity to get it going. </p><p>Though I knew I had to focus on the task the ruckus in the distance pulled my attention. I didn’t know how he did it but Bronze somehow managed to keep Falnor from properly getting back up and on the street all this time. However, it was clear that he was far less agile as before which probably meant he was running out of stamina.</p><p>Meaning I don’t have much time left. </p><p>There was no knowing how much magic I’d need to push something as large as the shop, but with the risk of Bronze getting hit or worse, I have to gamble with what I have now. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Launch it!!’</span></p><p>“Hang on!” I stuck my thumb and index finger to my mouth and blew the loudest whistle I could muster hoping to inform Bronze and get him away from the dragon. The high pitched tone easily traveled across the distance attracting Bronze’s attention as he turned to look at my direction. Despite the distance I could make out how his eyes widened at the sight. </p><p>Unfortunately that momentary distraction cost him dearly, I saw the massive green tail coming yet before I could even yell out a warning it struck Bronze clean on the side. I saw him fly from the impact colliding into one of the houses to the left side in an explosion of dust and stone. </p><p>“BRONZE!!” It was too fast to tell if he was struck by the spikes on the tail but even if he lucked out the sheer impact alone could easily kill him. I could only hope his armor kept him alive. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We can’t do anything for him! Fire the damn thing!’</span> </p><p>In essence, the propulsion spell works by replicating gunpowder and simply propelling something using directed force. So I shouldn’t be surprised when I saw a funnel of blue flames explode outwards like a rocket from the building’s end. The sheer blast of wind from the explosion was strong enough to blow me off my feet throwing me hard on my back. I was left somewhat stunned and dizzy for about a second before I managed to roll over and pull my head back up. </p><p>Dread grip my guts when I saw the building sluggishly gliding over the ground despite the amount of force from the spell. I pounded my fist at the ground, angered that I fail to take into account something as obvious as the weight of the building. There was simply not enough magnetic force on the lamp posts to move something with such weight. It was definitely working though, the structure was picking up speed over time but at a snails pace. </p><p>It will not reach any significant velocity to do much damage to the dragon, if it even reaches him in time before he get’s out of the way. </p><p>“Shit this isn’t gonna work!” There was no time to restrategize or come up with an alternative, at such a critical moment the simplest solution is often the best. </p><p>My body screamed for me to just relent and rest as I got up which I ignored as much as I could before getting back on maglev to catch up with the flying candy shop. I’m not sure what Bronze did to Falnor, but despite seeing what’s coming the dragon had a lot of trouble getting up on his claws. Even getting on all four seem to be causing him a lot of pain, likely more broken bones from the way a few fingers seem to be bent. </p><p>As soon as I got close enough to the building I immediately cast a less powerful version of the propulsion spell in a similar fashion as before. It created a smaller and shorter burst of blue flames which accelerated the building a bit. I quickly veered to the side of the street away from the direction of the blast before casting casting another one followed by another. </p><p>With every burst the building kept picking up speed which increased further on as the magnetic force on the lamp post added their share of the effort. Eventually I had to push myself faster to keep up as I closed in on the target. But despite my efforts and how fast I was closing in I knew it was impossible to achieve the same speed as all the smaller projectiles I fired before. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We’re getting too close! Time to bail!’</span> By now the dragon had managed to get back on all four and was trying his best to get out of the way, even attempting to plow through the buildings nearby. But he was too slow, his size was a weapon but now it acted against him. </p><p>“A bit more!!” I quickly collected as much magic as I could, fuelling to one last burst of speed before finally terminating the maglev and skidding to a halt. I watched with bated breath as the building travelled on at about forty-five miles per hour, nothing close to what I wanted but I hoped that size and mass alone would make up for the lack of speed. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Don’t forget the last bit.’</span> </p><p><i>‘Ah right, the explo-’</i> </p><p>“OH SHIT!!” How stupid could I get? I saw how those smaller projectiles exploded on impact when the spell broke releasing all the remaining magic. I could only imagine the scale of destruction when all the magic holding that three story building afloat is released as raw magic. </p><p>My raw magic. </p><p>With a roar I saw Falnor rise up to stand on his hind legs ready to brace against the inevitable collision completely oblivious to what’s coming. Much as I wanted to witness the outcome I knew I was risking my life needlessly by staying out in the open, with the threat of death urging me one I quickly made my way and dove right into the nearest alley with the sapphire following behind. I landed on my belly and remained on the prone position wrapping my hands over my head and waited. </p><p>There was a brief moment where everything in the world fell silent until...</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/18e3f3b5027228805e14a77697c2e7e191a1de2c?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs20.postimg.org%2F4s0tcaj0d%2FBlue_Atomic.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN: No it didn’t go nuclear. Picture is slightly exaggerated.]</p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/f55d9cade2e809373f117664dbca0829877217dc?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs20.postimg.org%2F5zln74b7h%2Fimage.png" /></p></div><p>For what felt like minutes I heard nothing but the sound of the explosion drowning out everything in the world. I felt the ground gave a sudden shake as gale like winds blew through the alley carrying dust, trash and debris until it blinded me like a thick mist. I felt something small and heavy rain down all over me for some time which came to a sudden stop when the noise finally started to ebb away. </p><p>I waited until the noise died out completely before slowly lifting my head. A heavy layer of dust still lingered in the air making it difficult to breath properly. All around me were shattered pieces of glass and roof tiles, considering how thick and heavy they were it was a miracle that I wasn’t hurt at all. </p><p>I slowly pushed myself up while being careful to avoid sharp glass when I heard something shatter just above my head. More broken roof tiles rained down for a moment before everything went silent again. Looking up I saw the sapphire hovering above my head right where I heard the tile break. </p><p><i>‘Not a miracle then.’</i> The gem must’ve protected me during the explosion. </p><p>I suddenly realized how dark and eerily quiet everything was. There was absolutely nothing to be heard other than my own heavy breathing and the jingle of my chains. All the lights and even the lamp posts burning with my magic was extinguished, I’d probably be blind in the dark without the sapphire illuminating the area. I grabbed a part of my shirt and covered my mouth to help filter out the dust in the air before turning around and slowly making my way to the end of the alley. </p><p>Although I could make out things in close proximity it was difficult to see further through the dark, and almost impossible to see anything beyond a few meters. The glow from the sapphire, though dim, offered suitable light to for me to navigate. But it was too risky, if Falnor was still around he’d see me clear though the dark. </p><p>“Command-line: Terminate(),” I whispered to the gem. The fire disappeared and I grabbed it out of the air just before it started to fall. </p><p>Unlike before where the sapphire shined bright as a light bulb, it now glowed dimly with a blue fire burning inside just like Rarity’s fire ruby though much larger. Thankfully the magic inside was of mine so I don’t have to worry about accidentally draining it unless I wanted to. I tucked it inside my jacket before making my way roughly to where I last saw the dragon. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Do you really have to?’</span></p><p><i>‘I have to know if it worked.’</i> Common sense demanded that I keep my distance and wait, but then again nothing so far made any sense either. </p><p>I nearly jumped out of fright when I ‘felt’ something in front of me. It was all over the ground and I could ‘feel’ the heat of magic radiating from it while it glowed in my ‘Sight’. It was hard to tell from the darkness but if I had to guess it was some sort of liquid, and there was only one kind of liquid I know that contained magic.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Is that...’</span></p><p><i>‘Blood. His blood. All of it.’</i> The closer I got the more I discover how much blood there was, from the way it spread out it must’ve covered the entire width of the street. </p><p><i>‘He’s definitely hurt, that’s for sure.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘But we don’t know if he’s down or if he’s just pissed off.’</span> The idea of him not only surviving a blast like that but still able to fight was frightening. </p><p>I carefully inched closer to the pool of blood before taking a single careful step on it. I expected to feel a surge of magic crawl up my leg but after a few seconds of nothing happening I concluded that my shoes were acting as a barrier. I was tempted to drain the magic from the blood for my own use and inject the excess magic to the sapphire in case there was too much of it. </p><p>I had crouched and was just about to touch the blood with my hand when I heard shifting stone somewhere to my left. I froze in position not daring to move and waited, eyes strained for any movement in the dark. </p><p>“Uuuugh....” It took a few seconds for me to realize what I was hearing, it was barely above a whisper but I still recognize the voice. </p><p>“Bronze?” I called out in a controlled volume. Much as I would have liked shout the name there was simply too much of the situation I didn’t know. The dragon could be unconscious and my voice could accidentally wake him up. </p><p>“Uhh, monkey?” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Yup, definitely him.’</span></p><p>“Bronze you ok? Where are you?”</p><p>“I...uhh I don’t know.” I quickly made my way through the blood, splashing it about as I go while trying to follow his voice. </p><p>“Keep talking but not too loud, I’ll come and find you.”</p><p>“Wha-what happened? I can’t remember much. Feels like somepony bucked my skull.” he asked in a weak and strained voice. I could tell he was hurting. </p><p>“Yeah sorry about that, kinda my fault,” I answered just as I come across a half destroyed building. It was likely the same one that Bronze was thrown to earlier, probably helped protect him from the explosion. I climbed into the building through a large opening on the wall and carefully walked deeper inside. With half of the building gone it allowed the moon to shine down offering me some light, plus my eyes have adjusted to the dark so it was easy navigating through all the rubble and broken furniture. </p><p>“The dragon? What happened to...” </p><p>“Don’t know, haven’t seen him yet.” Eventually my ‘Sight’ located Bronze in in front of me, his ‘fire’ was extremely small yet it burned strong. Hopefully that meant he didn’t suffer any life threatening injuries. </p><p>“How ugh, in blazes do you lose sight of something that big?” I spotted Bronze’s large shield laying on the side of a small pile of rubble. Seeing as the ‘fire’ was right under it all, it was safe to assume Bronze was completely buried inside. </p><p>“I didn’t lose sight of him, it’s too dark to see anything,” I answered as I began removing rubble with my hands. Eventually I found one of his hind legs and worked around it until I uncovered his head and most of his body. Slowly he turned his head around to look up at me.</p><p>“Oh, I thought my eyes were closed.” He was lying sideways and there were fallen feathers around, even in the darkness I could tell one of his wings was bent awkwardly where it’s not supposed to. Aside from the broken wing however it didn’t look like he suffered much, he really did lucked out not being impaled by all those spikes. </p><p>Rubble started falling to the side as Bronze pushed himself up to all fours, I quickly used my hands to keep him from falling over. </p><p>“Should you be moving?” I asked worriedly. </p><p>“Nothing a good drink won’t solve,” he answered. “You’re gonna have to carry my shield.” I turned to look at the large dented piece of metal. </p><p>“Do I have to? We can pick it up later.”</p><p>“We ain’t leaving it, that shield saved your flank as it did mi-” his voice cut off when I suddenly clasp my hand over his mouth. </p><p>“I heard something,” I mouthed silently. </p><p>Both of us stood frozen in place in silence, I could see Bronze’s ear swerving around trying to catch the slightest sound. Then I heard it again, from somewhere outside I heard the sound of loose stone and rubble shuffling and moving. Silently I turned around to look out the collapse wall to see an enormous mound of rubble out in the street, it could easily be labelled as a small hill. </p><p>Slowly it rose and grew into a dark shadow, rising up and up until it blocked out the moonlight. Rubble started falling off revealing hundreds of green scales before a large wing flexed out throwing rock and debris to every direction. </p><p>Both Bronze and I could only watch in absolute silence and horror as Falnor rose from the ashes. While most of his back remain as it was, almost every scale on his front and especially around the belly was either gone or pitch black. A mass of burnt muscle and skin was all the remain with blood bleeding profusely like a fountain coloring the street deep red. </p><p>Suddenly the dragon took in a long deep breath which stretched his wounded chest outward causing blood to squirt out. I saw him grit his fangs together in pain before noticing a glow emanating from his belly and for a moment I thought he knew where we were and was about to burn us alive. </p><p>Before I could make a move however, Falnor simply let out a long sigh as something that looked like red mist poured out of his mouth. It continued to pour out like heavy smoke, drifting down and covering his body before it all suddenly moved with purpose. It swirled and concentrated around his chest seeming to cause discomfort as he let out a series of low painful grunts. The red mist was too thick to see past but occasionally it would thin out in certain areas just enough for me to catch a glimpse. I couldn’t be sure but I swear the mass of pink muscles started to turn into a darker color with each passing second like something was wrapping over the wound. </p><p><i>‘Oh my god. It’s-’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘-healing him.’</span></p><p>Without warning the red mist suddenly started coiling away like a snake to other parts of the dragon’s body. The massive open wound on his front had been replaced with a dark red layer of thick scab like skin, what would have taken weeks or months had been accomplished in a matter of seconds. Even the heavy flow of blood had ceased with only a few trickle here and there, a minor scratch when compared to the size of his body. </p><p>Then the mist started to wrap itself around the dragon’s broken wing which suddenly have a loud CRACK as the bones were forcefully realign causing Falnor to roar out in pain. I saw with my own eyes as the holes in his leather wings started to closing in leaving only a few insignificantly small ones to heal naturally. </p><p>In roughly a minute Falnor undid what Bronze and I risked our lives to accomplish. </p><p>I watched in horror as Falnor started moving his body, flexing his claws and wings as he examined the results of what could only be the work of magic. Something tugged my back pulling my attention momentarily away from the dragon as I turned around. </p><p>Bronze looked at me in the eye and silently mouthed the words, “We need to hide!” His good wing was pointing towards a room about four meters away completely dark and secluded. </p><p>I gave him a nod before carefully grasping my chains in each hand hoping I could keep it from making any noise and betraying out position. Bronze had it tough, much as he tried it was impossible to move without making some noise while wearing his armor. </p><p>With our eyes focused on the dragon Bronze and I ever so slowly crept inch by inch all the while hoping desperately we would remain unnoticed. Despite the occasional soft clinking from Bronze’s armor the dragon appear to remain oblivious, it actually looked like we’ll make it. But just as we were about to reach the room.....</p><p><b>“Like I said before.”</b> We both froze in place and watched as Falnor slowly turned his head to us. His large yellow eyes looked directly at mine as he bared his fangs with a low growl. He positioned his large green claw around the building, almost hugging it and eliminating any chance for use to escape. With the wall behind and Falnor covering the large opening with his massive body, it was clear that we were completely trapped. </p><p><b>“I can smell you.”</b></p><p>I shot a glance to the right then the left, trying desperately to figure out a way out of this situation. I thought about blowing a hole in the wall and escaping that way but I couldn’t risk it. From what I’d seen Falnor could be deceptively quick despite his size, especially his long neck. Like a serpent he could easily bite me clean in half the moment I attempted anything. </p><p>I stared at Bronze hoping for some kind of signal to a plan but he merely shook his head at me. If his wing weren’t broken there might be a chance that at least one of us can make it but....</p><p><b>“I suppose you’ve earn some praise for you efforts,”</b> Falnor continued. <b>“Only a fellow dragon has ever harmed me to such an extent.”</b></p><p>The sapphire was still in my pocket, it still had magic left that I could use but no matter how much I tried I couldn’t come up with anything. I thought about using up all the magic I had left in one massive fireball but something like that exploding so close would mean suicide. There was simply no way that I could see myself surviving this predicament. </p><p>Before I could think up any other ideas everything started to brighten slightly as Falnor’s belly started to glow again. </p><p><b>“But this is as far as you go Kindling.”</b> </p><p>There was a sudden brightness that illuminated everything around us as Falnor unleashed the inferno. I saw the fire roaring towards us and all I could do was watch with my hands held out in a pitiful attempt to protect myself. As the temperature around me sky rocket I could feel the air itself blistering my skin with intense heat as the edges of my hair started to singed.</p><p>And then it was gone. </p><p>The intense heat disappeared just as everything around me turned dark. I thought for a moment that the fire must’ve seared off the nerves on my skin along with my eyes, but I could still feel myself blinking and feel my clothes on my body. Then I realized that I could still hear the roaring sound of the fire burning all around and the crackling of burning wood. </p><p>“The heck is this!?” I heard Bronze ask confused. I turn around and sure enough he was there next to me. </p><p>“I don’t-” before I could finish the bellowing noise of the fire ebbed away. Soon the darkness thinned away and evaporated revealing nothing but destruction all around. Everything was covered in black soot, what was one furniture and household items were now grey ash that linger in the air. Metal beams within the walls were still glowing red hot while the stone floor now acted as frying pan, I could already smell of burning plastic from my shoes and the air still . Everything was black like charcoal while almost every furniture and object not made of stone or steel had burned to ash. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“WHO DARES BRING HARM TO OUR SUBJECTS!! WE WILL HAVE THY NAME DRAKE!!”</span> All of us, including the dragon, turned towards the voice. </p><p>There, across the street standing on a roof was Luna. At least I think that’s her, though it’s been a long time since I last saw her, never have I seen her like this. Her eyes were glowing pure ivory white while her mane flowed upwards as if she was falling and her wings stretched out to the side. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/65923b254d599a0f58e50e5e4838d500378651d3?url=http%3A%2F%2Fth09.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2FPRE%2Ff%2F2012%2F128%2Fb%2Ff%2Fprincess_luna_by_millatea-d4yy61e.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN: Not exactly what I want but good enough.]</p></div><p>What took my attention most was her horn, it was shining in bright cobalt blue, bright enough to illuminated the entire street outside. It was packing so much magic that I could ‘Sense’ it from all the way here in waves, almost like having steam blown at me. </p><p><i>‘Wait, is she the reinforcements?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘It’s about fucking time!!’</span></p><p>The air thicken as Luna and Falnor stared each other down, both unwilling to flinch or relent under the gaze of the other. </p><p><b>“You will not take her!!”</b> roared Falnor as he unleashing a torrent of flames. She disappeared behind a veil of fire, it didn’t look like she had created anything to protect herself. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“WRETCHED!!”</span> A solid beam of white light, at least three meters in diameter suddenly struck the dragon on his back. Green scales and blood gushed out as Falnor roared in pain and falling down to all four. </p><p>I looked towards the voice to see Luna hovering in the sky completely unharmed and looking absolutely pissed. </p><p>“How the hell did she get there?” I mumbled in awe. As the words left my lips Luna’ bright eyes turned on me. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“LEAVE THIS PLACE!!”</span> she commanded with an air of absolute superiority. </p><p>“I think we better listen!” Bronze was commented which I wholeheartedly agree. With the brief exchange I could tell the scale of the battle would be massive. We could easily get caught in the crossfire if we’re not careful. The plan was simple; get back to the street and get as far away as possible, as fast as possible. I tried my best to support Bronze as we make our way towards the farthest opening in the wall, away from the battle engagement when the pegasus suddenly halted to a stop. </p><p>“Wait wait! My shield!” he shouted while pointing at the metal plate with a hoof. </p><p>“Seriously!?” I asked in disbelief. I reached out with my mind and cast a levitation spell on the shield engulfing it in blue fire as it began to rise and hover. “Alright let’s get the hell out of here!” Soon as the words left my lips I saw the dragon had picked himself up and was glaring up at Luna. With a roar he leapt upwards at her with a mighty beat of his wings. </p><p>“Now’s our chance! C’mon!” While the battle took to the skies Bronze and I used this chance to run and jump out of the building back out into the street. Splashing through a pool of dragon blood and simply ran deeper into town, all the while hearing the occasional roars and sounds of magic in the sky above. </p><p>I looked around the trying to find any sign of royal guards anywhere, but after awhile I concluded that Luna had come alone. She may be one of the ruling heads in Equestria, but unlike Celestia I’ve never personally ‘Sensed’ how powerful she was. Though it’s almost guaranteed that she’s more powerful than me, I’m not sure it’s wise leaving her to fend for herself. </p><p>“You really think it’s ok leaving her alone?” I asked worried. “What if she-”</p><p>Without warning Bronze suddenly leaped at me, throwing me to the side before landing face down with Bronze pressing down on me. Before I could question his sudden hostility the ground shook violently Falnor crashed into the ground only a few meters in front of us. Dust and rubble flew everywhere while I stared at the sight, if we had continued running for a few more seconds it we would have been crushed. </p><p>“Does that answer your question?” Bronze answered. </p><p>Gashes and cuts covered nearly every part of Falnor’s body, most were around his back and bleeding heavily. The most severe wound was on probably his left wing, all the leathery webbing was almost completely shredded off leaving only a few tattered bits to hanging. Probably the reason he fell back to earth. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“ARROGANT FOOL!! THOU’ST BELIEVE TO BEST US IN COMBAT?!”</span> Looking up I saw Luna descend from the sky with her horn still radiating like a beacon. Her mane and tail was writhing about like black fire mirroring her rage. </p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">“DESIST AT ONCE!!”</span> Despite how one sided the battle was Falnor merely growled at her as he slowly pushed himself back up. </p><p>Out of nowhere I suddenly felt a pressure pushing me to the ground, at first I thought Bronze was pressing down on me but he too lay on his belly next to me as surprised as I was. Though it was still bearable the ground in front of us suddenly fell a few feet as Falnor was struck back to the ground by an invisible force. I could almost see the air in front of me stir like I was seeing through an unfocused lense, rocks were being crushed to bits while lamp posts were flatten to the ground. </p><p>From the looks of it Falnor was suffering against a much greater force, while I could just barely push myself up, he remained still despite how much he seem to struggle. All around I heard the constant sound of stone being grinded to dust, metal support from a nearby building creaked as they collapse to the ground. </p><p>“The...hell is...going on!?” even talking was taking a lot of effort. </p><p>“Don’t...ask...me!” shouted Bronze as he too struggled to get up. </p><p>With my head to the side my eyes gazed upwards to see Luna now standing on the roof of a building as the light of her horn intensified. The brighter it grew the more heavy my body felt and within a few seconds I was forced to rest my head against the ground with my body completely flat. </p><p>From what I could gather, the only possible explanation was that she’s somehow manipulating the gravity around us. It’s the only one that made sensed considering how everything is being crushed and not just Falnor. Likely Bronze and I got too close to the actual focus point of the spell and merely suffering a diminished effect. Diminished or not, the pressure was starting to become unbearable and difficult to breath. </p><p>“Luna!” I shouted, hoping to get her attention. Likely she wasn’t aware we were in the vicinity and thought we had ran off. “Lu-ugh! We’re right here!” Either she couldn’t hear us or was too preoccupied with the dragon to notice my voice. </p><p>I then realize a slight glow in the corner of my eye. Pulling my head slightly back a bit I saw the sapphire lying on the ground several feet away from me. </p><p>With a large crack in the middle.</p><p>I started to panic as I imagined the implications. What will happen to the magic inside? Will it be released? The magic in the stuff I threw at the dragon exploded when they broke didn’t it? </p><p>“LUNA!!” I shouted atop my lungs. “LUNA STOP!!” But she didn’t relent, not even after the sound of Falnor’s shattered bones echoed around or when his chest stopped rising. </p><p>Another crack appeared on the side which started growing bit by bit like a root. The magic inside was a shadow of what it had in the beginning, yet it was still so much more than I can handle. At least twice as much. </p><p>“What’s going on over there?” Bronze asked, he must’ve noticed the sudden panic in my voice.</p><p><i>‘Dammit he’s here too!’</i> After all that the I’ve done, all I’ve survived battling the dragon; I was gonna die from my own creation. Worse the blast would kill Bronze as well, we’re still just acquaintances but he was willing to risk his life for me. Multiple times even. </p><p>My mind raced as I try to plan out something to get us both out of this, or at the least, him. I could just siphon parts of it and use it before siphoning more, thereby depleting it completely. But before I could the gem finally cracked under the pressure, splitting right down the middle in half. </p><p>I didn’t hesitate.</p><p>I reached out and touched the magic with my mind siphoning it all in me. For just a split second I could see something like a translucent white cotton ooze out of the gem before it surge right at my face. I could feel the magic well up inside me and for the briefest moment I held more magic than I’ve ever had before. </p><p>And like a promise, the pain came.</p><p>I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t even scream as hot white pain surged through my mind like it was being poked with a red hot iron bar. The pain was constant and absolute, blocking out all my other senses. I couldn’t hear, feel, smell or see anything, the world had been replaced by pure unrelenting agony. Time became nonexistent, it could have been a mere second or a minute since the pain started. </p><p>But as frightening as it was, it was nothing compared to what I....felt? Heard? It was hard to describe but something broke in my mind. Because after that, it all disappeared. </p><p>What scared me most was the absolute nothingness, not merely darkness of sight but in the mind as well. Voices, I remember hearing voices but it was so far away, the world was so far away. I could still create some form of thought but it was quickly slipping away becoming harder and harder to think and eventually....</p><br/><br/><p>It swallowed me completely.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 33 - I’m home<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock</p><p>AN: Please read the author's note at the bottom. </p><hr/><p>“C’mon. C’mon!” shouted the grey stallion in frustration. “Give me something!!” A cone of light shined from his ghostly white horn scouring the ground like a searchlight wherever he looked. “Nothing! No physical evidence, no magical trace, it’s like this thing didn’t exist!” Inquest turned to look at his avian partner, “Did you really see a dragonchild?”</p><p>“Like I said before, I <i>thought</i> I saw one,” the gryphon answered without taking her eyes off the cavern tunnel. “I was too busy flying for my life to get a good look. You really think it’s ok for us to be here?”</p><p>After their confrontation with Falnor, Crea had taken the drained unicorn a good distance away to rest. She had taken him up to a higher elevation in the trees which was inaccessible to nearly all predatory animals in the Everfree, not that it mattered. Luckily the gryphon’s guess was spot on, the dragon’s residence had created a void of animal life around his territory. She saw nothing but the critters of the forest all night.</p><p>Despite how hard she argued, Inquest’s stubbornness was made of harder stuff. When he awoke and learned of the dragon’s sudden departure, he insisted on returning back to the cave in search of this “daughter”. But by the time they returned to the cavern it was all but deserted, even with Crea’s trained eye they could not spot any sign of the black dragon’s presence.</p><p>If it was even a dragon; she still wasn’t quite sure what she saw. But it was undeniable that <i>something</i> was there, they had both heard the voice.</p><p>“I still think we should’ve followed that dragon,” spoke Crea as she continued to keep an eye on the cavern entrance for danger. “They flew off like that....and that roar. You know as well as I do what that was.”</p><p>“He was on a warpath,” Inquest answered casually as he continue to scour the ground. “From what you told me, I’d reckon he’s headed for Ponyville; a small town on the outskirts of the forest.”</p><p>“You knew?” she asked as she finally turned her attention to the grey pony. “Then shouldn’t we-”</p><p>“No. This takes priority.”</p><p>“How does <i>this</i> take priority over saving a town from a dragon attack!?” she shouted. Her voice echoed throughout the cavern and was likely carried outside for anyone and anything to hear. But at the moment she didn’t care.</p><p>“We’re talking about lives here! Ponies we could save! We’ve dealt with dragons before, several of them at once!”</p><p>Inquest let out a sigh. “First of all; we <i>ran</i> from several dragons at once. We never fought them,” he replied in a casual tone.</p><p>“You know what I-”</p><p>“Second,” he cut in, “this <i>is</i> more important than helping them.” Crea just gave him a angered look and waited for him to continue.</p><p>“Think about it, it’s a fact that Falnor, that dragon, had no child when he moved to Equestria. And even if he somehow bore a child with another dragon behind Equestria law, that child would be in the care of the mother. Not the father.” The glow around Inquest’s horn died down as he turned and trotted towards the gryphon.</p><p>“So whatever it is you saw, whoever that voice belonged to, it could not have been his daughter. Based on your own description this....thing might not even be a dragon. But you saw how Falnor looked when it suddenly spoke. His demeanor completely changed and he fully believes he has a daughter.” Despite her anger, Crea was slowly starting to follow the unicorn’s line of thinking and reasoning.</p><p>“There are a lot of ways to manipulate the mind, I can think of five right from the top of my head. The who or what that manipulated Falnor isn’t important. The real problem is that a dragon is the one being controlled. This thing can pull the strings on a dragon; a fully grown, mature dragon like a puppet. I have never heard of anyone or anything that could comes even close to controlling a dragon’s mind. If this thing can, it could certainly control anything else with a weaker mind. Which pretty much sums up every living creature on the planet. Do you realize how incredibly dangerous that is?!” By this point Inquest now stood only a few inches in front of Crea, staring right into her eyes.</p><p>“So yes. Finding this thing does take precedent over saving lives.” With that he trotted past her and into the tunnel towards the exit. “Let’s go, there’s nothing here. Whatever it was, it didn’t leave anything behind.”</p><p>There was nothing Crea could say to that, she knew his reasoning was sound and there was no arguing against it. After all they’d been through over the decades, she knew more about him than anyone, pony or otherwise. Despite how much she loved that crazy old unicorn, she also hated how cold and logical he could be.</p><p>There had been many occasions, too many to count where they would fight till daybreak on what action to take. Whether to sacrifice a few for the greater good, or save them and risk a mission. Most of all, this calculative side of him frightened her, not because of how capable and powerful he was, she knew deep down he would never betray the Princess or his homeland.</p><p>What she feared most was....</p><p>“Would you sacrifice me for the greater good?” Crea asked under her breath.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Crea let out another sigh, “Nothing.” She turned and followed the pony back to the cold night air of the Everfree.</p><hr/><p>Darkness.</p><p>It was all that greeted me when I....<i>awoke</i>. That’s probably not the right word for it. Perhaps becoming <i>aware</i> is a more accurate term.</p><p>Whatever the case, I still found myself in the same perpetual darkness as before. Yet it felt different, familiar even. Despite the lack of light I could still see myself as clear as day, as if my body itself was glowing. Looking down, the darkness continued to stretch infinitely past my feet as I stood on a nonexistent floor.</p><p>“The hell is going on?” There was a slight lag between speaking and actually hearing my own voice. The entire experience felt surreal, like a dream.</p><p>“Hello!! Can anyone hear me!?” Nothing, not even an echo called back. That’s when I came to realize how quiet it was, not in terms of sound but of presence.</p><p>“You there?” I asked hoping to hear that familiar voice in my mind. I waited for a moment but no voice answered. Knowing that I was truly alone actually made me feel lonely and naked, perhaps because I’d spent every waking moment with <i>him</i> around.</p><p>With nothing else to do I started walking in a random direction, which gave me an odd sensation since I couldn’t feel the ground below. As I walked I kept straining my eye over the darkness, trying and hoping to spot anything or anyone.</p><p>After several minutes I eventually started thinking about the battle. Last I remembered, Falnor had been completely creamed by Luna, but Bronze and I also got caught in her spell. I wondered how she actually managed to do....whatever it was she did. As ridiculous as it sounded I still believed she had somehow altered gravity to her favor. How that was possible was beyond me, but then again I just fought a dragon alongside a drunk pegasus.</p><p>So whatever.</p><p>Inevitably I started thinking about what actually happened after and to wonder exactly how I came to be in this place. I remembered the pain and how it all suddenly just disappeared, it was vague but I also remembered that weird sensation. Something....happened. I couldn’t say for certain and I don’t know how I know, but I knew that something broke.</p><p>Was it my mind? Am I a vegetable now? Was this place the result of that? Was I to wonder there forever?</p><p>I quickened my pace as those questions continued to echo in my mind, as much as I wanted to know I was also afraid of the answer. It suddenly dawned on me to try and use my spells in here, at the least the fire might shed some light. Only to realize that I had no magic in me, that warm core in my gut where magic usually gathered was gone.</p><p>Logically it would mean weaving spells was impossible, but with an infinity of darkness ahead, I decided to give it a shot anyways. It was weird at first, I wasn’t sure how I would go about collecting magic without actually feeling it. I held my hand out in front of me and with my ‘Sense’ and ‘Sight’ - which made no difference considering the place was completely void of magic - I started imagining the familiar azure fireball in my hand.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/eb7dfb94119e1669e8616832e78e684035b4c5c7?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc01.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2013%2F113%2F4%2F4%2Fflame_hand_by_jtjandra-d62sh4d.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN: Credit of the picture goes to <a href="/user/Hollyhock" rel="nofollow">Hollyhock</a>]</p></div><p>To my surprise it worked, various shades of blue flame started gathering in the palm of my hand. But strangely they didn’t form into a sphere, in fact the fire coated my hand like a glove. Before I could react the fire started spreading up my arm as if I were drenched in gasoline. Startled I tried rubbing the fire off which only helped to spread it faster, once it got to my other hand it was too late.</p><p>I just waited and braced for whatever was to come as the flames quickly enveloped me within seconds. Yet I felt nothing, or to be more accurate I felt no discomfort. The fire was actually warm to the touch which I appreciated in this empty place. I continued to examine myself just to be sure nothing was happening when I noticed something move in the distance.</p><p>What I thought was movement was actually the darkness bending and shifting away from the light of the fire. For a moment it looked like the black was being eaten away and replaced by a white background. But it wasn’t entirely white, in front of me was a shadowy figure that looked like a cloaked and hooded person.</p><p>Slowly it started to focus and I saw what looked like a gas mask. It covered the face completely covering the eyes with a dark glossy surface. As I suspected he had a hood over his head and a dark cloak that hooked to his shoulders and fell on his back.</p><p>Then it hit me.</p><p>“Darth Vader?” It was definitely him; the gask mask, the cloak, it was surely him. The big Sith himself.</p><p>“Dafuq!?” He didn’t move, in fact there was something off about the whole thing. While the darkness had receded away, only the upper half of the body showed. I calmed myself and took a second look, it was then that I noticed a scribble on the bottom. I immediately recognized the writing, I’d been looking at it for almost my entire childhood.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>May the force be with you, Ralph McQuirre</b></p></div><p>I immediately whirled around and examined my surrounding. While I was fixated on Vader the darkness had all but disappeared, revealing a colorless room that I knew all too well.</p><p>It was my room, specifically the room I grew up in at my parent’s house. Aside from being void of color everything was as I remembered it before I moved out. The creaky old chair with a broken leg that I fixed with duct tape, that old study desk that god knows how many times I’d spilled food on, my bed with a spring that poked my sides for half my life, and all the posters adorning the wall. Including one of my prized possessions; a Darth Vader poster signed by Ralph McQuirre himself.</p><p>It was too much. All too sudden. I fell to my knees completely stunned, unable to believe what I was seeing.</p><br/><br/><p>“I’m home.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 34 - Sorrow and loss<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock<br/>Illustration by Al3xguerra.deviantart.com (Hollyhock)</p><hr/><p><i>‘I’m home.’</i></p><p>I lost track of time just sitting there on my knees, my entire body limp as I stared at my room. It took a while before I realized that my whole being was still engulfed in blue flames while the world remained as colorless as before. Only different shades of gray gave clue to what things  in the room were, though I could easily use my memory to fill them in. </p><p>“This can’t be real,” I mumbled. Much as I wanted to believe - and I would give anything for it to be - it’s just.....not. Considering the how things appeared it would probably be more realistic to call the whole thing a dream.</p><p>An extremely lucid one.</p><p>After some time the shock eventually faded away letting me think more clearly. I began by inspecting myself, specifically the flames dancing all over me. The unnatural blue hue certainly suggested that it was my magic; but then where did it come from? Prior to making it I was completely devoid of magic and it didn’t look like I could control it. The inconsistency further suggested that the whole thing, what I was experiencing wasn’t real.</p><p>Realizing I wasn’t really going anywhere, I turned my attention to my surroundings. I scrutinized every detail, every crack and stain that I knew hoping to detect anything that might give me a clue as to what it was all about. Though most of what I remembered about my room was there, I also noticed something different.</p><p>Nothing visual though, it was more like a feeling. Aside from a epic dose of nostalgia and homesickness, my instinct kept prodding the back of my mind but I just couldn’t put my finger on it. There was just something off about my room.</p><p>But before I could ponder on it further, something disrupted the silence. Nothing loud or sudden, in fact it was just in the edge of my hearing, too subtle for me to notice until then. Having spent nearly two-thirds of my life in that house, I was able to immediately tell it came from the living room below.</p><p>Voices.</p><p>“Mom! Dad!” Despite already telling myself it couldn’t be real, I couldn’t contain the excitement and joy of seeing my family again.</p><p>I immediately pushed myself back up and was ready to leap out the door and run down the stairs. But as soon I stood up everything around me suddenly swirled about like dust being blown away. All the grey that seemed to make up the place kept circling around me as if I was caught in the very center of a whirling tornado of gray ash.</p><p>The next moment I started to hear voices. At first they were  too muffled to discern but growing louder with every passing moment. Just as quick as it had begun,  the dust started to settle, shadows started to form and I could already make out the rough image of a large chair in front of me. In a second or two everything fell into place and like before, I immediately recognized the living room.</p><p>A person stood leaning on the chair in front of me, a man with large shoulders with a bit of fat in his stomach.</p><p>“Dad.” It was most certainly him, he had shaved his mustache but it was definitely him. He was silent and just stared to the left, from his eyes I could tell he was somewhere deep in thought.</p><p>“Dad!!” I shouted as I reached out to grab his shoulder, only for it to pass right through. His shoulder and half his head was blown away just like dust before it regrouped and fell back into place. He didn’t react whatsoever, just kept staring off somewhere.</p><p>“DAD!!” I screamed again, louder even but he didn’t even bat an eye. I reached out over and over again, even tried punching him out of desperation but no matter what I did he just wouldn’t look at me.</p><p>Like before, I was too engrossed on what was in front of me to notice my surroundings. Only then did I realize the number of people around me. The whole living room was packed with gray figures of people standing about.</p><p>People I knew.</p><p>“Mr.Andrew?” My high school math teacher.</p><p>“Dr.Song?” My pediatrician, who was also a family friend.</p><p>“What the hell!?” Everywhere I looked there were people I had some relationship with. Uncles, aunts, childhood friends, college friends, hell even the lady from the dinner I frequently visit.</p><p>I then noticed they all wore formal dark attires.</p><p>“No....” I leaped at Jo, a beautiful redhead who I’ve had a crush on since middle school. “Jo I’m right here! Please tell me you can see me! Hear me!”</p><p>Nothing. She just stared at her empty cup in silence next to someone, and just like my father I couldn’t touch her.</p><p>“Jerry!” I shouted recognizing the man next to her. He was a skinny blonde and one of the oldest friends I’d ever had. “C’mon dude! You’ve got that psychic supernatural aunt of yours, tell me that shit runs in the family!”</p><p>Nothing. He looked right through me as if I didn’t exist.</p><p>“C’MON!!!” I bellowed. “Anyone!! Please for the love of...,” and then I saw her.</p><p>“Mom?”</p><p>Like everyone else, she too wore something formal and dark. She sat on the sofa with aunt Lydia next to her looking extremely distraught. There was something different about her, she looked older than I remembered with more wrinkles on her face and less color in her hair. She was staring at a large picture frame standing on the table in front of her with fresh tears covering her cheeks.</p><p>Slowly and fearfully I started walking towards her, I had my suspicion but I still had to see it. I moved around once I reached the table and sure enough, the large frame held a picture of me.</p><p>It was my grieving.</p><p>“Oh god please no,” I crouched and looked right at my mother’s eyes. “Please tell me you didn’t give up. Tell me you’re still looking.” Tears continued to flow endlessly as she gazed lovingly at the frame, oblivious that I was right in front of her.</p><p>“I’m not dead! Don’t give up!” I reached out with my burning hand and caressed her cheek trying to wipe her tears away, but even that was denied to me. Like fire to gasoline the sight of my shackled hand ignited an anger I never knew was possible. </p><p>With clenched teeth I immediately started ripping the chains off, hoping that somehow they were the only things preventing me from going home. I desperately tried sticking my fingers under but they were bound too tight. I even went so far as to bite at them. But no matter what I did, no matter how hard I pulled and struggled they just wouldn’t come off. They didn’t even budge or slide over as if it had fused together with my skin. </p><p>My failure only added more fuel to the rage, I clenched my hands into fists and ground my teeth. In response the flames covering my body fluctuated and grew, seeming to cause a rippling effect over the scenery. By the time I got back up to my feet everything was deforming to a point where it looked like I was seeing through distorted glass.</p><p>“I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!!!” I screamed with both hands fisted at the side. “You think this is funny!? Are you enjoying this you sick fuck!!” I didn’t know who I was screaming at, and I really didn’t care if it was god, destiny, fate or whatever. I had to vent out all this anger and rage from the torture of witnessing my own grieving and being reminded of what I’d lost. All the anguish and sorrow, having everything taken away; the pain that had been healing came anew.</p><p>“Why don’t you just kill me?! Why put me through all this!? You took everything! Ripped me away from home! For what!? FUCKING PONIES!?” I didn’t know why but I waited, expecting an answer I knew would never come.</p><p>“AAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!” Maddened with rage I started screaming and bellowing without restraint, the flames continued to reach higher resembling a blue pillar more than anything else. The more it grew the greater the ripples and eventually everything became too warped to make out.</p><p>Despite how radiant and large the fire grew, the dark from before slowly creeped back towards me, eating the gray world bit by bit. But I didn’t care, I fell back to my knees and started pounding the nonexistent floor with my fists. Like living slime the darkness crept up my leg and slowly worked its way up my body and to my face, snuffing out the fire as it went. Just before it all faded away, I caught a last clear glimpse of my mother’s face still wet with tears.</p><p>One last torment before the darkness swallowed me again.</p><hr/><p>“You two need to calm down,” commented Spike as he watched the two mares trot around in restlessly in a circle. Twilight and Shine turned their attention to the young dragon as he stretched and yawned in one of the chairs attached to the wall of the hospital. </p><p>“Calm!? How can you be so carefree like that?” Twilight shot her hoof to point at the red light above the large double doors nearby. “Rodney’s in critical condition right now! Who knows how serious his injuries are!”</p><p>“Didn’t you see the guards carrying him here?” added Shine with the same level of worry. “There was so much blood, who knows how serious his injuries are.” Shine closed her eyes and shivered in fright.</p><p>“What’s more....,” Twilight started.</p><p>“Princess Celestia is coming here,” finished Shine. “She ordered me to keep close watch over him and now he might not make it!”</p><p>“And I was suppose to keep him out of trouble, he was in my charge!” Twilight continued. “When the Princess finds out...”</p><p>“She’ll probably send me to the old dungeon!”</p><p>“Or send me back to magic kindergarden!” </p><p><i>‘Ah great, now there’s two of them,’</i> thought Spike shaking his head in disbelief.</p><p>“I never said I wasn’t worried,” Spike started in an attempt to calm the mares, “but how does fretting around accomplish anything? He’s in the hospital being treated as we speak and Princess Luna is dealing with the dragon, so everything that needs to be done has been done. If you ask me I’m more worried about all those royal guards, they got it worse than anypony else.”</p><p>Spike turned to gaze down the long white hallway towards the far side where a multitude of ponies are rushing back and forth in a hurry. Most were nurses tending to the less injured of guard while doctors from the town and Canterlot dealt with the more serious injuries. Thankfully nopony lost their lives, no doubt due to the heroic actions of a particular cyan pegasus.</p><p>“I...I suppose you’re right,” Twilight let out a sigh. “I just wish there was more that I could do for-” she voice suddenly cut off her eyes widening in surprise. “Princess Luna!”</p><p>Both Spike and Shine turned their heads to down the hallway just as the dark alicorn turned the corner towards them followed by a pair of night guards. Despite fighting a dragon there were little signs upon the regent that would suggest such a battle with only a few darker patches over her coat, an indication of how one sided it was. Spike made his way to stand beside Twilight before all three gave a respectful bow in unison.</p><p>“Princess Luna,” they greeted.</p><p>“Twilight Sparkle, Spike, and if I’m not mistaken; your name is Shine Bright.” Twilight couldn’t help but smile noticing that the Princess was speaking in a more up-to-date manner.</p><p>“Yes, your majesty. It’s an honor you remember,” replied Shine reverently.</p><p>“Uhm, Princess,” Twilight spoke as she got back up, “should you be here? I mean, what about the dragon?”</p><p>“Worry not Twilight, I have taken measures to keep him restraint for questioning. He is currently under watch afar from Ponyville. Celestia is dealing with another matter and I am here in her stead.”</p><p>“Oh, I see.” Twilight couldn’t help but wonder what could be more important that her mentor couldn’t oversee the first dragon attack since the treaty. </p><p>“How is he? I wish to know of Rodney’s condition.” Luna looked onto the red light above the doors. “Are the doctors still administering treatment?”</p><p>“Hm? Oh, yes they are. Along with the town veterinarian; Dr.Mane Goodall.” Luna looked at Twilight with a raised brow. “Well none of the doctors here know how to properly treat him due to limited knowledge of his physiology. Since Dr.Mane has experience dealing with a variety of animals, they believe she could offer some insight in the mat-.”</p><p>Before Twilight could finish the light above the light suddenly winked out. Soon enough, the doors opened revealing an earth mare and a stallion unicorn wearing white doctor’s garment. Twilight and Shine flinched when they saw how much blood marred their clothes.</p><p>The unicorn was of average build with a cream colored coat with a brown mane and tail, as per his vocation he also bore a mark depicting a heart monitor. The mare had a light golden coat while her mane and tail were two shades of blue. It was obvious she was the vet based on her mark which consist of three animals; a dog’s head, a cat’s head, and a small white bird.</p><p>“Princess Luna?” spoke the stallion in surprise. He and the mare immediately gave a bow to the monarch.</p><p>“We can skip the formalities good doctor, I wish to know of the human’s well being.”</p><p>“Of course Your Highness,” the stallion gave a small cough as he started to speak as a professional. “I am Dr.Stable and this,” he pointed to the mare with a hoof, “is Dr.Goodall.”</p><p>“Your Highness,” greeted the mare.</p><p>“Thanks to her advice as a vet we were able to properly examine and treat the human,” continued Stable. “Not being able to rely on our spells or machines made it rather challenging but we can safely say that he’ll be fine.” Twilight and Shine let out an audible sigh of relief.</p><p>“Wait a minute. If you didn't use magic then how were you able to perform an operation on him?” asked Twilight.</p><p>Dr.Goodall looked at Twilight in confusion, “Operation? Why would we need to operate on him?”</p><p>“But...but he was bleeding everywhere,” answered Twilight.</p><p>“And isn’t this room reserved for critical treatment?” Shine added. Both doctor’s eyes widened slightly in realization.</p><p>“Oh that was very thoughtless of me,” spoke Dr.Stable. “I should’ve explained earlier. No we did not operate on him or conduct any invasive procedures, there was no need.”</p><p>“The blood wasn’t his,” explained Dr.Goodall, “It’s dragonblood. His injuries mainly involve a somewhat significant amount of muscle damage along with some minor internal bleeding but it’s nothing life threatening. He also suffered some lacerations but they’re mostly superficial, one or two required a bit of stitching but again, nothing serious.”</p><p>“We also suspect some minor fractures on one or two bones but until we get proper skeletal imaging done we’ll have to work with him to know for sure; As for the room well, with the all guards and townsfolk being administered to, there’s no place else to do it. I apologize for not informing you earlier.”</p><p>“There is however, something that concerns us,” added Dr.Goodall in a way that made Twilight and Shine’s ears twitch.</p><p>“The examination went perfectly fine since the patient remained unconscious, however we couldn’t figure out why. We hoped it’s due to the amount of mental stress and exhaustion he suffered. We agreed to let him be for the time being and wait for any development.” Dr.Stable turned to face to Luna. “Will that be all Your Highness?”</p><p>“It is, thank you doctors,” answered Luna with an approving nod.</p><p>“I better join the others then. I may be a vet but I know enough to help out.” With another bow Dr.Goodall turned and trotted down the hallway towards the commotion.</p><p>“May we see him?” Shine asked.</p><p>“Of course,” answered Dr.Stable. “But keep in mind he is still in recovery. If you’ll follow me, I’ll take you to his-” before she could finish there came hoofsteps from the corner as two familiar ponies came into view.</p><p>“Twilight!” shouted the white filly as she started to gallop. “Is Rodney ok?” She skidded to a halt several feet away once she realized Luna’s presence, before giving a rather awkward and hurried bow.</p><p>Following behind her was Rarity who looked completely rattled from the incident. She still had several mane rollers dangling from her head while a few splotches of beauty night products covered her face. Realizing royalty was near her entire body glowed momentarily together with her horn as she hurriedly fixed her appearance with a spell. The rollers flew away while the makeup disappeared without a trace, making her look as elegant and pristine as ever. </p><p>“Princess Luna,” she greeted with a perfect bow trying her best to remain composed.</p><p>“Princess Luna,” repeated Sweetie Belle after receiving a small nudge from Rarity.</p><p>“Rarity, bearer of Generosity. It is good to see you unharmed.”</p><p>“No doubt thanks to you Princess,” she replied before getting back up. “I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but Sweetie Belle told me Rodney was here? I am awfully worried about him.”</p><p>“Of course not, in fact I came for that very same reason.” Luna tilted her head towards the doctor and the group. “We have just learned that he is not in any danger.”</p><p>“So he’ll be ok!?” shouted Sweetie Belle ecstatically with a small hop.</p><p>“He is, child,” answered Luna smiling pleasantly.</p><p>“If you’ll follow me,” spoke Dr.Stable a second time, “I can take you to him.” Without a word Sweetie Belle galloped right past Luna to stand beside the doctor.</p><p>“Sweetie Belle!” scolded Rarity in a quiet tone. “Please excuse her Your Majesty.”</p><p>“Tis alright, it warms my heart to see her care so dearly for him.”</p><p>“Thank you Your Highness.” Rarity gave another bow before joining the group.</p><p>“Twilight,” called Luna just before the doctor was about to show them the way. “A word please.”</p><p>“You guys go ahead, I’ll catch up later.”</p><p>“He’ll be in room two-eleven, just ask any of the nurses for directions”</p><p>“Thank you doctor.” With that they all started following the doctor away, leaving behind Twilight alone with Luna.</p><p>The monarch waited until they turned the corner before she started speaking. “Is it broken?”</p><p>The question caught her off guard. “What?”</p><p>“The band Twilight, is it broken?” Twilight looked hesitantly at the two guards behind the alicorn. “Do not worry, they are trustworthy. Now answer the question.”</p><p>“No, it isn’t,” she answered nervously. “Well, actually I’m....not so sure.” One of Luna’s brow rose slightly.</p><p>Twilight lifted her right hoof in front of her and with a simple spell parted the fur near her knee. There, perfectly hidden under the fur, was a small metal string that tied around her limb. From afar it would appear to be a regular metal wiring, but if one were to take a closer look they would notice the many minute yet detailed runes etched all over the surface. Something impossible to do without the aid of magic. </p><p>“It’s not broken, but it’s also not active,” she explained. “I don’t know what’s happened to it.”</p><p>“Likely a precaution.”</p><p>“A precaution?”</p><p>“From Celestia. I wager she implemented a spell to take effect should the band fail. Or close to it. Likely the band is simply inactive or something similar to such. Perhaps it is also the reason for Rodney’s continued unconsciousness, in order to keep him in sedated should our fears prove true.”</p><p>“But he wasn’t! In fact he was risking his life to protect us!” realizing she was shouting aloud to royalty, Twilight quickly quieted herself.</p><p>“True. But that is not enough.”</p><p>“How is that not enough?”</p><p>“Because it’s not his character that we fear Twilight. The Rodney that we currently know may perhaps be worthy of our trust, especially with this feat. But the real question lies in whether he remains so once he discovers his real potential.”</p><p>“I....don’t understand.”</p><p>Luna let out a sigh. “Power corrupts Twilight Sparkle. Believe me, I know.”</p><p>Though it was brief, Twilight detected a pained look from Luna. “Princess that was a long-”</p><p>“I do not wish to talk about it,” Luna cut in. She took a long deep breath as she dismissed those memories. “But back to the matter at hoof. If I understand the situation correctly, it is likely that Rodney has yet to discover our secret. It is best that you bind him before he awakes and discovers the truth.”</p><p>“Princess I don’t....I’m not comfortable with this anymore.” Twilight started fidgeting with her front hooves nervously. “I understand <i>why</i> it needs to be done but this....it’s causing him so much pain.”</p><p>“I know Twilight Sparkle. You have developed a relationship with one another.”</p><p>Twilight’s cheeks went from purple to beet red in a second. “We-we’re not in a relationship! Who said anything about a relationship!?”</p><p>Luna’s brow rose again. “I speak of friendship and trust Twilight.”</p><p>Twilight’s eyes widened. “Oh, uhm...yes of course you are,” she quickly spoke feeling very embarrassed.</p><p>“By doing this, you feel as though you are betraying him.”</p><p>Twilight’s ears fell to the side as her head sunk low. “....Yes.”</p><p>“It is unfair I know, but I still ask this of you. Celestia and I cannot risk the possibility of him going rogue, especially with his potential. Until we know for certain, measures must be taken. To simply trust him is too great a risk.” As a pony of reason and logic, Twilight perfectly understood Luna’s reasonings. But that didn’t make it any less easy, especially knowing how much pain it caused him.</p><p>“I.....I understand Your Highness,” spoke Twilight in a low tone. “I’ll find a way to do it tonight.”</p><p>“Thank you Twilight,” Luna bent low and whispered in the unicorn’s ear in a comforting tone. “I know this is difficult for you. But it’s for the best.”</p><p>“Yes Princess.” Luna gave her a gentle smile before finally turning around and trotting away leaving Twilight alone with her thoughts. </p><p><i>‘Guess I’ll have to wait till everypony’s asleep,’</i> she thought before another entered her mind. </p><p>“Uh, Princess,” Twilight called.</p><p>“Yes?” replied Luna as she glanced back. </p><p>“If you don’t mind me asking, who made the band? I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p><p>“I did,” Luna answered causally. “The very idea was mine alone Twilight.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes, though I originally wanted Rodney to be aware of it. But, Celestia convinced me otherwise. Is that all?”</p><p>“Uhm, yes. Thank you.”</p><p>“Good night Twilight,” spoke Luna as she turned and continued on her way. </p><p>“Good night Your Majesty.” With her task weighing heavy in her heart, Twilight turned and trotted in the opposite direction to catch up with the rest.</p><hr/><p>Pain. That was the first thing that greeted me when I finally regained consciousness. Even before I opened my eyes I was assaulted from every part of my body, but I felt relieved by it. It was living pain, one from bruised muscles, torn skin, and contusions, something that could only be felt if you are alive.</p><p>With a slight grunt I cracked open an eye only to find darkness all around me. For a moment I thought I was still in that dark place but then I noticed the faint light emanating from my left. I looked and saw a series of windows that nearly covered the wall from side to side, outside I saw the moon silently hovering in the sky giving just enough light to illuminate the room. Ignoring the painful protests of my body I pushed up to a sitting position and observed my surroundings. </p><p>With the smell of antiseptic heavy in the air and the decoration of the room it was obvious I was in a hospital. Especially since I was wearing nothing but a single piece gown that resembled a table cloth. In fact the frills on the edges certainly suggested I <i>was</i> wearing one. There were bandages covering nearly my entire upper body and I could smell the scent of medicine from them.</p><p>Then I remembered. The dream, my home, my family.</p><p>My grieving.</p><p>I looked at my hands and sure enough the shackles were still there. Like opening the floodgates all the rage, anguish, and anger came rushing back. I clenched my fist and tightened my body pulling every muscle causing them to protest further. Without any thought or intent blue flames erupted from my hands and started spreading up my arm. I could ‘feel’ the magic continuing to build up, drawing from my reserve more and more till the fire illuminated the entire room.</p><p>That’s when I spotted a small bundle of fur curled up at the end of the bed. Right between my legs was a small white filly laying on her belly with legs wrapped under, while her body rose up and down as she slept. For a moment everything stopped, my mind went blank as I watched her.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/5827e944a803df4cf123200711a65ee1970835f8?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc03.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Fi%2F2013%2F126%2F1%2Fe%2Fbelle_sleep_by_jtjandra-d64ebx5.jpg" /></p></div><p>“Sweetie Belle,” I mumbled. I took my eyes off her and gave the room a second glance. On the floor against the far wall lay several mattresses and pillows with ponies sleeping on them. I spotted Twilight, Spike, Rarity and even the brown earth mare that brought me the sapphire, all covered in blankets, their chests moving rhythmically as they breathed.</p><p>My attention turned back to Sweetie Belle when she let out a small mewing sound with a slight shiver. Like water snuffing a fire, all that rage I had felt a few seconds before just melted away. It was unfair, I couldn’t even have someone to blame, something to focus all that anger. She was innocent; they’re all innocent.</p><p>With a long breath to calm myself, I siphoned all the magic back before my emotions got the better of me. Had I remained crazed with anger I would have definitely done something I’d regret. </p><p>“Sweetie Belle,” I mumbled a second time. What was it about this kid? She was the one who kept me from running away when the dragon came. I could remember how furious I became when I imagined Falnor harming her, enough to motivate me through the encounter. Now even the sight of her sleeping form was enough to quench my emotions, to stop me before I made a grave mistake.</p><p>Was it simply because I grew to care for her? It was inevitable that I’d form some kind of bond with those ponies as time passed by. But why did I care so much for her to risk my life? Even back home there were very few people I’d care enough to go that far. Because I lived and shared my daily life with her? Or maybe I’d unintentionally used her as a substitute, something to replace and act as a buffer for the things I’d lost. </p><p>I shook my head dismissing that train of thought, it was too much to think with my emotions going haywire like that. I continued to gaze at the filly for a moment before stretching out my hand towards her. Ignoring the aches and pain from my arm, I cast a levitation on the filly causing blue fire to burst out of thin air and wrap itself around her whole body.</p><p>Unlike before where the fire danced about erratically, now the flames spread like water barely flickering and appearing more like smoke or mist. With a thought, I carefully lifted the filly and pulled her towards me keeping her hovering a feet or so from the bed. I settled her to my left just next to my body causing her to stir, but luckily she didn’t wake. Pulling my blanket over her, I slowly laid back and rested my head on the pillow while gently placing my left hand on the back of her head, just behind her small horn.</p><p>I could feel her mane and coat on my skin, silky and soft like a plush toy, yet warm to the touch. Sensing the warmth of my body she repositioned herself to push against me causing her horn to poke somewhat irritably at my side. With my hand still on her I felt her body rise with each breath and eventually my breathing joined her rhythm.</p><p>Sleep didn’t come easy, even though Sweetie Belle might have helped rid my anger, it did nothing to soften the anguish. I fell into the sorrow and loss once again, all the turmoil and heartache of losing everything rekindled. It was inevitable to feel some anger and animosity from that, but every time I would focus on the filly sleeping peacefully next to me, and everytime it would all go away.</p><p>Sleep may not have come easy, but at least the nightmare didn’t return.</p><p>Just the usual dream of red meat.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 35 - Haflax<br/>Edited by Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read by Hollyhock</p><p>　</p><hr/><p>In an isolated clearing, far from Ponyville; bound by at least a hundred meters worth of cold, hard, spell-empowered chains...lay a massive green dragon. There were a multitude of wounds strewn all over the drake’s body and nearly half of his entire body showed exposed flesh rather than scales. Fortunately, none of these were life threatening to such a gargantuan being. The wounds could have still been considered superficial and would heal easily on their own.</p><p>Without a doubt the most severe injury had to be to the left wing. While some parts of the webbing had been stitched back together; most were simply cut off. There were far too many damaged. More harm would be done trying to heal them, rather than to grow new webbing. In order to further quicken the healing process, the dragon was wrapped in thick layers of cloth dipped in various ointments and medicines. The exposed wounds were kept disinfected and clean. His broken wing was bound together with long metal pipes to keep it properly aligned.</p><p>&quot;P....please.....&quot;</p><p>Celestia watched as the green dragon continued to beg and plead in a wheezing voice.</p><p>&quot;Please.....don’t...don’t take her away...&quot;</p><p>Though Celestia had come to tolerate and even accept dragon kind to live in Equestria. Somewhere deep down, she still felt somewhat apprehensive towards them. Memories came and went throughout her immortal life, but certain experiences had made impressions on the demi-god that were harder to forget. The term ‘dragon’ had only just come to existence after the treaty was signed less than two centuries ago. Originally their kind had been called ‘drakes’. Following the treaty, the term dragon began to be used to refer to drakes that had left their homeland to live abroad. Drakes, as they themselves preferred to be called, were those that choose to remain to live the same brutal and violent life from centuries past. There were even a few ancient drakes, most of them clan leaders, who had battled Celestia herself and lived.</p><p>Their wanton desire to expand their territory and influence amongst each other, often at the cost of life, was something she loathed. Their entire culture was based upon subjugating and standing above one another. The fact that their race had existed for so long with such a barbaric culture, was simply due to how powerful they were as a species. The violence and brutality made it clear that only the strong would survive. It eventually came to a point where a great number sought refuge in other lands.</p><p>Thus, the Treaty of Brakas was created. Brakas v’Sana was the drake matriarch who first proposed the peace between drakes and all the greater nations of the world. Many ponies mistakenly assumed that Brakas v’Sana sought peace. But in truth she merely wanted to rid her lands of drakes she deemed too weak to serve her purposes. Unlike the traditional power struggle with numbers, she prefered quality over quantity. This idea gained popularity amongst the other matriarchs and the treaty was established not a decade later. Today Braka stands as the Grand Matriarch and rules over the largest and most powerful drake clan.</p><p>Of course the drakes talked of this treaty under a different name.</p><p>The Prideless Peace.</p><p>For in the eyes of the drakes, those who took the treaty as an opportunity to migrate had all but abandoned what it meant to be a drake. Too weak to fight, too weak to protect what was theirs, and too weak to even live in the land where they hatched.</p><p>Centuries before the treaty between Equestria and the collective drake clans was established; the sight of a wounded drake was a common thing. Especially in the southern coasts where ambitious drakes would often attempt to expand their territory into Equestria by invading settlements. There the Equestrian Guard and citizens were forced to live in constant danger with one eye to the sky. Always ready and alert to repel one attack to another. After many hard won battles the small settlements eventually grew to what is became known as the prospering city of Baltimare.</p><p>But this was different.</p><p>Though the green dragon was looking towards her. He wasn’t really looking <i>at</i> her. In fact he really wasn’t looking at anyone or anything in particular. His eyes were watery and glazed over. A pool of saliva gathered near his open mouth. Before she arrived, the guards stationed on watch reported that he constantly mumbled the same thing over and over again. It didn’t matter whether or not anypony was present to listen, as if he didn’t even register the world around him.</p><p>It had been centuries since Celestia last battled a dragon, yet she still remembered and respected them as worthy adversaries. For a dragon to be reduced to something so piteous, the sun monarch couldn’t help but feel slightly disturbed at the sight.</p><p>&quot;I had him restrained after Luna subdued him,&quot; Celestia spoke in a hushed tone. &quot;Do not worry, we have tended to his wounds and his life is not in any danger. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for his state of mind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Was he like this before? During the fight?&quot;</p><p>Celestia turned and craned her neck back to gaze up high. Right next to her, sitting on her hind legs was a massive silver scaled dragoness. Even under the moonlight her scales gleamed beautifully, creating an aura of soft white light; but the sight of the dragoness soaring high in the sky under the radiant sun was even more spectacular.</p><p>Dragons and ponies in general were both, socially female dominant. In Equestria’s case; it was mainly due to the imbalanced ratio between mares and stallions. Though having the head of state being female for over a millennia might have also been a factor. For dragons, the females simply outclassed males in terms of strength, magic, and sheer size. Of course dragons have vowed to forsake their culture and subject themselves to the law of the land, but despite that females still act as the ruling power in almost every dragon community.</p><p>This silver dragoness for instance; was the current head of the dragon clan in Equestria.</p><p>&quot;No, Luna and my guards that confronted him reported nothing of the sort,&quot; Celestia answered. &quot;Other than the sudden aggression of course.&quot;</p><p>There was silence as the dragoness eyes linger over the dragon’s many injuries. &quot;Some of these appear to be....over excessive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I apologize. Luna’s....contempt for your kind is still fresh. She has yet to adjust to the many changes of the current age. Before her banishment a peace treaty between Equestria and dragons was a far-fetched idea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; replied the dragoness dismissing the topic. &quot;Allow me.&quot; Celestia watched as the silver dragoness stepped forward, shaking the ground with each stride until she stood right in front of the wounded dragon.</p><p>&quot;Falnor,&quot; she called with a voice of authority.</p><p>&quot;Don’t take her, please....,&quot; he replied in that same wheezing voice. The dragoness turned to Celestia looking for an explanation but the alicorn merely shrugged.</p><p>&quot;Falnor,&quot; she called again in a more demanding tone. That time he didn’t reply, he merely gazed off into the distance as more saliva oozed out of his open mouth.</p><p>&quot;Falnor d’Zayak!!&quot; the dragoness suddenly bellowed, causing Celestia and the guards nearby to flinch in surprise. For several seconds the thundering voice echoed in the distance.</p><p>For the first time since he awoke, Celestia noticed some clarity in Falnor’s eyes as it focused on the silver dragon in front of him.</p><p>&quot;....Neval,&quot; he grumbled in a weak voice. The silver dragoness let out a low threatening growl. &quot;Neval Quinarth,&quot; Falnor called a second time in the proper manner.</p><p>&quot;Now answer me; why did you attack the Ponies?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Neval, please. I couldn’t...don’t let them take her from me.&quot;</p><p>Neval lowered her head till it was only a few feet away from Falnor before speaking in a calm tone. &quot;Take who? Who is ‘she’?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My....daughter.&quot; Neval’s eyes widened while her body flinched slightly surprised by the answer.</p><p>&quot;Rest assured we had no such intentions,&quot; Celestia quickly added. &quot;We were merely reacting to his actions and our records show he had no family.&quot;</p><p>Neval ignored her and continued. &quot;Falnor, listen to me,&quot; she waited for a moment letting her words sink in. &quot;You have no daughter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No....she’s...I&quot;</p><p>&quot;Falnor! You have no daughter!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You lie!&quot; For the first time since his capture, Falnor suddenly flexed and squirm against his restraint. All the guards nearby immediately leapt to action only to be halted by a raised wing from Celestia. Even if Falnor somehow undid his bindings there was nothing he could do, not with an Alicorn and a dragoness present to stop him.</p><p>&quot;Falnor!!&quot; shouted Neval hoping to calm him down but failing as Falnor continue to thrash about causing the ground to tremble. Celestia noticed blood started spewing forth from his wounds, while red blotches started to spread all over the cloth wrapped around him.</p><p>&quot;You won’t take her! None of you will take her!!&quot; This time Neval placed one of her massive claws on top of his prone body, pushing down and forcing him to remain still before his wounds worsen.</p><p>&quot;Still yourself Falnor!!&quot; Neval shouted louder than ever. Despite being bound, wounded, tired, and struggling against the might of a dragoness; Falnor kept resisting and was actually starting to overpower Neval’s grip.</p><p>Realizing that this was quickly getting out of control, Neval suddenly took a deep breath before her chest started to glow slightly. Celestia watched as white smoke resembling mist started flowing out of Neval’s maw like an icy fog.</p><p>&quot;Sle~ep,&quot; she spoke in a long soothing tone as the smoke flowed and coated itself over Falnor’s head. Within a few moments his movements quickly dulled as his mind slowly drifted away as the white substance invaded Falnor’s lungs.</p><p>With a final deep growl Falnor fell to the ground, shaking the earth one final time with a loud thud sending a cloud of dirt to blow outwards. Neval continued to press her claw down on Falnor’s body until she finally felt the rhythmic rise and fall of his breathing.</p><p>Seeing the threat neutralized, the guards around the clearing went back to their place and resumed their vigilance while Celestia watched as Neval slowly pulled back her claw. She waited for the dragoness to turn around, but after awhile it was obvious that the dragoness was deep in thought, remaining in place and staring down at the unconscious green dragon.</p><p>&quot;From what we can determine,&quot; Celestia started after some time, &quot;his unusual behavior resembled those who suffer from an addiction. His state of mind certainly suggested mental instability.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Be careful what you say Celestia,&quot; replied Neval in a low tone before turning around to gaze at the alicorn. &quot;Falnor may have been an....oddity amongst us. But I consider him a trusted advisor and one of my closest clan mates. He was the first to join me when I choose the path of exile.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I meant no disrespect. But the question still remains; what could affect him so? Is it a disease then? Some sort of mental affliction?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are very few sickness or disease than can overcome a dragon’s vitality and I know most of them. But in all my knowledge and experience I have never seen or heard of anything that would result in....this.&quot; Neval turned once again to stare at Falnor’s sleeping form. &quot;And this <i>daughter</i> of his....&quot;</p><p>&quot;What of it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you know why he came here?&quot; asked Neval after a sigh that kicked up the surrounding dust.</p><p>The question caught Celestia slightly off guard. &quot;Self preservation,&quot; she answered. &quot;The only reason the drake clans agreed to the treaty was so that it encouraged the less...‘successful’ to leave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean the weak,&quot; replied Neith in a flat tone. &quot;It’s true, for many the choice of living a peaceful life to that of strife and servitude was a simple one. The competition was simply too much for them. But for a few it was also a matter of honor, preferring exile rather than serving under a new clan head. Even rarer however, are the likes of him.&quot;</p><p>Neval paused as Falnor let out a low growl in his sleep, his eyes darting about as he dreamt.</p><p>&quot;Had he chose to do so, Falnor could have easily remained a drake and lived comfortably. He was, and still is, as mighty as he was odd. His mind simply worked differently than most of our kind and he could conjure flames few knew were possible. Which begs the question how Luna was able to overpower him so easily.&quot; Neith let out another sigh as she looked sympathetically at the green dragon. &quot;But that is not important.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why did he leave?&quot; asked Celestia. Neith turned and looked at the alicorn in the eye.</p><p>&quot;Nightmares,&quot; she answered in low tone. &quot;He came here to flee from his nightmares.&quot;</p><p>　</p><p>　</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[The next day...]=========</p></div><p>　</p><p>　</p><p>&quot;Rodney!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;GAH!&quot; I yelped in pain as Sweetie Belle suddenly jumped right at my chest. Worse yet, her horn poked me squarely in the center and would have stabbed me through had it been any sharper.</p><p>Should’ve seen it coming when her face suddenly lit up with glee.</p><p>&quot;Ah Sweets!&quot; My body assaulted me with pain in protest as I tried to forcefully pry the filly off me, which took a lot more effort in my weakened state. My shout stirred the other ponies in the room arousing them from their sleep with several groggy mumbles.</p><p>&quot;Uhh, Sweetie Belle?&quot; Rarity called as she roused herself up. Even half asleep her voice still carried her usual air of elegance.</p><p>&quot;He’s awake!&quot; shouted the filly excitedly.</p><p>&quot;And in pain!&quot; I added as Sweetie Belle kept trying to wrap her small yet strong hooves around me again. Unfortunately the filly was listening in at the moment, probably too engrossed and happy.</p><p>&quot;What, aaaahhhhh....what was that?&quot; asked Twilight with a yawn as she woke up as well, followed by the light brown earth mare.</p><p>With another happy squeal from Sweetie Belle, and another loud painful yelp from me, everyone realized what all the commotion was about.</p><p>&quot;Rodney!!&quot; shouted Twilight and Rarity in sync. Both mares jumped right up and bolted to my bed, I could tell they were tempted to jump right on top of the bed like Sweetie Belle but luckily they had more self control.</p><p>After managing to pry Sweetie Belle off me a second time she suddenly erupted in bluish flames as I quickly levitated her away from me, and the pain slowly started to ebb away. I then carefully moved the filly off the bed and down to the floor next to Rarity.</p><p>&quot;Nobody do or say anything,&quot; I quickly ordered just before either mare could speak. &quot;Just...just give me a minute.&quot;</p><p>With a sigh I let myself fall back to the bed, causing me to groan audibly as pain sprung from every corner of my midsection. I was honestly surprised that they actually listened and kept silent for a moment while I closed my eyes and waited for it to fade away again. It didn’t disappear completely, waves of it from kept rolling through my entire body endlessly.</p><p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I finally spoke after another long sigh. &quot;Before any of you ask; I’m fine. Actually no, that’s not true. I feel like crap right now, but I’ll live.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good,&quot; replied Rarity before suddenly feeling a sharp pain on my side as she jabbed me with a hoof.</p><p>&quot;Aagh!&quot; I shouted in pain before getting back up to a sitting position and glaring right at her. &quot;The hell was that for!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is for taking Sweetie Belle out without first informing me!&quot; Rarity shouted angrily matching my glare with her own. &quot;Do you have ANY idea how frightened I was!? I searched every corner of the town dodging ponies left and right trying to find you two!!&quot;</p><p>My anger quickly disappeared when a tear trailed down her cheek and her voice started to crack.</p><p>&quot;It wasn’t his fault,&quot; Sweetie Belle spoke while leaning on one of Rarity’s hooves trying her best to console her.</p><p>&quot;I-I was so worried. I thought the dragon might have....nopony knew where you two were!&quot; I saw her raise a hoof for another jab but after what she said I could only remain silent and just take it.</p><p>I braced myself for the pain but instead of jabbing me Rarity got up on her hind hooves and pulled me into a tight hug.</p><p>&quot;Thank you for keeping her safe,&quot; she whispered. I could feel how truly grateful she was, never in all my life had I heard such sincere gratitude aimed at me.</p><p>&quot;I’d never let anything happen to her,&quot; I replied in a solemn tone. It was all I could say to her and surprisingly enough I find myself determined to uphold every word of it. Eventually though the pressure from the hug was becoming too painful to bear, but before I could say anything Rarity suddenly pushed herself away and poked me hard on my shoulder.</p><p>&quot;You better not mister!&quot; she shouted in a playful demanding tone. &quot;It’s improper to worry a lady so much, think of the wrinkles!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think that’s enough of that Rarity,&quot; said Twilight. &quot;My turn.&quot; Before I even registered what she said one of the giant pillows on the floor suddenly soared across the room right for my face.</p><p>&quot;What were you thinking taking on a dragon all by yourself!?&quot; Twilight yelled in tandem with the impact of the pillow. Just as I pulled that one off my face another hit me. &quot;Who would even think of doing something like that!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought that-uff!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! You weren’t thinking at all! If you did you’d realize how unimaginably outclassed you were in every sense. A dragon Rodney!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will you just sto-oph! Twilight I swear-phf! Stop it!!&quot; Only after she threw the last pillow did the barrage finally ceased.</p><p>This was not the ‘we’re happy you’re ok’ moment I expected.</p><p>&quot;You know something like; ‘Oh Rodney, thank you so much for saving the town’ would be nice,&quot; I said irritably while badly mimicking a mare’s higher pitched voice. &quot;Or how’s about ‘Oh we’re so happy you made it out alive’, is that so hard? At least Rarity-ugh!&quot;</p><p>I carefully grasped my right side when stabbing pain far more painful than anything else so far suddenly assaulted me.</p><p>&quot;Are you ok?&quot; spoke an unfamiliar voice. I turned and looked to the far wall where the light brown earth mare stood. All the while she had stood in the sidelines and I could tell from her expression that she hadn’t meant to speak out like that. I saw her mark; an ivory dish plate sparkling clean, it brought about memories from back in the castle.</p><p>She was the maid who lied to protect me when I burned off Blueblood’s tail.</p><p>&quot;Uhh, Shine....Bright?&quot; I asked a bit unsure.</p><p>&quot;You remember?&quot; she asked with eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>&quot;Phoenix poo,&quot; I said referring to her lie she told to cover my ass. &quot;Sorry, I didn’t recognize you back when you gave me the gem, what with the dragon and all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No I...I under-you were occupied with uhm... I’m just glad you remember.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That gem, it really helped a lot. In fact I’m pretty sure I’d be dead if you hadn’t brought it to me. Thank you so much for saving my life.&quot; The last sentence carried as much feeling of gratitude as I could muster.</p><p>&quot;Oh but I just....I was only, uhm.... You’re welcome,&quot; she replied shyly.</p><p>&quot;What are you doing in Ponyville?&quot; I asked before turning to Twilight. &quot;How’d she get the ge-ngg!&quot; Another flare of pain shot up my side forcing me to curl up.</p><p>&quot;I’ll go find the doctor,&quot; spoke Twilight before she trotted towards the room in a hurry only to stop momentarily to look around the room. &quot;Where’s Spike?&quot;</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Elsewhere...]=========</p></div><p>&quot;You ok there?&quot; asked a passing stallion. Spike looked up and recognized the brown pony as Dr.Whooves; the clock tower’s caretaker and operator.</p><p>“I’m fine,” replied the baby dragon sourly.</p><p>&quot;If you say so. Holler if you need anything.&quot; With that he trotted on down the road pulling along a wagon full of rubble and various broken furniture along with a large blue box. Like everypony else he was busy helping with the town's cleanup and recovery.</p><p>Spike continued watching the many ponies around him going about their work as he sat atop a piece of rubble next to a half demolished building. A few were still in shock at the whole event, especially those that lost their homes. You could tell who they were based on Whether they lingered out in the open staring at what remained of their property or busy trying to recover any valuable possessions that were still salvageable. There were also quite a number of new faces in town, most were were part of the relief group sent to help the town recover while a few came wanting to help when they heard what had happened.</p><p>It was different from when Spike lost control of his greed; spurred by uncontrolled desire he practically grew to near adulthood in less than a day. It took a long time, but eventually through hard work and a lot of apologies he was able amend for the damage he caused. However, back then everypony pretty much went straight back to their lives as if it were nothing more than an inconvenience.</p><p>Spike felt something brush against his legs and looking down he saw a large piece of paper snagged into one of his scales.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">EQUESTRIA DAILY</span></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">dragon Attacks Town Right Outside Canterlot</span></p></div><p><i>‘Where’s my front page special!?’</i> thought Spike with a scowl revealing his fangs. The sight of the newspaper sparked more anger and fouled his mood even further. He tried kicking the paper off but that only made it wrap around his leg. With a growl he huffed and blew out a stream of green flames incinerating the newspaper leaving only grey ash that drifted away in the wind.</p><p>Looking around Spike realized that his action had attracted some attention as ponies nearby stopped to stare at him. Considering what happened the night before, Spike decided it was probably best to be wary of his actions for a while. With a sigh he dropped to the ground and started making his way back to the hospital, hoping that something might cheer him up along the way.</p><p>Within a few steps he paused feeling irked at the thought of returning to the hospital. He stood there staring off into the distance wondering why he felt so sour when he heard a familiar chirping sound nearby.</p><p>“Peewee?” Turning back he followed the high pitched chirps around the corner and sure enough he saw the bright yellow and orange flames of the the baby phoenix next to a massive pile of rubble and debris. The town was using one of the piles as a temporary dump site to clean and gather trash that would be picked up later.</p><p>“What are you doing outside the library? How did you even get out?” asked Spike as he made his way to stand behind Peewee. Spike couldn’t help but raise a brow in confusion as he watched the phoenix busy clawing and pecking at ground, kicking up dirt and stone behind him like a dog.</p><p>“C’mon,” spoke Spike in a tired tone, “can’t leave you out here. Let’s go home.” Despite his tone Spike actually felt relieved that he had found a reason not to go to the hospital. He bent over and gently picked the phoenix up off the ground.</p><p>“Hey stop that!” he shouted as Peewee suddenly started scratching and biting on Spike’s claws. “What did I tell you about throwing a tantrum like that?”</p><p>Peewee ignored the dragon’s word however and kept trying his best to break free of Spike’s grip. All the while the bird kept staring at the mound of rubble where a small broken piece of a sapphire stuck out of the dirt. If anypony had seen the bluish glint, none would   had thought twice about it, it was nothing more than a broken piece of gem not worth salvaging. But to Peewee’s keen eagle-like eyes the slight glow was as clear as day. </p><p>There was still the faintest flicker of blue fire dancing inside.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Back at the hospital...]=========</p></div><p>“NGH!!” I clenched my teeth as a stabbing pain shot up from one of the ribs on my right side. I watched in pain as the hoof continued to lightly prod me while I lifted the thin garment up. I thought it was odd that they’d go to the effort of finding something for me to wear, after being stipped of my clothes I expected to be left in bed naked with only bandages to cover me. But looking down at my body I understood why. </p><p>My entire midsection was nearly covered with bruises ranging from mild to severe. It was difficult to find any patch of skin that didn’t show discoloration, either being red, blue or black. The largest mass was on the right side of my chest, where I was currently being prodded.</p><p>“Definitely fractured,” concluded the golden furred pony pulling back her hoof. Her mane and tail had two distinctive shades of blue making it look like toothpaste. She also wore a white shirt similar to the one’s used by the doctor’s in the hospital but slightly different.</p><p>Apparently this doctor, Dr. Mane Goodall, had been the one in charge of studying me; I should be grateful since someone is actually making an effort to learn about my physiology. Problem is, just like her mark suggests she’s not technically a doctor, but a veterinarian. I guess it does sort of make sense, after all doctors in this world meant they deal specifically in ponies. </p><p>But the idea of being taken to a vet.....</p><p>I could tell from her small smile that Twilight knew what I was thinking, and she was apparently enjoying it. After the doctor came everyone except Twilight left to deal with the aftermath of the attack. Rarity and Sweetie Belle went to check on the boutique while Shine Bright, who I’d been told would be staying with Twilight, was on her way back to the library. So only Twilight remained with me, waiting and watching with interest as she stood in the far wall.</p><p>I had been informed about Shine’s reason for being in Ponyville, solely me. Not quite sure how I should feel about having someone else watch over me twenty-four/seven. I could understand the incidents I’d been involved in, and accidently caused could make Celestia or Luna worry; but was not sure it warranted something like this.</p><p>I was beginning to suspect that it was Celestia who gave the order, could probably be her payback for that explosive letter. Though how this mare was supposed to be her revenge eluded me. Having to be chaperoned was a rather weak payback, I had expected something....well; more.</p><p>“How far can you twist your body?” asked the vet.</p><p>“Not much,” I answered while twisting my body to the limit before the pain became unbearable. “How bad is it?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, like I said it’s only fractured and not entirely broken through,” she replied in a light tone. “You probably fell on your side and landed wrong.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Or being squeezed like a lemon by a dragon.'</span></p><p>“I recommend you stay in bed till you recover but if you must move about I suggest keeping your movements slow and tight.”</p><p>“How did I not feel anything before?” Far as I could remember I didn’t felt pain this strong back when I fought Falnor. “I can’t even remember when it got fractured during the fight.”</p><p>“If I had to guess I’d say adrenaline had something to do with it,” the vet answered. “It’s been known to....wait what fight?”</p><p>I was about to mention the dragon but before I could utter a word I noticed Twilight shaking her head about in silence while her eyes looked directly at mine. The message was obvious but I couldn’t understand why. Still for now I decided to go along with what she wanted. </p><p>“I meant fright,” I answered going for the first lie that came to my head. “When the dragon came and I started running in fright.”</p><p>“Oh, well as I said it’s likely the adrenaline. Much like us your body releases adrenaline in extreme situations. Or it could simply be your brain blocking out sense of pain in order to better cope with the situation.”</p><p>“I see,” I replied ending the conversation there. I shot a glance at Twilight waiting for some explanation but she merely mouthed the word ‘later’ back.</p><p>“Alright, time to change those bandages,” I heard from motherly voice. I looked towards door to see nurse Redheart entering the room pushing a cart with two bottles on top. Both bottles looked identical to each other except for a symbol on the side that I didn’t recognize, a warning of sorts if I had to guess. As soon as she brought the cart in front of the bed, Redheart took the other bottle and popped it open with the edge of her hoof. Within seconds the entire room was filled with the same foul smell as the stuff under my bandages.</p><p>“The heck is that stuff anyways?” I tried my best to avoid using my nose to breathe.</p><p>“Crushed oterian flower petals. The other one contains haflax seeds.”  I looked at the nurse with a cocked brow. “The petals will helps with the pain and the seeds will promote healing,” Redheart explained as she took what looked like a mortar and pestle from under the cart. “But first we need to crush the seeds and mix them with the petals.”</p><p>“Each of the flowers have their own uses individually,” added Dr. Goodall. “They have beneficial effects when applied directly to the skin, though most ponies prefer not to since it requires one to be shaved before use. But that shouldn’t be a problem for you.”</p><p>“Right then, take that garment off and undo your bandages while I start grinding the seeds.” Immediately after the words came out of Redheart’s mouth I noticed Twilight jerk slightly while trying her best to stifle a laugh.</p><p>“No,” I answered in a flat tone as I grasped the tablecloth-turned-gown and held it tight.</p><p>“What’s wrong Rodney?” Twilight asked feigning ignorance with an innocent smile. Twilight continue to shiver and jerk still trying her best to keep a straight face.</p><p>I gave her a ‘you-know-damn-well-what’s-wrong’ look which only made it harder for her to control. After the flooding of Golden Oaks Library - the incident where I ended up naked out on the street in broad daylight - Twilight have been nagging to explain why it was so embarrassing for me. Eventually her stubbornness won out and during one of our theoretical sessions I explained why clothes were required in human society beyond physical needs.</p><p>“I’m not stripping,” I answered in a more defiant tone. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” asked Dr. Goodall confusedly with a slight look of worry, probably misunderstanding the problem with something health related.  </p><p>“Nothing. Here I’ll put the stuff on myself.” I was about to reach out and take the bottle of petals from Redheart when she slapped my hand away with a hoof.</p><p>“And how do you go about doing that with a fractured rib?” Redheart asked in a scolding tone before pouring a decent amount of seeds into the mortar. “This’ll be over the sooner you stop fussing about.”</p><p>“That’s what magic is for,” I argued before casting a levitation spell on both mortar and pestle causing the two to erupt in blue flames. “Here I’ll even grind them myself.</p><p>“Rodney stop!” I turned to Twilight just in time to see another pillow soar across the room knocking the mortar out of the air and out of my spell’s grip. “You can’t use magic on haflax seeds!”</p><p>Soon as the contents of the bowl spilled to the floor I witnessed the impossible. In a matter of seconds roots started growing right before my eyes, spreading out like tentacles as they burrowed into the floor. Small thin branches started growing upwards gaining roughly an inch every two seconds until they were roughly up to Twilight’s neck. Tiny pointy leaves started sprouting like wildfire from the many branches creating a massive group of bushes. From the size of just one of them I’d have guessed it would take at least a month for something like that to grow, yet they had grown in just a matter of minutes on top of a tiled floor right in before my very eyes.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/41e5192ce2f1a80aaaf2743596fbf4f39e490009?url=http%3A%2F%2Fl.rgbimg.com%2Fcache1nMb9d%2Fusers%2Fk%2Fkr%2Fkrayker%2F600%2Fmjv5NUE.jpg" /></p></div><p>“Holy.....” I was completely dumbstruck at what I had just witnessed. It was beautiful and awe inspiring, I had just caught the tiniest glimpse of creation.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'That...was pretty damn impressive.'</span></p><p>I turned and was just about to ask Twilight for an explanation when I noticed the look in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>“Twilight,” I called slowly, “what’s-”</p><p>“Don’t move!” Twilight shouted in a hushed tone. She, along with Redheart and Dr.Goodall, stood perfectly still staring at bushes with a fearful expression.</p><p>“Haflax belong to the same category of plant as Poison Joke,” Twilight began taking a step towards the door. “There are some plants that have a unique reaction when exposed to magic. Aside from growing like any other plant, haflax can also live off magic. But if they come into contact with condensed magic such as a spell for example....”</p><p>“It grows violently,” finished Dr. Goodall in a whisper.</p><p>“And the ‘not moving part’?” I asked warily. </p><p>“Haflax has a defense mechanism to ward off threats.” Twilight started sliding her hooves inch by inch as she neared the door. “Not only does it absorb the ambient magic around but it also detects the flow. Think of it like air, if anything nearby moves too fast or causes a disturbance it’ll-”</p><p>“Hey monkey you in there!!” Before any of us could react the door suddenly swung violently open to reveal a bronze pegasus standing in the doorway with his right hoof pointed forward.</p><p>“Look what I sneaked in!” he shouted while trotting into the room without a care in the world. His right wing was encased in what looked like a cast while the other held a large, unlabeled, half-empty bottle of an unknown liquid.</p><p>With that stupid smile on his face it was easy to figure out what was in that bottle.</p><p>“Now that ain’t fair,” he said finally noticing the plantation so very much out of place in front of him. “How does your room have a garden and mine don’t?”</p><p>I turned my gaze back at the plants to see them all vibrate and shiver madly until suddenly every leaf started to split right down the middle to reveal something brown and sharp. What had once been a plant with beautiful shades of green, turned to a dark menacing brown with sharp pointed thorns aimed in every direction.</p><p>“Buck,” was all Dr.Goodall could say before all hell broke loose.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>Like machine guns, every bush opened fire on the room, a hail of thorns flew in every direction, some even impacting hard enough to embed themselves in the wall. Twilight disappeared behind a fort of pillows while nurse Redheart and Dr. Goodall made a run for the door galloping right past the drunk pegasus. The funniest thing was how Bronze simply ignored the hail of thorns, tilted his head back, and started gulping in the contents of the bottle as if everything was fine while thorns bounced off his fur. </p><p>As for me, well....</p><p>Out of pure reflex I cast a levitation field in the air between me and the plants creating a wall of fire that captured the thorns in midair. The thorns floated in front of me like the bullets from that one scene in The Matrix, thickening as more and more got caught in the spell.</p><p>“Rodney you idiot!!” Twilight shouted with her head sticking out of her wall of pillows.</p><p>“Don’t worry I didn’t touch the plant,” I assured her. “I only caught the thorns.”</p><p>“The thorns have seeds inside them!!!” I quickly looked back at the floating wall of thorns in front of me. There were hundreds of them and every single one had cracked open and small brown roots were starting to grow out of each one.</p><p>What was once a wall of thorns a second ago, had turned into a wall of vines and roots spreading in every direction.</p><p>“Well shit....”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sometime ago, outside...]=========</p></div><p>“The train will be arriving with more relief supplies around noon tomorrow,” continued the unicorn mare as she trotted on with several pages of reports floating in front of her.</p><p>“What of the construction crews?”</p><p>“A few are already here Your Highness, but the majority won’t arrive for several days.” The mare paused her report in order to speed up and trot alongside the white alicorn. Aside from the mare, Celestia was also accompanied by two guards following along from behind. “Those that arrived had begun cleaning and removing debris as well as preparing the town for reconstruction. According to the latest report the damage was more than what we expected, especially those in Highwind street.”</p><p>“And housing?”</p><p>“Nearly all of the residents that have lost their homes in the attack are living with either friends or relatives. The rest are currently living in temporary tent camps in the apple farm nearby, the family that owns it has opened the entire property for aid.”</p><p>Celestia couldn’t help but smile at that, friends or perhaps even strangers were ready to help and open their homes to the unfortunate. Even more so in a small town like this where everypony was likely acquainted with one another.</p><p>“How goes the press? How have the citizens reacted to the news?”</p><p>“As expected, most are unsure if the treaty still holds. They fear the drakes are attacking again, I have reports that some have already left the major cities. I highly suggest a public address to calm the situation as soon as possible before it escalates.”</p><p>“I will in due time, for now this town requires my attention.” Celestia could hear the papers shuffle about in the air beside her as the mare brought more out of her saddlebag.</p><p>“There is another problem Your Highness, there are reporters in town asking question regarding the attack.”</p><p>“Are they bothering the townsfolk?” Celestia was well aware how competitive these journalists could be at times, ravenous for a juicy story.</p><p>“Not so much as to be a concern at the moment. However, I overheard one interview on my way that caught my attention. The resident apparently witnessed a great explosion during the attack. What’s interesting is how she described the flames.”</p><p>“They were blue.” Celestia let out a sigh as she stopped in her tracks, she knew this had been bound to happen but didn’t expect it to come so soon.</p><p>Rodney’s existence would soon be known to the mass public, likely to the neighbouring nations as well. </p><p>Celestia had taken this matter into consideration when she allowed the human to reside in Ponyville. Despite the wild events that had befallen the town in the recent past, it was still a small town that nopony really payed any attention to. Aside from the production of zap apples, Ponyville was a small as a rural town could get.</p><p>She knew the townsfolk weren’t the type to report the strange unknown creature to journalists for several reasons. One; he came into town in a royal carriage, which would make everypony assume that the government knew about him already. Second; his arrival had been public and in broad daylight giving the impression that his existence was nothing secretive; most, if not all, would simply believe he was some exotic creature from the far fringes of the known world. </p><p>The idea was simple, allow Rodney to live amongst the populace for a certain amount of time without his existence being public knowledge to all of Equestria; this would accomplish two things. First it would eliminate some of the surprise factor, meaning that his existence would have already become public knowledge. Even if it was only to the residents of Ponyville.</p><p>Second, and most importantly; it would help everypony to accept his existence. Hearing that he’d been living amongst ponies all this time would immediately give him a less threatening reputation. Questions such as “Is he dangerous?” wouldn’t need to be addressed, the fact that he had lived amongst ponied for some time would answer that question.</p><p>But with the dragon attack bringing so much attention to the town, Rodney’s existence would no doubt be discovered ahead of time. Tomorrow's newspaper would likely mention him in some way, it wouldn’t be surprising if it even included a picture of him. She could only hope the time he’d lived there long enough to have the effect she wished.</p><p>Something she’d have to discuss with him.</p><p>“What would you like me to do?” asked the mare.</p><p>“Nothing,” answered Celestia after a pause. “It would have happened sooner or later. But make sure his involvement with the town’s defense is known.”</p><p><i>‘At least that way he’ll be seen in a more positive light,’</i> thought Celestia as she continued on her way.</p><p>Celestia soon spotted her destination when Ponyville Hospital came into view. For a small town like Ponyville, a medical building of that size was adequate. It served as a single stop for everything from birth care to life threatening injuries and illness. Celestia doubted it even had a full staff during normal days, but with the additional doctors and nurses from Canterlot the entire building was buzzing with activity.</p><p>“Where is the human now?” Celestia asked as she neared the front door.</p><p>“Uhhh,” mumbled the mare trying to remember that particular detail. “I believe the nurse mentioned he was in room two-”</p><p>Before the mare could utter another word, they heard the loud sound of breaking glass from somewhere to the right. Celestia turned just in time to witness something green suddenly explode from one of the large windows, shattering it and sending broken glass raining down on the lawn. But what caught her attention was the flying hospital bed that flew out from the window being pushed it out with considerable force by the green mass. Rather than tumbling over, the bed had fortunately managed to land on it’s legs several meters away from the building, revealing the current occupant. </p><p>The human. </p><p>He wore what looked like a tablecloth along with bandages that wrapped around him underneath. Additionally he was covered in tiny leaves and thorns as if he had fallen through several tree-sized rose bushes. </p><p>“Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh....” groaned the human in a weak voice, laying on the bed with his eyes closed.</p><p>The way it all happened out of the blue caused the alicorn to pause and blink several times as she tried to comprehend what had just happened. It was at that point that she heard Twilight’s muffled and panicked voice shouting from within the mass of green.</p><p>“RODNEY!!”</p><p>“Never mind,” sighed Celestia just as several hospital staff rushed out to see what had just occurred.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 36 - Well that escalated quickly<br/>Edited by Hollyhock</p><hr/><p>Luna sat on the throne in silence gazing at the large double doors at the end of the hall. She looked outside to the vast view of lands below, the bright midday sun hung in the sky, reminding Luna of how late it was and she had to suppress an urge to yawn. With Celestia overseeing Ponyville, it fell to Luna to take her place.</p><p>News of the Professor and the gryphon's sudden appearance in the hangar were immediately relayed to the alicorn. Obviously they must have teleported back. Luna waited expectantly on the throne, hoping that the distinguished Professor could offer some explanation to the whole situation.</p><p>So far, neither Luna nor Celestia had learned much about the attack. Despite Luna's insistence Celestia still chose to forfeit custody of the dragon to Equestria’s dragon community. Even in his current state of mind there might still be a chance they could glean some information out of him. Luna did not share Celestia's trust for the so called reformed drakes. Secretly she suspected this attack had been orchestrated in some way and part of a greater conspiracy.</p><p>Then again, she had been absent from the world for a thousand years. To say that she had an outdated perspective of the world would have been the understatement of the century.</p><p>The double doors swung open with a slight creaking noise revealing an old gray unicorn with a ghost white horn. It was clear that he must’ve teleported directly from the Everfree. His hooves were still covered with dirt while leaves stuck to his mane and fur.</p><p>“Inquest, welcome back. It is good to see you return safe,” greeted Luna. “Where is your partner, Crea?” she asked noticing the gryphon’s absence.</p><p>“She’s resting in the gardens. Always did prefer nature over a mattress.” Inquest gazed about the room. “Will Celestia be joining us?” he asked. A few of the guards flinched ever so slightly hearing the stallion address the princess so casually.</p><p>“No she will not, Celestia is currently overseeing the recovery of Ponyville. You are aware of recent events?”</p><br/><p>“I am. In fact, that attack might have been my doing.” Almost immediately the temperature fell to near freezing levels as Luna’s eyes started to glow as white as the moon.</p><p>“Everypony out,” ordered Luna. Every guard in the room started marching out in an orderly fashion, none of them wanted anything to do with Luna’s wrath.</p><p>“Explain yourself.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[At Ponyville hospital.....]=========</p></div><p>“There, all done.” Redheart's gaze lingered up and down scrutinizing her work a second time. “Now just stay in bed and rest.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am,” I responded quickly, in a respectful tone.</p><p>After the incident with the plant, I had seen a side of Redheart I never cared to see again. Having one of her patients - namely me - thrown out the second story window, ruining a perfectly good room, and seeing Bronze blatantly drinking booze drove the head nurse completely mad. Within seconds of the incident she took control of the situation like a dictator, ordering and delegating doctors and nurses back to their patients just like that. She even ordered the two royal guards escorting Celestia to lift me, along with the bed, to a different room, and they immediately obeyed without a question.</p><p>It was frightening how similar she was to my mother at that moment. Heck she even told Celestia to wait in the hall until everything had been sorted out. So despite my insecurities and discomfort, I pretty much allowed her to treat me in anyway she saw fit. Naked and all. It was clear that the hospital was her domain, and she ruled it with an iron hoof.</p><p>At least there was a bright side to that, thanks to her I might just get the rest I needed. I was immediately barred off from all forms of visits, along with Bronze, though in his case it was probably to keep a closer eye on him. Which was probably why she parred the both of us in the same room, which would fortunately offer some company should I get bored.</p><p>“And you!” Redheart suddenly shouted glaring at Bronze. “If I find anymore contraband I’ll cut off the painkillers. Understood?” Bronze merely replied by rolling his eyes from across the room while he lay on his own bed. “Is. That. Understood?” Redheart asked again in a more threatening tone.</p><br/><p>“Yeah yeah,” grumbled Bronze irritably. With that Redheart turned and trotted towards a cart laden with a multitude of bottles, each a different brand of alcohol she found hidden in Bronze’s room.</p><p>I’m not sure how he did it without flying, but somehow Bronze managed to sneak out and smuggle in not one, not two, nor three, but eight large bottles of booze. Without anyone noticing. I kept wondering how he even managed to physically carry that many bottles. Even if he'd had the use of both wings.</p><p>“I’m sorry about the room,” I apologized again.</p><p>“Like I said before; you didn’t know. Can’t rightly blame anypony for ignorance. But if you want to make up for it, just rest and get healed up.”</p><p>“I will. No more shenanigans, I promise.”</p><p>“Good, and make sure he does the same,” she replied, gesturing towards the pegasus with her eyes. With that Redheart pushed the cart towards the open door, pausing the moment she reached the hallway. “I can’t deny Your Majesty’s wish but please keep it brief. They both need their rest.”</p><p>“Of course,” replied a elegant and motherly voice. As Redheart disappeared around the corner with the cart, Celestia stepped into view and trotted in while her two royal guards stayed outside. As usual her rainbow mane swayed in the air despite any wind, creating an air of grace and elegance that would have made Rarity jealous. </p><p>“How are you faring Rodney?”</p><p>“I’ll live. Considering what happened I should count myself lucky that I even made it out alive.” I turned and pointed at Bronze and nodded. “Bronze and the guards protecting the town got it worse, I think.”</p><p>“Yup, I did,” added Bronze casually. I merely chuckled at his bluntness, I guess it didn't really matter who he was talking to.</p><p>“Don’t worry, no one from the squad lost their life and only a few will require extensive treatment. Oh, and of course I must thank Lieutenant Sky for his efforts as well.”</p><p>Both my brows rose in surprise, “Lieutenant?”</p><p>“Ah shucks, you remember me?” Bronze asked somewhat shyly.</p><p>“You made quite an impression before you transferred. I missed your crassness, it was fresh.”</p><p>“How’s that colt doing? Last I heard he was still under review.”</p><p>“He’s settling in wonderfully. You were right about him; the position of Captain suits Shining Armor perfectly.”</p><p>“Ha! Knew that kid had it in him,” shouted Bronze proudly.</p><p>“Whoa hold on now,” I interrupted. “You’re a lieutenant?”</p><p>“Was,” he corrected. “A long time ago. I’ll tell you about it later if I feel like it.” He turned to Celestia. “Now, I doubt Her Majesty came all the way here for my sake.” With a slight grunt, Bronze got off the bed and started trotting towards the door. “I’ll let you two have the room. It was good seeing you again Princess.”</p><p>“Same to you Bronze Sky,” replied Celestia before the pegasus exited the room.</p><p>“So.....what happened?” I asked once we were alone. Though the question was vague, Celestia seemed to understand what I meant.</p><p>“Well, the moment Luna heard of the attack, she-”</p><p>“Not that,” I interrupted. “I can pretty much guess what happened. I want to know what happened after it all. Like where’s Falnor now?”</p><p>“You know him?”</p><p>“He was polite enough to introduce himself before trying to kill me,” I explained sarcastically.</p><p>“He is no longer in our custody.”</p><p>“Dafuq does that mean?”  </p><p>“Be calm Rodney, I-”</p><p>“Screw that! He tried to kill me!!” I shouted. “What, did you just let him go!?”</p><p>“Rodney!!” This was the first time I had actually heard her yell like that, it reminded me exactly who it was I was talking to.</p><p>“I’m...sorry Your Highness. I...”</p><p>“I understand. Now, as I was saying. Falnor is no longer in our custody. We returned him to Equestria’s dragon clan for treatment. It appears that he has....lost part of his mind.”</p><p>“There’s a dragon clan here!?” I asked frightened.</p><p>“It refers to all the dragons that reside in Equestria,” she explained. “They are not an unruly sort. Did you believe I would allow such dangerous creatures to reside so close to my beloved ponies?”</p><p>“I....I guess there’s a lot about Equestria that I don’t know.” I let out a sigh. “You said he was crazy?”</p><p>“Not entirely no. But it was clear that we could not question him. Our understanding of dragons and their physiology is limited, for that I decided it would be best for his own kind to keep him.”</p><p>I became silent for a moment letting it all sink in. A sense of relief washed over me after knowing that the dragon was far away from ponyville. It had been bugging me ever since I woke up, I kept imagining him suddenly showing up out of nowhere to finish the job. Now I could finally relax and unwind knowing that threat was far away.</p><p>“I heard you played a pivotal role in saving Ponyville from him,” Celestia continued moving the conversation on.</p><p>“I’m not sure about ‘pivotal’,” I replied with a chuckle. Looking back I realized how ridiculous it all was; me fighting against a dragon. “I actually don’t remember much. There was a lot of running around and I was mostly just reacting to the situation.”</p><p>“Oh my, is this humility I hear?” she asked teasingly. Probably trying to lighten up the mood for my sake.</p><p>“Eh,” I replied with a shrug, “it is what it is.”</p><p>“But why did you risk yourself like that? It’s commendable for sure, but the reasonable and logical choice would have been to join with the evacuation.”</p><p>“If Falnor had wanted to destroy the town then yeah; that would have been the logical choice. But there was no way of knowing that, had he chased there was no way we’d outrun it.” I took a deep breath as more memories filtered through my mind. “I’ve seen what he can do up close and considering it was an open field from Ponyville straight to Canterlot; we’d have been easy pickings. At least that’s how I saw it.”</p><p>“So through all the turmoil and danger around, you were able to calculate all those factors and come up with that conclusion? To leap headfirst into the fray against a dragon?” she asked genuinely surprised. “Whether it was bravery, insanity or recklessness, it seems I have underestimated your character.”</p><p>“Probably all three,” I replied with a laugh that quickly died down. Out of nowhere, the memory of that fateful decision came to me. I remembered Sweetie Belle stopping me just before I was about to abandon them all for my own sake. “And I doubt my character deserves any praise.”</p><p>“Oh?” Celestia looked at me with a raised brow. “Did you not save lives by confronting the dragon? I believe the bravery of that act alone deserves praise.”</p><p>“Because I wanted to run!” I clamped my mouth shut immediately after but it was too late. It was clear to anyone that I hadn't intended to blurt that out; but it was too late now. I looked away and before continuing. “You have no idea how close I was to just leaving everyone. And that’s not even the worst part.”</p><p>“Meaning?” I let out a long sigh and looked down at my hands.</p><p>“I’ve never been so afraid in my life,” I continued, “I wasn’t just going to run, I was ready to sacrifice them all. Soon as everyone made a run for Canterlot I was going to use them as a decoy and save myself.” There was an uncomfortable silence after that felt like it lasted several minutes.</p><p>“But you didn’t,” she suddenly spoke in a firm yet reassuring tone. “Rodney I don’t blame you for wanting to protect your life, any living creature has that innate instinct for self preservation. Do not be ashamed of those thoughts, they do not define who you are. Because in the end, despite your fears you chose differently.” I suddenly saw a white hoof reach for me, tilting my chin up and forcing me to gaze at the alicorn.</p><p>“You showed bravery and strength that few posses. Guilt should be the last thing that troubles you. Enjoy in the moment of life that you fought for and be proud of what you have done. Of the lives and future you’ve preserved including your own.”</p><p>“I....thanks,” I replied with a blank face, not knowing what to properly say. I didn’t expect to hear such a compliment from her. Me? Strength and bravery?</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Just take the compliment.'</span></p><p>“If you don’t mind me asking, how did you manage to survive the encounter?” she asked hesitantly. Probably thought the whole thing left me with a trauma or something.</p><p>It did.</p><p>“Dumb luck,” I answered with a huff. “The whole plan was simply to distract him and buy as much time as I could. Hit and run tactic, be as annoying as possible. But in the end I was just frantically running around with no idea as to what I should do.” I tried to recount all that happened and I noticed there were gaps in my memory where events didn’t connect properly. Now I understood why major accident victims always claimed not remembering anything, that it all happened too fast and what-not.</p><p>“The only reason I survived was because I had help. Falnor managed to catch me and I was trapped in his grip. That, by all accounts, should have been the end had help not arrived.” I looked and nodded towards the empty bed in the opposite wall. “Bronze came flying in out of nowhere and saved my hide.” I suddenly started to chuckle as a thought began to form. “Why would he risk himself like that? I mean yeah, he may have owed me but so far we’re just acquaintances. And it’ not just him either; Twilight and Shine tagged along and risked their lives as well.”</p><p>“Are such notions unusual to your kind?”</p><p>“No, that’s not what I meant. We have our heroes, and there are plenty of individuals that have put their life in danger for someone else. Even for a complete stranger.”</p><p>“But not for you,” Celestia spoke in an understanding tone. “This is a first for you.”</p><p>“Yeah....it is.” I scratched my eyes as my emotions suddenly went haywire. “Uhm, look, this is getting too personal for my taste,” I spoke with a heavy sigh, “let’s talk about something else alright.”</p><p>“Very well, let’s move on. There is another matter I wish to discuss.” I watched as Celestia levitated a massive pillow which was more like a sofa, from the corner of the room to her side. She laid atop it sideways with the same regal air and elegance of royalty that she always showed.</p><p>“I’ll be blunt,” she began after clearing her throat, “your existence will soon be public knowledge.” The room fell silent for a moment as I tried to comprehend what she just said.</p><p>“I’m sorry.....what?” I guess my expression must’ve showed how confused I was seeing as Celestia suddenly started laughing.</p><p>“I’m sorry, that was rude of me. I suppose that was too blunt. Let me explain; other than the residents of this town and the castle staff, nopony is aware of your existence. Though I have not restricted the media in any way, neither have I offered them or any other party knowledge regarding you. Is it not strange that you being in Ponyville never roused any interest?”</p><p>“I did but...I always thought you told them of me before I arrived.”</p><p>“True. But is it not strange that a creature from another world never made it to any article or news media?”</p><p>“Well, now that you mention it....” As I recalled the early days when I first arrived in Ponyville, there was certainly no uproar of any kind. I might not have read the newspaper daily, or even frequently, but if I was mentioned in someway, then someone would have told me about it. especially Twilight and Rarity.</p><p>“Other than myself, Luna and a selected few; nopony knows you came from another world. Even the mayor was given a very basic knowledge about you, everything except your origin and unique ability.”</p><p>“I suppose there’s a reason for all this secrecy?”</p><p>“Of course, and you’ll soon discover them.” I raised a brow and waited for her to continue. “Due to the attack many reporters have flocked into town and logically a majority of the ponies in town will be interviewed.”</p><p>“And eventually they’ll mention me.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'No doubt more than a few must’ve seen the fight. And even if they didn’t, they would have seen and heard that massive explosion. Not to mention the fires were blue.'</span></p><p><i>’Yeah alright I get it.'</i></p><p>“Has’, Celestia corrected. “Be prepared Rodney, somepony from the media will approach you before the end of today.”</p><p>“I guess this will stir things up a little,” I jokingly add to ease the air.</p><p>“More than a little.”</p><p>“And here I thought I was finally getting some peace and quiet. So now what?” I asked throwing both arms to the side, albeit carefully as to not cause pain to my damaged body. “Are you going to fly me back to the castle?”</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>“It’s what I would do. Makes it easier to control the situation.”</p><p>“That’s true, it would. But I’ll leave the choice to you.”</p><p>“You’re letting me stay? What’s the deal?” I asked warily.</p><p>“No deals, no strings. You may stay if you wish, though the castle could be your home should you choose.”</p><p>“No thanks,” I immediately replied. “I’m staying. That place is way too strict for my taste, I’ll likely be more of a freeloader there sitting with my thumb up my ass. It’s a human saying,” I quickly added before Celestia could ask. “Whatever these reporters are gonna bring, I doubt it'll be worth leaving town.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Not to mention we’ll have to deal with Blueblood.'</span> The thought of Blueblood reminded me of something else. Or to be more accurate, a particular pony.</p><p>“So....uh, what’s the deal with Shine Bright? I was told that you sent her to keep an eye on me but isn’t Twilight doing that already? Considering it’s her and how much she admires you; I’d wager you get a detailed report on me almost everyday.”</p><p>“Something like that. Does this bother you?”</p><p>“The reports? A bit, at the beginning. But I got over it. I knew you - and especially not Luna - would be willing to let me live freely like this without someone to monitor me. Don’t worry, I don’t blame you. Alien from a different world and all that. But Shine? No offense but I don’t see how she is supposed to be better than Twilight.”</p><p>“She isn't supposed to replace Twilight,” replied Celestia with a smile. “I merely sent her as insurance should my student find herself too occupied.”</p><p>That smile. That was the same trolling smile she gave me on the landing pad just before I departed from the castle.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">'Oh, she is definitely planning something.'</span></p><p>“What are you planning?” I asked suspiciously. I knew she wouldn’t let that exploding letter pass by, this had to be some kind of payback.</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re implying,” she answered innocently. “But I assure you, my intentions are noble.” Celestia’s eyes bore into mine. Her smile lingered, making my spine shiver.</p><p><i>‘Bullshit.’</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Meanwhile, elsewhere...]=========</p></div><p>“Is it really a monkey!? There are no known species capable of-umf!” shouted one stallion from the back before a mare forcefully pushed herself in front of him.</p><p>“Is it safe!?” she screamed over the clamour. “Have you suffered any infection or sickness!?”</p><p>“Where is it now!?” bellowed another pony from somewhere far back.</p><p>“There are ponies claiming to witness a massive blue explosion during the attack!”</p><p>“Where is it now!?”</p><p>Rarity could only lay on her victorian couch in silence inside her home as the shouts and questions came endlessly. She tried her best to block out all the noise while massaging both sides of her head, hoping to ward off the growing headache.</p><p>It all happened too fast.</p><p>After returning from the hospital and finding their home untouched by the attack, the only real danger was trying to convince Opal to come out from a closet. Both sisters had a quick bite to eat and then began cleaning the house. It consisted of about an hour or two of uneventful work, other than Sweetie Belle’s occasional mishaps. Eventually, things were relatively back where they should. After leaving Sweetie Belle in charge of watching the house and Opal (which might not have been the wisest of decisions,) Rarity left the boutique in order to check on the others.</p><p>Twilight of course was safe, so was Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, seeing as their homes were relatively far from Ponyville. But as for Pinkie Pie, the spa sisters, the Cakes and everypony else she was closely acquainted with; they were all in town when the dragon attacked. To check on them all would mean a trip over the entire town.</p><p>It was only after she met the twins and left the spa that the first newspony appeared.</p><p>Like everypony else in town, Rarity was aware of the media’s presence in Ponyville. But despite the temptation to be in the spotlight, she never approached them. Not only was it unladylike but neither was it the kind of attention she desired. Still, she could at the least show how resilient the residents of Ponyville were.</p><p>That’s when it all went downhill.</p><p>Another newspony appeared behind the first, followed by a third and a fourth from a different corner. Rarity knew something was wrong the moment their eyes froze on her. It logically meant they were looking for her. Living up to their competitive reputations, all four newsponies suddenly galloped towards her without warning.</p><p>Confused and taken by surprise, Rarity bolted away from the stampeding newsponies that were shouting questions at her.</p><p>“Excuse me Miss Rarity! Straight Ink from Tall Tale Times! Could you please answer a few questions!?”</p><p>“Highlink from Equestria Daily! Could you spare moment?!”</p><p>&quot;We heard your pet saved the town from the dragon!!&quot;</p><p><i>'Pet?'</i> It hardly took a second for an image of a human to pop in her mind.</p><p>&quot;Rodney,&quot; she grumbled. Rarity mentally berated herself for not realizing this, of course he would attract attention.</p><p>Between leaving the spa and reaching the boutique, the number of reporters had nearly tripled. Her only solace was being inside her home, only a very rare few would dare to publicly break in. Unicorns tried levitating their cameras while pegasi carried theirs to the air, all hoping to get a shot of Rodney no doubt. Fortunately that meant they weren’t aware of his whereabouts; unfortunately that also meant they were not going to leave anytime soon.</p><p>She was now trapped inside her own home, tired and covered in sweat, with no other option but to wait out the storm. Obviously she could just tell them where Rodney was and send them away, but that would be inconsiderate and heartless. Especially to somepony - or someone as he prefers to say - who risked his life for the town. The least she could do was distract these ponies for as long as possible, giving Rodney his much needed rest.</p><p>“Are they all looking for Rodney?” asked Sweetie Belle as she peered through a closed curtain. Almost instantly her eyes were assaulted by several bright flashes leaving her temporarily blind as she wobbled with eyes disoriented.</p><p>“I’m afraid so darling,” replied Rarity with a heavy, tired sigh. “I suppose he would attract something like this. But why now and not before?” she wondered.</p><p>“Does this mean I can’t go see Scootaloo and Applebloom?” the filly asked slightly louder then the muffled shouts from outside.</p><p>“I’m afraid not Sweetie Belle. We’ll just have to wait until everypony leaves.” Rarity looked disapprovingly towards the loudest group outside the front door. “This is not how anypony should treat a lady!” she screamed irritably which only made the reporters shout louder and in greater frequency.</p><p>Rarity sank deeper into her red mattress and continued massaging her head, which unfortunately was failing to alleviate her headache.</p><p>“Rarity!!” somepony shouted, followed by loud heavy knocking.</p><p>It took several more yells before Rarity finally noticed the familiar voice over the clamour, longer to realize that the knocking was coming from somewhere above rather than the front door.</p><p>“Isn’t that Rainbow Dash?” asked Sweetie Belle gazing up at the ceiling.</p><p>“Hey back off buddy or I’ll buck that camera to your face!!” shouted the voice angrily.</p><p>“I believe it is,” Rarity answered with a smile. “Stay here Sweetie Belle.” Following the commotion up the stairs, Rarity quickly spotted the cyan pegasus hovering in front of a window in her bedroom. Behind her hovered several other pegasi, each with cameras aimed at her and the window. The moment they spotted Rarity approach all the cameras started flashing over and over again.</p><p>“Hey watch where you point that thing!” shouted Rainbow Dash as she tried to shield her eyes with a hoof.</p><p>With her eyes closed Rarity reached out with her magic and pulled the window open just enough for one pegasi to slip through.</p><p>“Quickly now!” Rarity bode. Soon as Rainbow Dash squeezed through Rarity immediately slammed the window shut, locked it, and closed the curtains on every window.</p><p>“So,” sighed Rainbow exhaustively as she slumped to the floor with her wings spread to the side. &quot;Everything alright?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fairly well. Though I could do without the constant yelling outside. And you? Why the visit? Not that I don't appreciate it of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just going around town checking up on everypony,&quot; Rainbow answered as she pushed herself back up on all four.</p><p>Hearing this, Rarity's expression lit up. &quot;You are!? How is everypony? I meant to meet the others but...&quot; Rarity gazed towards the window.</p><p>&quot;Yeah that would be a problem. Well, Pinkie's fine and back to her usual self. I heard she carried the twins by herself to the edge of town. The Cakes left the day before, something about a getting hired for a festival somewhere.&quot; Rainbow chuckled. &quot;I bet she’s like a manticore guarding her cubs. Could've taken that dragon out by herself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No doubt,&quot; agreed Rarity jokingly. &quot;And the others?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fluttershy's locked herself up at home,” Rainbow answered in a worried tone. “Tried calling her out but she's not listening.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh dear, she must've been terrified of the whole thing. Especially with her fear of dragons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but we sure could've used her Stare. Would have made things soooo much easier. Anyways I thought it best to give her some time to calm down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's probably best. I'll be sure to keep her company. A nice long day of pampering at the spa should do the trick.&quot;</p><p>Rainbow scoffed that notion with a flap of her wing. &quot;That's your answer for everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's because it works,&quot; Rarity replied a matter of factly. &quot;What about Applejack?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She's fine but busy. The Apples opened up the farm for anypony who lost their homes. You should she it, tents everywhere. A lot of ponies got their homes wrecked. More than you'd expect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah don't worry about it. Princess Celestia's got this covered. I heard she'll fix up the town out of her own pocket.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean the government's budget.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I’m pretty sure I heard it’s her own savings or something.&quot; Rarity looked unsure whether to believe her or not. &quot;Hey it kinda makes sense; imagine how many bits you can save up over thousands of years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wasn't aware she was taking payment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Neither did I. But hey, everypony have something they want to buy from time to time. Even Celestia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's understandable. Heaven knows I can't live through the eons without a new dress or two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or a thousand,&quot; jibbed Rainbow. &quot;You probably need a whole castle as your personal closet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The idea is certainly enthralling.&quot; The two shared a few seconds of laughter, momentarily forgetting the disturbance outside.</p><p>Momentarily.</p><p>&quot;Don’t worry, they’ll tire out sooner or later. Hopefully lose their voices too,&quot; consoled Rainbow Dash. “Are they really all here for Rodney? Bet he’d enjoy the attention.”</p><p>“Doubtful. Trust me, nothing good comes from this sort of fame. He’ll be treated as an animal. They even asked if he was my pet.”</p><p>“Wait. He’s not?” Rarity looked at the pegasus disapprovingly. “I’m kidding,” Rainbow quickly added. “Where is he anyway? Downstairs?”</p><p>“You didn’t know? He was taken to the hospital for treatment and is currently staying there for the foreseeable future,” informed Rarity.</p><p>“Is that where Twilight’s at? Haven’t been able to find her so far.”</p><p>“Last time I saw I her, yes. She was keeping him company.”</p><p>“Well then it’s simple.” Rainbow trotted towards the window in a casual manner.</p><p>“Rainbow Dash?” Rarity asked suspiciously. “What are you-”</p><p>Without warning Rainbow undid the lock and pushed the window wide open. “Hey everypony!! He’s at the hospital!!” Everything suddenly fell silent for several seconds as Rarity and the newsponies froze.</p><p>“Well?” continued Rainbow. “Get out of here!!” That triggered a sudden tremor that shook the boutique as every newspony started galloping and shoving each other racing towards Ponyville Hospital.</p><p>“There, problem gone.” Rainbow casually reached and closed the window with a wing before turning around. Only to notice Rarity glaring at her angrily. “What?”</p><p>Rarity could only facehoof and hope for the best.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sometime later...]=========</p></div><p>“Well that escalated quickly,” I commented while gazing out the window. With only a dust cloud in the distance as a warning, I saw a large group of ponies stampeding their way towards the hospital. I had expected them to arrive one at a time, nothing like that.</p><p>While the earth ponies and unicorns tried to catch up, the pegasi reached the hospital first with their clear advantage. They swarmed the windows like flies holding what looked like cameras tied around their necks. I noticed small gems socketed above each camera before they all started flashing and blinding me.</p><p>Worse; seeing Celestia present with me sent them into a sort of fervor. They started screaming altogether making it difficult to discern what any of them are saying. Though it sounded like questions if I had to guess. Rather offensive ones from the small bits and pieces I could make out.</p><p>“What now!?” I yelled just as the two guards waiting outside the room suddenly barged in.</p><p>Instead of answering Celestia simply raised a wing to halt the guards in place while her horn began to glow. I could ‘feel’ the buildup of magic from it and tried as I might it was impossible to ignore the ‘heat’ radiating from her. She was like a box containing the sun and her gathering magic was like poking a needle into that box. I only ‘felt’ an extremely tiny fraction of what she held inside but it was enough to overwhelm my ‘Sense’.</p><p>Without any warning the ‘heat’ suddenly disappeared along with the constant yelling and screaming from outside. I noticed a white shimmer covering the walls, floor and ceiling like a sort of gel.</p><p>“That should suffice,” spoke Celestia as she regarded her work. The curtains too were now closed cutting of the flashes and dimming the room considerably. With a look from Celestia the two guards turned around and returned to their position outside where they simply passed through the shimmer without any resistance.</p><p>“This is impressive.”</p><p>“I would hardly call their actions as ‘impressive’,” replied Celestia thinking I was talking about the ponies outside.</p><p>“No not them,” I corrected. “I meant this,” I gestured with an arcing wave at Celestia’s spell.</p><p>“Why thank you, though it’s nothing worth bragging. It’s far more simple than it looks. At least once you’ve figured out the trick.”</p><p>“Care to share that trick with me?” I asked with a smile. I was already thinking of wrapping it around myself during one of Twilight’s lengthy lectures.</p><p>“I doubt my student would appreciate it if I did,” she replied with a knowing look.</p><p>“Oh wow, was it that obvious?”</p><p>“Very. But back to our earlier discussion. Are you certain it’s more than before?”</p><p>“What about them?” I gazed towards the window, though I could no longer hear the ponies outside I could still make out their shadows dancing madly about. “I assume they can’t hear us?”</p><p>“Yes, the spell works both ways so just ignore them. Now answer the question.”</p><p>“Positive. It’s definitely more. Roughly twice as much as I can normally hold.” I closed my eyes and concentrated on my ‘Sense’, only this time I focused it inwards to myself. Sure enough I could feel the magic inside my gut burning like a furnace. It was much larger than I’d ever been able to hold without having to suffer the headaches. My mind was clear and pain free at the moment.</p><p>“And you noticed this when?”</p><p>“After that devil plant tried to kill me,” I answered irritably. The cuts I got from the thorns and branches still itch from time to time and the bandages prevented me from scratching them properly. “Back during the attack, after Princess Squash-A-Nut showed up I-”</p><p>“Please stop referring to my sister in those manners,” begged Celestia. “I thought we were past this.”</p><p>“Far from it,” I replied with a smile. “Anyways as I was saying; when she showed up I drained this gem that was filled up entirely with my magic. Long story short; if I didn’t it would have blown right there in my face. And Bronze’s.”</p><p>“I...see.”</p><p>“So? What happened? Wasn’t the plan to expose myself as I learn and slowly adapt my body to magic over time?”</p><p>Though Celestia was looking at me, I could tell her mind was elsewhere.</p><p>“If I had to guess,” she answered after a moment of silence. “I’d say you were forced to adapt with the sudden influx of magic.”</p><p>“Sooooo....what? Are you saying that I could just shock my body to hold more magic? Well hell then! Zap me right now. I can take it.”</p><p>“Unfortunately I don’t think that’ll work. Nor wise. Remember that you were under great duress at the time. Whether it was due to adrenaline or some other chemical your body was releasing, the condition at which you were at may have been just right for this to happen. And even if it was possible to, ‘force adapt’ if you will, I strongly advise against it. There might be repercussions to your body that we’re not aware of.”</p><p>“Damn,” I sighed disappointingly. “And here I thought I found a shortcut or something.”</p><p>“There are no such things as shortcuts with magic Rodney.”</p><p>“We’ll see,” I retorted which made her smile. “Never underestimate a human’s desire to not work hard.”</p><p>“In any case, I suggest you rest and recover during your time in the hospital. As I said there might be repercussions so it’s best you keep constant counsel with Twilight. And don’t fret about the media, I’ll give a statement regarding who and what you are soon. That should quell them. For now just-”</p><p>“Keep a low profile,” I finished. “Got it. Not really much else I could do stuck in a hospital bed.”</p><p>“The Haflax?” Celestia reminded.</p><p>“Hmm, point taken.”</p><p>“-cuse me.” We both turned towards the broken voice to see Redheart passing through the shimmering membrane. “I’m sorry Your Highness but I’ll have to ask you to leave now. Due to the situation all non patient or staff must leave the premises until we can get the situation under control.”</p><p>“I understand.” Celestia got up and trotted towards the door. “I’ll leave the spell as is. Leave it alone and it should last till just before daybreak tomorrow.”</p><p>“Thanks. It’ll help. Anything else?”</p><p>“I’ve given you much already. Simply keep what we discussed in mind. It was good talking with you again Rodney.”</p><p>“Alright, see ya Celes. Thanks for checking up on me.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it.” And with that, Celestia exited the room leaving me and Redheart alone.</p><p>“Wait,” spoke Redheart as she gazed around the room. “Where’s Bronze Sky?”</p><p>“He left.”</p><p>“Fantastic,” Redheart sighed in a tired tone. “Now on top of everything else that happened today I have to hunt him down and make sure he didn’t smuggle anything else in.”</p><p>I was about to apologize for the whole situation, after all both the Haflax and the media outside were sorta my fault. But before I could say anything I felt a spontaneous headache which made me swoon. I quickly held my head with a hand while the other grasped the side of the bed for support.</p><p>“Are you alright?” asked Redheart worryingly. I could hear her trot over and felt something wet and cold press against my temple. “Here, hold this.”</p><p>I grabbed the wet towel from her and held it against the side of my head. “It’s a headache.”</p><p>“Are you feeling nauseous?”</p><p>“No just a headache. It’s....oh.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s gone.” I waited a few seconds to make sure but true enough the headache disappeared just as sudden as it came.</p><p>“Hmm, just try to rest. It has been a long day and you’ve been through quite enough already. I’ll bring something up to eat later.” Despite her strict personality I could feel the worry and care in her voice. I guess her strictness was simply her way of caring for her patients.</p><p>“Thanks, I’d like that. Oh but no-”</p><p>“Flowers or any kind of grass. Yes I know. Miss Sparkle have already informed me of your diet.”</p><p>“Did she mention meat as well?” I asked with hope.</p><p>“She did but unfortunately we don’t keep stock of that. This is mainly a pony hospital.”</p><p>“Dammit.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[A minute earlier...]=========</p></div><p>As soon as Celestia exited the room and turned the corner, she paused and stood in place as a thought came to her. There was one last issue she needed to check.</p><p>Ignoring her entourage she turned and peeked back into the human’s room to see him converse with the nurse. With a thought her horn glowed ever so slightly while she cast a very weak but specific spell. Barely two seconds passed when she saw the human suddenly lurch a bit before steadying himself.</p><p>She held the spell for several second more to be sure of it’s effect before finally releasing it. Assured that the band was in place and functioning, Celestia turned and trotted away.</p><p>It pained her greatly to employ such measures, especially since she was rather fond of Rodney. Worse still, it forced Twilight to the tell the same lies over and over again. Celestia could tell from the way Twilight wrote her reports that she was becoming attached to him.</p><p>One part of Celestia wanted nothing more than to trust him after all he’d done. Yet another side, as the monarch and guardian of a nation and race, prevented her from doing so. It was simply too much of a risk.</p><p>Even if he choose not to abuse his abilities and limitless potential of magic. It did not mean others wouldn't. Equestria it was not without its share of enemies.</p><p>Deceived by changelings. Manipulated by Discord. Even her own cherished ponies might take advantage of him.</p><p>Such were only a few of the possible scenarios that could occur and the repercussions of them all were horrifying. Preparations needed to be placed to guard against all of them. Unfortunately the band was the only means Luna and her could come up with that assured their prevention.</p><p>Celestia hopped that one day, perhaps some years, she could tear down all the lies and ask forgiveness for pain she caused.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Canterlot...]=========</p></div><p>“You went back?” asked Luna in a grim voice.</p><p>“Yes Your Majesty,” answered Inquest. “But whatever this thing is it appears to have simply vanished. It left neither magical nor physical evidence behind. It’s possible that-”</p><p>“You knew this dragon, Falnor, would attack Ponyville; a town not far from where you were.” she asked again. Inquest knew his decision to return to the dragon’s lair would be an issue. He disliked the idea of repeating the same argument he had with Crea.</p><p>“I suspected-”</p><p>“You knew,” Luna interrupted again.</p><p>Inquest couldn’t help but sigh. “Yes! I knew!” he replied matching Luna’s tone. The exhaustion from the trip, the skirmish with Falnor, added with the dual long distance teleportation had affected Inquest’s thinking. Despite how calculative and disconnected he could be at most times, Inquest still retained some of his youthful bluster and recklessness.</p><p>“Weren’t you listening!?” shouted Inquest frustratingly. He saw Luna’s face scowl but he didn’t care. What bothered him was how nopony saw the real danger like he did. “This ‘thing’ somehow brought a full grown dragon under its control! I saw one of the most powerful creatures in the world tuned into a serf!!”</p><p><b>“We will not be spoken to in such manner!!”</b> shouted Luna momentarily lapsing back to her royal voice. The sheer force of her voice blew Inquest’s mane like a gale yet he did not falter in any way. In fact he matched the dark alicorn’s glare with his own refusing to back down.</p><p>Realizing they weren’t making any progress, Inquest took a deep breath to calm himself and swallowed his pride. If his instinct on the creature’s capabilities were true, research and countermeasures had to be prepared as soon as possible.</p><p>Especially by the Royal Princesses.</p><p>“It was a calculative decision You Majesty.” Inquest paused to let his words sink in. Seeing Luna remained silent, he took it as a cue to continue. “Yes, based on the situation I deduced that the dragon was flying towards Ponyville. And yes, had Crea and I immediately made our way to Ponyville we would have definitely been able to deal with the situation. Or at the very least, drive him away from town.”</p><p>“But thou hast deemed this creature of greater importance than the many lives of ponies?”</p><p>“Yes,” he answered without any hesitation. Luna couldn’t help but feel impressed by how much confidence that single word carried. “Considering the potential danger this creature poses I deemed it a higher priority that the residents of Ponyville.”</p><p>“Even the Elements?” Again there was a moment of silence. “Had we lost just one of them in the attack; we would have lost the most powerful weapon in our arsenal. One we could have used on this creature, especially considering how dangerous you believe it to be.”</p><p>“I....,” Inquest’s voice drifted away. Inquest rapped his mind for a reason but in truth this fact had eluded him at the time. Historically the Elements were only available for use so long as their chosen wielders lived. It was imperative then that they survived for as long as possible should circumstances require their assistance.</p><p>Had any of them died in the attack; it would have set Equestria back until the next Elements were born. Who knew what could happen till then? Inquest mentally slapped himself for failing to take such a critical variable into account.</p><p>“Enough,” Luna continued. “What’s done is done.” Inquest’s body visibly relaxed at hearing that. “You said Crea saw a black dragonchild?”</p><p>“It’s how she described the creature yes, but I have my doubts on that. No dragon and certainly no child can vanish like that. And our records also showed that he lived alone in the Everfree. Whatever this thing is, it is most certainly <b>not</b> a dragon.”</p><p>“A shape shifter then? It almost sounds like a changeling does it not?”</p><p>“Highly unlikely. Changelings would never choose a dragon as a target. Even if they could propagate a new class with similar physical characteristics as dragonkind, there would be no reason to. I had never heard of any dragon or drake that could have enough love to make it worthwhile. Falnor’s behavior also suggests some mind meddling was involved. The queen’s mind influence is certainly powerful but I seriously doubt it’s effective on a dragon.”</p><p>“So it truly is another ‘visitor’,” sighed Luna.</p><p>“I believe so,” Inquest concurred. “And unlike our human this one is most certainly hostile. From now on all our efforts regarding this matter should be to eliminate it.”</p><p>“Is that not too hasty? This is after all our first encounter. Perhaps it was simply-”</p><p>“It is hostile,” Inquest repeated. “There was no confusion of any kind. It ordered the dragon to attack us without any provocation. It could have ordered the attack on Ponyville as well.”</p><p>“And how do you plan on tracking it without any clue to its whereabouts? The Everfree is far too dangerous a place for an effective search effort.”</p><p>“I have a few ideas that can help, but nothing at the moment. It pains me to say this, but we’ll simply have to wait and prepare,” Inquest answered slightly ashamed. “It could be anywhere right now.”</p>

							<header><h1>Author's Notes:</h1></header>
<p>I am SOOOOOOOOO sorry this took so long. The chapter wasn’t particularly hard to write, I just had so little free time lately. I landed a job that I’ve been gunning for so my performance on that have been my top priority. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen I am officially part of the video game industry. </p><p>Ok enough of that. Now, some of you may notice a subpar quality. This is because Hollyhock is busy with his own project at the moment and haven't been able to edit. Personally I would just wait until it’s edited and ready but considering how long it’s been since the last update; I’ll make an exception. </p><p>I’ll just update this chapter with a better, less messier version later. </p><br/><p>Also, sometime ago I decided to do a little Q&amp;A to celebrate this fic hitting 1000+ likes. I hadn’t posted that up because I wanted it to go live along with this chapter. So here it is.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Q&amp;A]=========</p></div><p>Q:	Over the course of trying to write a story, I have created characters who I adore, elements that I want to use in the story (who dies, who romances who, etc), an ending that I want to achieve, and a sequel that I want to write. The problem? I don't have a story to fit all this in. All of this stuff is in my head, and I have a great deal of trouble writing out the raw information that is my overactive imagination. I also haven't been able to establish any sort of conflict or central plot or theme past who I want the antagonist to be. I don't want to just write a series of one-shots, and I don't want these ideas to just sit in my head forever. Has this ever happened to you? And what, if anything, do you do about it?</p><p>A:	Whoa, a tough one from the get go. Trust me on this, almost every writer, especially professionals, suffer from this. If the likes of R.A.Salvatore or Brent Weeks are given complete freedom to add every little idea they have in their work, it would never get done. The key is to nitpick which one of these fulfill an objective, which adds most depth to the character or pushes the story along. As painful as it is sometimes you just got to cut some ideas out plain and simple.</p><p>Still, this is a fanfic so nothing is restricted.  Perhaps you’ll find someway to make it work. A story that never ends? All I can say is good luck. And tell me if it works so I can do it too. </p><hr/><p>Q:	You probably get this a lot already but how did you get the ideas for magic? They way you explain magic has always been my favorite part of this fic. </p><p>Q: 	I really like the whole fire thing with Rodney. Did that come from an anime or something?</p><p>A: 	I’ll answer these two together. </p><p>For the first, I would have to say an ‘ordered imagination’. Just because it’s something like ‘magic’ doesn't mean it should be wild. How the ponies actually cast and create spells is the difficult part. Had to get inspiration from book and games. I simply added rules to it based off real world systems. Mainly the laws of energy; that’s where Rodney’s fire idea came from. </p><p>I’m not the first to make humans in HiE immune to magic. But I’ve always wondered: “Where does it go then?” I imagine that magic is just another type of energy, and energy can’t simply be erased like that. It can only be altered or transferred. So I thought, “Hey, why not just let the human keep it like a battery?” From then it all started forming in my head. </p><hr/><p>Q:	Oh my gosh I love Crea and Inquest so much!! Don’t hate me but I think their story is more interesting that Rodney’s. Their relationship sound so familiar though, where did you get the idea for them?</p><p>A:	Don’t worry I ain’t never gonna hate you for that. Their my creation and I’m happy someone other than myself fell in love with them. </p><p>It’s actually hard to say where I got the ideas for the two. Certainly both were inspired by something I once read in a book or played in a game but I can’t remember what. Funny thing though was I first wanted to only have Crea, Inquest came rather spontaneously. I just assumed there was something similar to the president’s science advisor of sorts in Equestria. Expect this one deals in magic and a total badass. It just took off from there. </p><hr/><p>Q:	Kill Falnor!!</p><p>A: 	No.</p><hr/><p>Q: 	So this fic has a romance tag for a while now but I haven’t seen anything. Maybe a bit here and there but is that it?</p><p>A:	Hmm this romance tag have been rather confusing for me as well. I definitely wanted to have some element of it but at the time I wasn’t sure exactly what merits a romance tag. I’ve thought of taking the tag down since it’s not really a core genre of this fic, seeing as a few might be misinformed. </p><p>But don’t worry, even if I did take it down doesn’t mean I’m getting rid of romance altogether. The story will go as I originally planned. It just means the story doesn’t have enough romance to merit the tag is all.  </p><hr/><p>Q:	I want some smexy time! Clop chapter please?</p><p>A: 	I don’t know about a clop chapter. I mean granted sex can be a hilarious set up for a chapter, but one entirely for clop? I don’t think I have the writing skills for something like that. I won’t say that I’ll never write one, but it’s unlikely. </p><p>Maybe I’ll just ask someone to write it for me. I’ve seen that happen in a fic or two. </p><hr/><p>Q:	Is Pinkie ever coming back in your AN’s?</p><p>A: 	<span style="font-size:0.875em">SSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! You never know when she’s listening.</span></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><span style="color:#FFC0CB;font-size:2em">Here I am!!</span></p><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/859b7e10a10a4fe31948196578f821205a61f90b?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc07.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Fi%2F2012%2F014%2F9%2Fc%2Fpinkie_pie___4th_wall_by_cptofthefriendship-d4mdrlt.png" /></p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGHH!!!!</span></p>						</aside>

A <i>‘timber’</i>wolf.” I couldn’t help but chuckle at the depiction of the creature. It was supposedly a animal-plant hybrid made up of various pieces of wood that mimicked the physical characteristics of a wolf. “This can’t be real,” I spoke to myself unable to believe such a creature could exist. “Is this real?”</p><p>“Uuuuuhh....”</p><p>“Seriously, it says here they can actually gather up their bodies and reconstruct themselves or even merge together.” I flipped the page hoping to find a detailed explanation of how it all worked only to find the next entry.</p><p>“Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh.....”</p><p>“How long are you gonna keep that up?” I pried my eyes away from the book and looked at the pegasus. He lay restlessly on his bed across the room moaning like a spoiled brat.</p><p>“Two days,” Bronze moaned miserably. “Two days with nothing to do or drink!”</p><p>“There’s a jug of water on the table next to you,” I replied flatly.</p><p>“Don’t start with me monkey, you know exactly what I mean!” he yelled threateningly.</p><p>“You sound like an addict.”</p><p>“I can’t deny that, but my…<i>inclination</i> towards the drink isn’t a problem. By Luna’s moon I’m better with it!”</p><p>“How so?” I asked with a chuckle.</p><p>“Well, if I hadn’t been drinking that night I would never have been crazy enough to take on a dragon on my own now would I? With that in mind, the drink saved your plot just as much as my shield did!” A loud metallic clang reverberated across the room as Bronze struck his massive shield with a hoof. Even then with the threat of the dragon far and gone, Bronze still refused to part ways with his shield, it leaned against the wall next to his bed within easy reach. That was not to say Redheart didn’t try, but neither her threats nor a bribe of liquor could make him yield his precious metal. Which made me even more curious to know the story behind it.</p><p>“Well trust me on this; the more you think about it the worse the urges get.”</p><p>“And how would you know that?”</p><p>A thick juicy cut of prime beef flashed in my mind. “Believe me, I know.” I turned my attention back to the book on my lap. “Grab one of the books and read, it’ll help pass the time,” I gestured my head to point at the stack of books next to my bed.</p><p>“What, those? Pfft, no way,” I could feel a light breeze as Bronze flapped that notion away with his good wing. “How you’re able to read those kinds of books all day, that’s what I can’t figure out. What, did that dragon sit on your head or something?”</p><p>“It’s interesting,” I answered pragmatically flipping to another page.  </p><p>“It’s an encyclopedia!” he shouted. “Who reads an encyclopedia!?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘It is rather awkward.’</span></p><p><i>‘Yeah well, that was before I had to fight for my life against a dragon. Had I actually known about them before, things might have gone differently. Would’ve been nice to know they can breathe homing fireballs and heal themselves.’</i></p><p>“Books,” Bronze mumbled again. “Out of all the things you could have asked for; you wanted books. You could have at least gotten one of those those saucy novels but no~o, you wanted textbooks and encyclopedias.”</p><p>Looking at the pile of books nearby I could understand why Bronze reacted like he did. Half of them were part of a world encyclopedia, while the others consisted of textbooks, and even a few guidebooks for children. I didn’t specifically chose any of them. During one of Twilight’s visits I simply asked for something that could help me learn more about this world, which she was more than happy to bring. Looking at it now, I should’ve expected her to go overboard like she did, but at least that left me with something to do to ward off the boredom.</p><p>There was one problem with Twilight’s visits however; every time she came Shine accompanied her. That was not to say that I had a problem with her or anything, and Twilight told me she’d been nothing but helpful around the library, but ever since Celestia’s visit I couldn't help but keep my guard up against her, always fearing she’d suddenly pull a prank when I least expected it. But from what I gathered it didn’t look like Shine had any specific orders to carry out. It seemed she was here to just keep an eye on me like Celestia said. Worse still; memory of that kiss she gave me before my departure to Ponyville kept coming back whenever I saw her.</p><p>Which made every meeting slightly awkward.</p><p>“You think they’re still out there?” Bronze asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Let’s find out.” With a levitation spell I lifted a medium sized mirror, something Rarity left behind for my use after her visit. I made it hover at an angle right against the window. “Yup, they’re still there.” From the mirror I could see the group of ponies lazing around in front of the hospital. “A few left, but they're all mostly still there.”</p><p>I couldn’t stand the idea of being in a closed room throughout my entire stay in the hospital. So the day after the media arrived I decided to give up and just let them take as many photos as they wanted. Occasionally one or two would take a picture. That I could tolerate, but after a while all they were really after was actual information and an interview. At least Bronze seemed to enjoy ruining their shots, he kept photo bombing and blocking shot after shot just to irritate them.</p><p>Somewhere out there, one poor unfortunate soul had a photo of Bronze’s rear end in all its glory.</p><p>“Well you gotta give them some credit, they’re a stubborn bunch,” Bronze commented.</p><p>“Yeah well, I doubt Celestia and Luna’s press conference answered everyone’s questions.” I pulled the mirror and placed it back on the table next to a newspaper from the day before.</p><p>As expected the front page was all about the dragon attack with a picture of Ponyville from high above, clearly showing the amount of destruction the dragon had done. Celestia and Luna’s press conference was mostly about assuring the population that the attack was an isolated incident and not a breach the treaty. However there was another section on the third page which included a photo of me on the hospital bed next to Celestia. Probably from one of the many photos the media took when they first arrived at the hospital.</p><p>Near the end of the press conference, I became the only topic when events of the attacks were being questioned. Every one of them seemed to be aware that it was ultimately Luna who had subdued Falnor, yet they had greater interest in the unknown animal; namely me. The tone of the article was to be expected, there was much suspicion and questions about what I was exactly, where I came from, and why my existence had never been publicly announced. Most were given the “no comment” response, raising even more questions.</p><p>Luna went on to reveal my battle with Falnor, nothing specific but enough for everyone to know that I helped defend the town. Unfortunately they’d assumed that I was actually as dangerous as a dragon, which made them wonder about the wisdom of letting <i>“something”</i> like me live freely amongst them. The chains around my wrists only pushed that notion further; it made it look like I was a dangerous animal that needed to be leashed. Fortunately, Celestia and Luna were adamant in their trust and support for me. Considering who they were, that should have been enough to ward off a great deal of trouble.</p><p>All in all, the whole article could have gone better, but it certainly wasn’t the worst that it could.</p><p>“You read the newspaper, they only gave out the most basic information about me. They got more out of the ponies in town than what Celestia and Luna offered.” I made a mental note to thank those that I knew, overall the townsfolk seem to like me well enough, and my image hadn’t gone any worse. Once news of my part in saving the town had spread, my image should only have improved, but you can’t please everyone. Apparently, someone still saw me as, and I quote, “a fire hazard”.</p><p>“How much do you think they’ll pay me for an exclusive interview?” Bronze suddenly asked.</p><p>“You? Why would they want to interview you?”</p><p>“Well I was there fighting the dragon with you.” Bronze stood on his bed and took an exaggerated heroic pose; one fore hoof pointing upwards while his wings were spread to the side.“The lone pegasi that battled against a fearsome and powerful dragon! Accompanied by nopony else but his trusted monkey companion.”</p><p>I just rolled my eyes and let that jest slide. “Well count me out. I ain’t ready to go public just yet.”</p><p>“Oh I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I’ve been known to be quite persuasive.” Both Bronze and I turned our heads towards the door. A nurse with a pink mane and tail, and a deep orange coat trotted in carrying a trolley laden with various bottles and medical tools.</p><p>Before either of us could say anything, she gave a quick glance towards the door and closed it behind her. With a gentle push that sent the trolley off to the side, the mare nonchalantly tossed her nurse cap away revealing a small notepad and pencil perfectly balanced atop her head.</p><p>“Quillstride, at your service,” she greeted with a friendly smile.</p><p>“Oh…..kay,” I turned to Bronze with a confused expression.</p><p>“She’s a reporter,” he explained. “Snuck in by pretending to be one of the staff.” He turned to look at the mare. “That was a smart move, the regular staff would just assume you were one of the nurses sent from Canterlot to help.”</p><p>“Well you know what they say; you need to take risks to get what you want. And I’m willing to go all the way for my story,” she responded cheerfully before her full attention shifted to me. Her eyes scanned me from top to bottom only to linger for a moment on my shackles. “So you’re the mon-”</p><p>“Say monkey and I’ll call the head nurse,” I warned with a stern tone.</p><p>“Only those close to him get that privilege,” Bronze joked which I responded by magically throwing a pillow right at his face, making him laugh heartily.</p><p>“Hmm, shackled and creates blue fire.” I saw Quillstride pull the pencil out of her notepad and made a quick note with her mouth. “So they were telling the truth.”</p><p>While shopping around town for Rarity, either to resupply her boutique or during some other errand, I had seen non unicorns write with their mouths. From what I could gather, it seemed they just held by lightly biting down while using their lips for finer control. It was still quite amusing to watch.</p><p>“Which means the explosion everypony saw was your doing,” Quillstride concluded as she trotted closer.</p><p>“Out!” I interrupted. “Before I call-”</p><p>“Hold on there Rodney, I think you should reconsider this.” I looked at Bronze with a raised brow. “It’s better if you do this now and get it over with before things gallop out of control.”</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“He’s right you know,” the mare added. “How long do you think it will be before another newspony breaks the law to get to you, hmm? Even if you somehow avoid their pursuits completely, some will eventually make things up. The longer you avoid it, the crazier these rumors will become.”</p><p>“And everyone will just believe it?” I asked. “I’m pretty sure it’s a crime to make up information like that.”</p><p>“It is, but what do you expect? That they’ll leave if you ignore them long enough? You’re likely the hottest topic in Equestria right now, spurred even further by the first dragon attack. Whether you like it or not, every newspaper has their eyes set on you. More than a few ponies will take advantage of that and make up rumors based on nothing more than wild guesswork. Most of those will no doubt do more harm than anything else.”</p><p>So far her reasoning seemed to make sense, it had happened plenty of times before back in my world so I guessed I shouldn’t be surprised if the same happened here. Plus Celestia not only gave permission, she actually urged me to do so, suggesting only that I should take great care to choose the appropriate media outlet.</p><p>“Alright, an interview it is then.” Quillstride’s eyes lit up as she beamed with joy at her success.</p><p>“Excellent!” She trotted even closer while flipping her notepad to a brand new page. “Let’s begin with-”</p><p>“Hold on there,” I cut in with a raised a hand. “I said I’d do an interview but I never said I’d do it with you.”</p><p>“My my, aren’t you’re a careful one.”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>Quillstride laughed at that. “It is a compliment. Well then, I’m proud to say that I have quite the reputation as a journalist.”</p><p>“One that breaks the law?”</p><p>“Amongst other things; now let me finish. Unlike most newsponies I work for myself and offer the stories I uncover only to who I choose.”</p><p>“You’re a freelancer,” I commented.</p><p>“I’m….not familiar with that term. But I like it. <i>Free</i>lancer,” she repeated.</p><p>“I’m still waiting for the part where you’re supposed to convince me.”</p><p>Quillstride merely rolled her eyes. “I’m getting to that. Now, other newsponies would offer payment for something like this; I on the other hoof will add you to my very special list.” I waited for the mare to elaborate but she just stood there with a confident smile as if I understood the significance of it.</p><p>“Hmm, getting paid, or being in list of favors for a pony I’ve only just met,” I pondered sarcastically. It seems that was exactly what she wanted to hear because as soon as I spoke her smile grew wider.</p><p>“What I’m offering is indeed favor Mr. Rodney,” she explained.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Mr.?’</span></p><p>“Favor as in debt?”</p><p>“Something like that,” she cleared her throat and her demeanor shifted to something that looked more professional. “Since I’ve offered my services to various papers, I've managed to befriend a few of their employees. In other words I have my own personal network in all the major papers, all vying to stay friendly, hoping I’ll let them publish my next big scoop. Being in my ‘special’ list means I’ll keep my ears out for anything that could be of interest to you.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh, I like where this is going.’</span></p><p>“And you’re willing to put me in this list for an exclusive?”</p><p>“Oh please, a single exclusive is hardly enough to pay for the services I offer. No, I’m not asking for just an interview, I want to be your one and only connection to the media.”</p><p>“You want to monopolize me?” I asked slightly surprised by the proposition.</p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I say take the offer, there’s no telling how much we can get from her.’</span></p><p><i>‘Slow down, we still need to be careful. For all we know this could all be bullshit.’</i></p><p>“That’s….an interesting proposal, but how do I know this offer is real? Far as I know you could be lying about everything just to so that I’ll agree to an interview. Heck I still don’t know if you’ll write the article fairly or not.”</p><p>“Well for one thing, nopony can maintain or even create a network like mine without being reputable. Which means I only have to prove that my network exists. So how’s about I give you an example of my services?” I looked at her with confusion as she flipped through her notepad. “One employee based in Canterlot informed me that the newspaper she’s working for has a special piece about you for their next edition.”</p><p>“I suppose this one’s different from the ones before?”</p><p>“Oh it will be. Unlike other news outlets, it seems the Canterlot Post was offered an interview from somepony who knows all about you.”</p><p>For a split second I thought of Twilight, I had shared more with her than anyone else so far, but she wasn't the type to do that. Especially knowing how disappointed Celestia would get once she heard of it. Then I thought of Rarity, but even though she greatly enjoyed attention, it was not like her to do something like that either. At least not without my permission.</p><p>“Who?” I asked, unable to identify the mysterious pony.</p><p>Quillstride leaned in close before mentioning the name in a hushed tone. “Prince Blueblood.”</p><p>My eyes immediately widened with surprise and fear.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Ah shit.’</span></p><p><i>‘Blueblood.’</i> It had been a long time since I had last thought about him, but just remembering that self-worshiping sack of shit worsened my mood. It looked like after all that time he still held a grudge with me for burning his tail, something I should’ve expected from his personality. If what Quillstride said was true, then it would be his revenge. He’d ruin my reputation in every way he knew how, and he was royalty; that alone made his word carry greater weight. Whether it was true or not.</p><p>“Honestly I’m impressed, I knew the Princesses trusted you but I didn’t expect you to be so close with a member of the royal family. With Prince Blueblood no less.&quot; From how she spoke it seems Blueblood managed to keep his rotten personality hidden while keeping a sterling reputation. Nothing but a miracle in my opinion.</p><p>“What was that now?” Bronze asked overhearing the name.</p><p>“Prince Blueblood is giving a special interview on Mr. Rodney,” the mare answered.</p><p>“That can’t be good,” Bronze spoke in a worried tone. “I spent my early years in service stationed at Canterlot and trust me on this: Anything that comes out that rotten waste of space they call a Prince will be bound to cause nothing but problems for you monkey.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Well, at least he knows the truth.’</span></p><p>“I take it this article doesn’t bode well for you?” Quill said catching up. “Are you acquainted with him?”</p><p>“Unfortunately,” I woefully spat. “Is there a way to pull that article from being published?”</p><p>“Not unless you can get a royal order signed by both Princesses. Or…”</p><p>“Or?” I repeated expectantly.</p><p>She smiled at me. “Or if they have something a lot more interesting to publish, say an exclusive interview with the mysterious creature?” Her smile grew wider, she might not know the whole story but she could tell I didn't want Blueblood’s article to ever see the light of day.</p><p>“Alright, alright, you win,” I sighed. “I’ll do the damn interview.”</p><p>Her smile grew to a wide grin that showed her pearly white teeth. “And?”</p><p>I sighed again. “Yes, I’ll let you monopolize me.” To my amusement she actually spun around in a small victory dance. “But swear to me that article gets buried.”</p><p>“What’s more interesting to read? Somepony talking about a mysterious creature never before seen in the world; or an interview with the actual creature itself?” I gave her a peeved look. “I meant himself’,” she quickly corrected.</p><p>“What about time? You said tomorrow’s edition was being-”</p><p>“Never underestimate the media,” Quillstride interrupted. “Trust me, once I give them this interview they’ll forget all about that article. That is if I can get it to them in time.” Quillstride glanced towards the clock on the wall showing it was near two in the afternoon. “Not a lot of time left,” she spoke in fake worry. “Shall we begin?”</p><p>I looked towards Bronze for his approval, which he gave with a slight nod. “Alright, let’s do this. But understand that there are questions I cannot answer.”</p><p>“Perfect! That’ll make the readers even more interested. Everypony loves secrets!” I merely shook my head at that.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Canterlot Research Tower]=========</p></div><p>“So,” the gryphon spoke in a tone full of boredom. “Are you just going to tinker around with your contraptions all day again?” As expected the question completely flew past the unicorn unnoticed while he trotted between his many contraptions.</p><p>After their return from the Everfree, Inquest had invested all his time in testing and experimentation in order to track down this elusive ‘visitor’ from another world. Unfortunately for Crea, her skills and expertise as a hunter workerd exclusively on the field. Were it any other jungle or prey the gryphon would have no trouble putting her them to work. However this was the Everfree, wild and untamed in both nature and magic. Furthermore she lacked the necessary information on her quarry; to charge headlong against a hostile unprepared was the easiest way to forfeit one’s life.</p><p>Which meant they needed a different, long range method of tracking and detection. That’s where Inquest’s vast expertise of the world and magic came in. His initial and only idea so far was to monitor changes in every measurable element near and around the Everfree forest.</p><p>For that reason Inquest had, to the ire of the many Arcanists employed, completely refurbished the castle’s main laboratory for his own use, effectively suspending or even terminating various on-going research and experiments. Some were even his own which he discarded without any regard. A testament to how dangerous Inquest perceived this other ‘visitor’.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite all the work, effort, and sacrifice, despite all the many machines and specialized equipment he requisitioned, Inquest had made no progress in locating the target. Half of the inventions and prototypes were built by the unicorn himself, and none of them had even been seen in public or passed basic safety regulations. In addition these instruments required a vast amount of magic to function, meaning nothing less than rare arcane gems were needed, which made the entire setup expensive beyond reason. To make matters more complicated, the forest itself was an anomaly of the world, one of three known locations where nature was unbound by magic. Making it extremely difficult, perhaps even impossible, to differentiate between a fluctuation due to the forest itself, or caused by the ‘visitor’.</p><p>“Gah!” Several vials and tools around the unicorn glowed ghostly white before suddenly shooting up to the air and flying towards the walls, causing a loud clamour as they broke to pieces.</p><p>“I take it things didn’t go well?” Crea teased, pulling her head back after dodging one of the projectiles. She knew pushing Inquest’s buttons wouldn’t help, but she simply loved to see the often composed pony stirred up with frustration.  </p><p>“This is impossible!!” he shouted, ignoring the gryphon. “If it had just left something behind for me to work with!! To leave no trace of its presence like that is inconceivable!”</p><p>“You’re so cute when you get all flustered and confused.”</p><p>“This is not a matter to make light of!” Inquest moved past a row of machines, pausing in front of each to read the measurements for the upteenth time. “Am I the only one that realizes the severity and danger this creature represents?” Out of pure frustration Inquest lifted one of the contraptions, twice the width of a pony and as tall, crushing it to a cube with sheer magic before it fell to the ground with a loud heavy clang.</p><p>Crea merely sighed and made her way towards the pony, letting her wing drop over him in order to calm his emotions. This side of Inquest was rarely seen, and even then, only by her. This was not an equation or problem that could be solved with leisure, this was something that involved the lives of others with time working against him. During their many adventures Crea had seen Inquest lose his cool, especially when the mission played on his emotions. This seldom happened but when it did; the results were always disastrous.</p><p>That reminded Crea of one particular mission from long ago.</p><p>“Inquest, do you remember Rot Wrike?”</p><p>“Crea I don’t have time to reminis-”</p><p>“Do you remember?” Crea repeated.</p><p>Inquest let out a tired sigh and searched through his vast memory for the name. “The diamond dog burglar. We were told to capture him and retrieve...what was it?”</p><p>“A statue. Something called a totem that belonged to the Buffalo Tribes.” Crea chuckled as more of the memory poured forth. “We spent three days playing chase with that one.”</p><p>“Rot Wrike. I’ve never seen a diamond dog dig so fast.” Inquest shook his head in disbelief. “He dug faster than we could chase.”</p><p>“Teleporting didn’t help either, soon as you appeared he’d dig in a different direction.” Crea’s chuckle grew to laughter. “It took three days for the best hunter and Equestria’s Professor to catch him.”</p><p>Crea’s mirth eventually overcame the pony as he too started to chuckle. “The whole thing was ridiculous. Seeing that dog dig…he must have had mole mixed in his blood.” Inquest let out a deep breath as his emotions settled down. “So what about him?”</p><p>“Well, don’t you think this is similar?”</p><p>Inquest gave her a puzzled look. “How exactly is this similar? You easily tracked him down and I managed to mark him with a spell. From that point on we knew exactly where he was at all times.”</p><p>“True, but we still couldn’t catch him. Not until-”</p><p>“We predicted where he’d be,” Inquest finished as his eyes sharpened. It was simple; they had anticipated where he’d be and laid an ambush to which he had no escape.</p><p>Crea could tell how his mind was racing, fresh ideas starting to stack one atop the other. She loved the way he looked at times like this. It was extremely tempting for her to lunge at the old unicorn, but knowing how important this was she held herself in check.</p><p>“If we can’t find this creature,” Inquest continued thinking out loud, “then we’ll simply have to predict where it’ll be. In order to do that however, we need to know it’s motive.” Inquest was suddenly engulfed in ghost white aura as he teleported to face a large table on the other side of the room.</p><p>“The motive….the motive….the motive….” Inquest mumbled over and over again as various documents floated from the table to hover in front of him. His eyes darted madly side to side while his head turned occasionally from one document to the next. It was his own detailed report of their encounter with Falnor and the creature, now with a different angle in mind, he analyzed the report thoroughly.</p><p>Crea settled back to a comfortable position as she watched the pony work with renewed fervor. The way his chest grew and shrunk as he breathed in control, the way sucked his lips tight, how his tail swung ever so slightly like a metronome. It was all so nostalgic for her, she could easily remember a far younger Inquest doing the exact same thing back before he was appointed Professor.</p><p>It was during one such occasion that she finally realized her love for the pony.</p><p>“The dragon….”</p><p>Hearing Inquest’s hushed voice snapped Crea out of her reverie. “What was that?”</p><p>“The dragon,” Inquest repeated. “Why send the dragon away?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as Inquest dove back into deep thought. “What would you do if you found yourself lost and alone in an alien world?” Inquest continued. “What would be your first emotion?”</p><p>“Uhm….fear I guess.”</p><p>“Exactly! Fear; this creature would have been frightened. You’d go and find some shelter. What if you stumbled into a cave? I believe that’s how the dragon first got involved in this.”</p><p>“Ok,” Crea responded to show she was following along.</p><p>“I’m not sure how it managed to control the dragon, but clearly it did. So at this point it found security with Falnor acting as a guardian.”</p><p><i>‘That made sense,’</i> Crea thought. <i>‘The mere presence of a dragon would hold any predator at bay.’</i> Then a thought struck her mind in a moment of realization.</p><p>“So why send the dragon away?” Crea asked finally understanding the question from before.</p><p>“Exactly!” Inquest shouted excitedly. “Why send Falnor away!? Especially if you thought danger was close. All the more the reason to keep him nearby.”</p><p>“Maybe it didn’t need Falnor anymore.”</p><p>“That’s possible. A dragon can be a wealth of knowledge to learn about this world. Perhaps it has learned enough and became confident it could survive on its own. It could be that the attack was merely a distraction for it to slip away, it’s the simplest explanation. But that doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>“Why not? Clearly it worked.”</p><p>“Yes, it did. But a dragon for a distraction?” Inquest shook his head. “No that doesn’t make any sense. A dragon is such a useful tool and a powerful asset, to sacrifice that just for mere distraction? I don’t think so. It’s illogical.”</p><p>“Well maybe it didn’t think things through. We don’t know how smart this thing is.”</p><p>“I certainly hope you’re right, that makes it far less dangerous than I believed it to be.” He paused, continuing to pace distractedly as he gathered his thoughts. “Though I doubt that’s true. The way it covered its tracks so perfectly requires strategizing, forethought and calculation. Besides, it’s best if we err on the side of caution.”</p><p>“So, not a distraction then?” Crea’s eagle eyes followed Inquest as he moved about in his pacing.</p><p>“It’s not definite but highly improbable. I’d say it had a different motive.” Inquest came to a sudden stop as a thought sprung up in his mind. “We might be asking the wrong question.”</p><p>“And the right question would be?”</p><p>“Why <i>Ponyville</i>?”</p><p>“It’s the closest settlement to the Everfree,” the gryphon answered. It was the simplest and first explanation that came to her mind.</p><p>“Why not Canterlot? It is further away but nothing considered too far, it would probably take less than two hours for Falnor to fly here. As the seat of power in Equestria, Canterlot is the better target to cause the greatest amount of damage and disturbance.” Again Inquest shook his head as the puzzle refuse to fit. “I believe it’s safe to assume that Ponyville became a target for a specific reason.”</p><p>“I don’t know much about the neighboring area. Usually I just drop by for a mission and leave soon after. Far as I can tell it’s just a small town like any other.”</p><p>“That might be true at a glance, but there’s actually a number of reasons that would make Ponyville a target.” Inquest’s horn glowed as he pulled a large wheeled blackboard from the other side of the room and started to make a list.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>1. Closest settlement.</b></p></div><p>“We can’t ignore the fact that it’s in close proximity to the Everfree and thus to the ‘visitor’. Perhaps it really is that simple.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>2. The protege.</b></p></div><p>“I’m not sure if you’re aware but Celestia’s prized student currently resides in Ponyville.”</p><p>“I think I remember her,” Crea replied thinking back. “Purple unicorn right? I saw her a couple of times when I was here. And every time she had her muzzle buried in a book.”</p><p>“That's the one, her name is Twilight Sparkle. Over the years Celestia has grown attached to her and she’s also a sibling to Shining Armor. So if one were to have her as hostage it would give enormous leverage over the Princess and the Captain. Those are two critical assets that control and protect Equestria. Moving on...”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>3. The Elements. </b></p></div><p>“Wait a sec, <i>the</i> Elements?” Crea asked surprised.</p><p>“Yes, the Elements of Harmony. Equestria’s last line of defense, they’re what have always saved us when all else failed. All the current bearers also reside in Ponyville, including the protege.”</p><p>“Huh,” Crea spoke slightly dumbfounded. “I heard the Elements took down Chaosfather in a small town, I’m guessing that’s Ponyville. Didn’t expect them to live in a place like that.”</p><p>“Chaosfather?”</p><p>“It’s what us gryphons call him.” Crea suddenly let out a chuckle. “Always thought he was just a story you ponies made up to scare the kids.”</p><p>Inquest took a step back, “I see. In any case, it’s a short list but each of them are vital to Equestria. There’s no way to precisely determine what its real motivation is, or if it’s even one of these three. But it’s clear that Ponyville requires protection.” Inquest levitated the chalk once more to underline the last two reasons on the list. “We must not allow the ‘visitor’ to take control of Twilight or any of the Element bearers like it did to Falnor. Their safety is paramount.”</p><p>“Then let’s just get them out of there. Bring them here for protection.” Instead of agreeing to the logical choice, Inquest merely stared at the blackboard in deep thought. “Inquest?”</p><p>“No. We can’t.”</p><p>“And why not?” Crea asked growing suspicious.</p><p>“Because we need them to lure the ‘visitor’ out in the open. If we take them here-”</p><p>“You just said their safety was paramount,” Crea interrupted. “Now you’re going to use them as bait!?”</p><p>“I know, it’s risky,” Inquest calmly replied.</p><p>“That’s an understatement!”</p><p>“But it’s the only chance we have of capturing this creature. With the way it covers its tracks we might never get another shot.”</p><p>“Look at me.” Inquest turned and stared deep into the gryphon’s eyes. Silence fell as Crea searched for any sign of hesitation but she found none, the unicorn’s large eyes didn’t waver one bit and held strong. Obviously he wasn’t certain the plan would work, but he was deadset on this plan.</p><p>Crea let out a resigned sigh. “So, to Ponyville?”</p><p>“To Ponyville.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Nightfall]=========</p></div><p>It scurried through the tall grass causing only the faintest disturbance. Quick and nearly impossible to see, a rat made its way through the field, approaching the large structure far ahead. It paused periodically and sniffed the night air, head swerving left and right as it searched around for any danger.</p><p>Once at a reasonable distance from the structure it approached a nearby tree. As soon as it reached the base the rodent disappeared as if the earth had suddenly swallowed it up. Within a few seconds shadows began to rise from the ground like smoke, they twirled and molded themselves as if alive growing larger and thicker with every passing moment. Soon a purely black cat stood where the rodent had disappeared, perfectly melding with the darkness around it.</p><p>With grace and speed it climbed the old tree.  Only the faintest scratching sounded as its claws dug into bark, trailing wispy darkness behind. Silently maneuvering past sticks and leaves, the cat finally found the perfect branch both high and strong enough to hold its weight. The cat’s slitted yellow eyes glowed reflecting the light from the structure while examining its surrounding from its perch. </p><p>A group of ponies were gathered outside the structure, some asleep while others talked amongst each other. Through the windows, the feline saw more of them inside the building. Most that moved about wore a white outfit while others lay in beds. Suddenly the cat’s ears perked up and its hairs stood on ends as it focused on one particular window to the side.</p><p>There, on a bed lay the impossible and dangerous creature.</p><p>“Found you,” it spoke in a childish singsong manner before climbing down and disappearing into the night.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 38 - I know you want this<br/>Edited by Hollyhock &amp; AndyGrey<br/>Pre-read by Same (duh. Hollyhock)</p><p>Credit for the art goes to Hollyhock. Thank you again. </p><hr/><p>“Come now Twilight,” he reached out and caressed the side of her muzzle. “I know you want this.”</p><p>“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She raised a hoof to push him away only to feel his fingers wrap around it. </p><p>“Enough with playing pretend.” Twilight let out a yelp as she was suddenly pulled towards him. She tried to resist, but the soft silk underneath kept making her hooves slide over the mattress. </p><p><i>‘Matress?’</i> Glancing around Twilight realized she was atop an impossibly large bed, surrounded by a wall of large pillows. Everything was colored in varying shades of red, and even the air seem to glow, creating a very <i>intimate</i> feel to the place. No matter where she looked, certain thoughts kept appearing in her mind making her body hotter than usual. </p><p>“No more games Twilight.” She felt the mattress sink as the human suddenly lunged forward and leaned over her with hands pressed beside her head. They were apart by mere inches now and Twilight could feel the heat from his body. </p><p>“Wait! Rodney I-I….I’ll give you all the meat you want, ok?” Twilight begged. </p><p>“That’s generous, but no. The only meat I’m interested in eating...” Twilight pushed her head back against the bed as he started to descend. “Is. Right. Here.”</p><p>“Aaah!!” Twilight screamed, her horn bursting into light as she attempted an emergency teleport. </p><hr/><p>“Spike? Are you in there?” Shine called, her voice echoing into the bathroom. </p><p>“Ahm khere,” the young dragon replied before continuing to brush his teeth. From the mirror he saw the door open to reveal the library’s newest resident. </p><p>“Breakfast is ready,” Shine Bright informed Spike in a pleasant tone. </p><p>“Okhay,” was Spike’s only reply as he continued to stare at his reflection. A thought came to mind as he regarded his counterpart in the mirror; he hadn’t grown much. </p><p>In fact, the more he thought about it, the more he realized how little he has changed physically. He turned his head, bared his fangs, stuck out his tongue, and circled in place trying to find something different or new. But nothing had changed; the same purple scales, the same blunt green spikes, the same round belly and the same tail. </p><p>Nothing had changed at all. </p><p><i>‘If only I was bigger,’</i> he thought. That of course led him to remember the time he grew to adulthood in a matter of days. <i>‘I could’ve taken that dragon on by myself if I...’</i> Spike shook his head discarding that train of thought. He knew that was wishful thinking, the last time it happened he had lost control of himself and wrecked the town. Ponyville would have been left with two dragons to deal with. With a long depressed sigh the young dragon leaned over the sink and cleaned himself before jumping off his stool with breakfast on his mind.  </p><p>But just as he was about to reach for the door, he heard a loud heavy din from right outside. He immediately rushed to the window and leaned his head outside, searching for the disturbance. First he scanned the skies, expecting to see the green dragon return for another attack on the town. Relieved to see the skies clear, he turned his gaze downward and spotted the source of the commotion. </p><p>“Uhh, Twilight?” Spike called, recognizing the purple mare laying atop her bed out in broad daylight. “What are you do…. Did you teleport in your sleep!?” Instead of answering, Twilight started to scramble away from her bed, only to stumble over and land head-first onto the ground making Spike flinch. “Are you ok!?” he yelled, now worried. </p><p>“Spike?” she finally spoke, recognizing his voice. “Wha...I was...” Even from that height, Spike could see her eyes widen in surprise while her entire head glowed red with embarrassment. All around her, ponies who were going about their business froze in place to stare at the librarian and her bed-mane.</p><p>Spike saw her horn glow bright, and Twilight, along with her bed, disappeared into thin air shortly before hearing a loud thud originating from the bedroom.</p><p>“Spike,” Shine called from downstairs. “What was that?”</p><p>“Nothing to worry about!” Spike shouted back. “This oughta be interesting,” he spoke in a quiet voice and left the bathroom. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sometime after...]=========</p></div><p>“A nightmare?” Spike repeated skeptically. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes Spike, a nightmare,” Twilight answered before taking a mouthful of hay. Spike stared suspiciously across the table at the unicorn. It took him some time, but he eventually managed to convince Twilight to come out from under her blanket and walk down to the kitchen for breakfast.   He noted that she was still blushing after the incident, but he simply assumed it was embarrassment from having her bed-mane publicly revealed. </p><p>“I haven’t seen you sleepcast in years. Back then you only made things levitate.” Spike took a bite of his emerald. “To actually teleport, that must have been one nasty nightmare.”</p><p>“Not to mention extremely dangerous,” Shine added from one side of the table. “Apologies ma’am, that was rude of me.”</p><p>“Please Shine, just Twilight. And don’t apologise, you’re right that was dangerous.” Twilight sighed. “Princess Celestia will be so disappointed if she finds out. The very first thing she taught me was to make sure I had complete control over my magic, and because of him, I lost it.”</p><p>“<i>Him?</i>” Spike asked, catching the slip. </p><p>“I-eh. Did the paper arrive yet?” Twilight quickly asked, hoping to divert the subject. </p><p>“It hasn’t,” Shine answered as she took her empty plate to the sink. “I don’t think the mail service would be operational so soon after the atta-” Shine was cut off when something heavy collided with the front door. The impact echoed loudly throughout the library. </p><p>“Mail’s here,” Spike spoke casually, before hopping out of his seat and walking towards the front door. </p><p>Twilight noticed Shine's confused expression. &quot;Our mail mare is rather...unique”</p><p>Shine gave another look towards the front door before continuing to clean her plate. While Shine was busy cleaning, Twilight noticed something different about her kitchen. The wooden walls were gleaming and there wasn’t a speck of dirt on the floor. </p><p>“Shine, did you clean the kitchen?” Twilight asked, she knew that Spike was never this meticulous with his chores. </p><p>“Just a bit. I woke up before daybreak and well... I didn’t really know what to do with myself. So I decided to help with the chores. After all, you’re letting me stay in your home, this is the least I can do. Oh, but don’t worry; I cleaned, but left everything where it was.”</p><p>“I’m grateful for what you did, but…,” Twilight paused as she formulated her thoughts. “I know Celestia sent you to help keep an eye on Rodney, but you’re not my maid or anything...”</p><p>“I’m aware of that ma’am-”</p><p>“Twilight,” the unicorn corrected again.</p><p>“Uhm, Twilight. With Rodney still in the hospital there’s little for me to do until the next visit. I hope I’m not too intrusive.”</p><p>“You’re not. I just wanted to make sure that-”</p><p>“You two will want to take a look at this,” Spike interrupted. Both mares turned just as Spike returned with the newspaper. Before either mare could inquire what he meant, the dragon held the front page for both to see. </p><p>“An interview!?” Twilight shouted, both surprise and slightly confused. </p><p>“I thought the newsponies were restricted from entering the hospital,” Shine wondered aloud. “How did anypony manage to… Do you think it’s fake?”</p><p>“I seriously doubt that,” Twilight replied, levitating the newspaper out of Spike’s grasp. “The Canterlot Post won’t risk their reputation unless it’s legitimate.” </p><p>“I bet they’re calling him a hero,” Spike spoke impassively, which Twilight noted as strange. She watched her adopted sibling for a moment as he went back to breakfast, before her attention returned to the article. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/31f67f8c2fdb023949605467cfd9268c36340968?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc02.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2013%2F281%2Fb%2Fc%2Fpg_1_by_al3xguerra-d6prt6n.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a href="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/281/b/c/pg_1_by_al3xguerra-d6prt6n.jpg" rel="nofollow">[Link]</a></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/bf2113eb39c3132f84323bea9e70513d93c1cc95?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffc07.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Ff%2F2013%2F281%2Fa%2F9%2Fcanterlot_post_issue_1_pg_2_by_al3xguerra-d6prk1j.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a href="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/281/a/9/canterlot_post_issue_1_pg_2_by_al3xguerra-d6prk1j.jpg" rel="nofollow">[Link]</a></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Carousel Boutique]=========</p></div><p>“How many-ngh more do you need?” Sweetie Belle spoke while trying her best to roll a square bundle of cloth.</p><p>“Two should be enough,” replied Rarity. Despite the focus needed to control the numerous floating tools, Rarity could barely contain her excitement. The front page of today’s newspaper was a pleasant surprise, but the real gift was reading the small section that mentioned the boutique. </p><p>She felt euphoric imagining the towering amount of attention her work would receive. There had been opportunities in the past, ones that she had unfortunately missed, but this was different. Many would come to see him and that of course would mean publicity for her work. Especially considering that he worked for her. Forget the fire ruby. If this worked out as she imagined, Rodney would have paid her back a hundred times over. </p><p><i>‘I’ll have to make something truly special to repay him,’</i> she thought losing herself to the moment. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sweet Apple Acres]=========</p></div><p>“And yeh sure he ain’t a monkey?”</p><p>“Course Ah’m sure, Granny Smith,” Applejack replied, feeling slightly irritated. “Ah know what a monkey looks like, and he ain’t one.” </p><p>“Hmmm….” The old pony hummed as she brought the newspaper closer. “Sure looks like one.”</p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes and went back to finishing her breakfast. “You haven't spent any time together, have ya?” she asked her older sibling as he read a different part of the paper. </p><p>“Nope,” the large red stallion answered in his trademark stoic tone.</p><p>“Well you should!” shouted Applebloom with a smile. “Ah think you’ll like him. Ah really hope he gets better.” </p><p>“You ain’t got nothin to worry about Applebloom,” Applejack assured. “He’ll be fit as a fiddle in a few days.”</p><p>“Let’s give him a ‘get well’ present!” </p><p>“Like?”</p><p>Applebloom tapped her muzzle, thinking. “Free apples for life?” Big Macintosh nearly choked on his breakfast as he started coughing loudly.</p><p>“Free might be a tad bit too much there Applebloom,” Applejack spoke with a hesitant smile. “How’s about a private discount instead?”</p><p>“And a basket of apples!” </p><p>“And a basket of apples too,” Applejack conceded. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sugarcube Corner]=========</p></div><p>“Uhm, Pinkie,” Mr.Cake called hesitantly. “What are you baking?”</p><p>“Oh I’m glad you asked! It’s my ‘Thank You For Saving Ponyville’ cupcake!” the pink pony replied hyperactively, all the while keeping an eye on a nearby oven. </p><p>“I see.” Mr.Cake gazed around the kitchen, particularly noting the many large empty bags of sugar strewn across the floor. “And exactly how many batches are you making?”</p><p>“Oh no this is a very special cupcake for a very special somepony. Though I suppose he’s not a pony, so should I call him somerodney or somehuman? Unless of course he-”</p><p>“Hold on,” Mr.Cake interrupted, “you’re only making one?” He looked again at the empty sacks of sugar. He counted eight of them on the floor. “Don’t you think that’s-”</p><p>DING!</p><p>“Oh my gosh, it’s done, it’s done, it’s done!” With large pink oven mittens Pinkie pulled the cake out of the oven, turned, and revealed her creation. “It’s PERFECT!!”</p><p>“I...eh. It’s...” Mr.Cake was at a loss for words. Rather than a pastry, this was more like a block of sugar, shaped to look like a cupcake. He could feel his bowels shudder in fear at the thought of digesting this sweetened death sentence. Even the air seem to taste sweeter. </p><p>“Pinkie, I don’t think-” he started, hoping to save a life. </p><p>“You’re right! It still needs my super special frosting!” In a blur of pink the mare darted towards the other corner of the bakery. </p><p>“Wait! Pinkie, that’s not what I...” He paused, dumbfounded by what he saw. Next to a large mixing bowl full of frosting lay even more empty sacks of sugar stacked atop each other. “Oh Celestia…”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Canterlot]=========</p></div><p>“I wish he would be slightly more subtle about keeping his origins secretive.” Celestia paused and considered while sipping on her morning tea. “But definitely better than what we expected, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>“As they say nowadays; speak for thyself.” Luna sighed heavily. She could only imagine the grievance this article would bring for her. “I can already hear the ruffling of quills from a great many protesting mails.”</p><p>Celestia giggled at Luna’s predicament. “You have to give him credit for using the media to get what he wants. Besides, did his actions not more than deserve a prize?”</p><p>“Of course they did,” Luna answered. “I had every intent on rewarding him. I even called for a gryphon to cook the feast properly. Leave it to a meat eater to cook for a meat eater.”</p><p>“I’m sure he’ll enjoy that. Even more so if he believes his plan worked.”</p><p>Luna grumbled something under her breath before turning and trotting away to her chambers.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Golden Oak Library]=========</p></div><p>“This is...,” Twilight paused as she quickly skimmed through the article. “This is good. I mean <i>really</i> good!” The newspaper descended on the table before the purple aura around it disappeared. </p><p>“I agree. Especially the last part,” Shine Bright added with the same enthusiasm. </p><p>“Knowing Rodney I expected him to… I don’t know, cause another incident or something.” Twilight’s body visibly relaxed knowing that everything was in the clear. </p><p>“Has he always caused problems?” Shine Bright asked hesitantly, fearing that perhaps her perception of the human might be mistaken. </p><p>“Not intentionally. I suppose I shouldn’t be too harsh. Most of the big ones were the result of ignorance, but sometimes he can be so...mischievous. Acting like a foal without a care in the world.” Twilight shook her head. “Most of the time he <i>knows</i> that the things he does aren’t sensible. They are counterproductive and accomplish nothing, and yet he still does them anyway.”</p><p>“I see.” Knowing she’d eventually spend a great deal of time with Rodney, Shine Bright mentally took it down. </p><p>Twilight frowned and  laid her head down on the table. “The worst part is that times during our training sessions he does things that are absolutely brilliant. It’s frustrating to see him waste his talent on whatever happens to strike his fancy.”</p><p>“So he’s gifted with magic then?”</p><p>Twilight pulled her head back up and hummed deep in thought. “Not the way somepony might expect. I mean, he does grasp the theory and practical skills of magic quite quickly, so I guess he is rather gifted. He also... thinks differently. He takes basic theoretical ideas or simple spells that every unicorn knowns and envisions them from a different angle. You’ve never seen his gems, have you?”</p><p>“His gems? You mean the arcane gem inside that box?” </p><p>“No, not that. I meant….never mind.” Twilight uttered with a sigh. “You’ll see it soon enough. It’s a project that he’s been working on for a while. Since before the dragon attack.” Twilight smiled as a thought came to her. “Let’s just say that if it works the way he explained it to me, Rodney might be sitting on very lucrative and innovative business opportunity.” </p><p>“It’s really that impressive?” Shine asked, now with great interest. </p><p>“It could change Equestria.” Twilight answered truthfully. “Don’t tell him that though. I don’t want him getting overconfident. Or worse, develop a ego.” </p><p>“Wow.” Shine didn’t know much about magic or how it’s marketing and patent system worked, but if Celestia’s student herself spoke so highly of it, then she was willing to believe it. </p><p>“Where’s Spike?” Twilight asked, noticing Spike’s absence from the table. </p><p>“Over here!” came a shout from the large circular room of the library, followed by a few chirps. “I’m about to take Peewee out on her-BUUUUURP!”</p><p>“Letter?” Twilight yelled and waited for a response, but for a while all she could hear was Peewee’s impatient chirping. “Spike?” she called. </p><p>“Uh, Twilight.” Spike walked nervously into the kitchen holding a scroll in front of him for Twilight to see. It was obvious to her that this letter did not come from Celestia. Instead of the usual trademark red band, this one was white and bore a different seal.</p><p>Silence followed suit. The only sound that could be heard was Peewee’s insistent chirping and Shine’s movement as she looked back and forth from the two confusedly. “What’s going on?” she asked worriedly. </p><p>“Nothing good,” Spike answered cryptically as Twilight levitated the scroll from him. </p><p>“What does <i>he</i> want?,” Twilight asked in an irritated tone.</p><p>Shine moved towards Spike while watching Twilight as she ripped the seal off in a clear display of hostility. “What’s going on?” she asked again. </p><p>“Only one other pony can send letters through me; The Professor.” Both Shine and Spike watched as Twilight started ranting under her breath while unfurling the letter.  </p><p>“It doesn’t look like she likes him,” Shine commented noting the unicorns obvious scorn. “Did something happen between the two of you?”</p><p>“More like what didn’t happen,” Spike answered.</p><p>“What!?” Twilight suddenly yelled before crumbling the letter into a tiny ball and throwing it into the trashcan. </p><p>“What did he want?” Spike asked, moving aside as Twilight trotted angrily out of the kitchen. </p><p>“He’s coming to stay here for a few days.” she yelled. “And he’s even bringing a guest!”</p><p>“Should I- ,” shine began thinking of finding a different place to sleep. </p><p>“No.” Twilight interrupted in a tone that left no room for argument. “You stay. There’s no need for you to move just for him. I’ll reorganize the place to make room.” Spike and Shine watched as Twilight climbed up the stairs, hooves thumping loudly along the way. </p><p>“So what happened?”</p><p>Spike sighed and rolled his eyes. “He’s never given her a perfect grade on anything.”</p>

<p>Ok I’ll admit it; I’m starting to slip. More than a month since the last update. It’s old but my job got really complicated, for those in the gaming industry we are now in crunch time. </p><p>Anyways, I’ll get to the main plot after this chapter. I just wanted to address some of the effects and result of the interview. Plus it was fun writing those small segments. Apologies to Rainbow and Fluttershy fans for not including them. At least not here. </p><p>And of course, the awesome newspaper article goes to Hollyhock. I’m lucky to get such a talented editor/artist. </p><p>Anyways, let’s also welcome AndyGrey as my additional editor. When he doesn’t edit, he complains and points out everything that’s wrong about my writing. So he’s actually helping me become a better writer. </p><p>Again, I’m lucky. </p><p>Hope you all enjoyed the chapter. I’ll try, <i>try</i> to write up the next one faster. </p><p>Oh! Also please tell me if there's any trouble reading the article on a smartphone or any mobile device. Since the whole things is actually a picture, you may have trouble reading it. Depends on the resolution. I'll try to figure something out to help you.</p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Halloween Special<br/><b>Edited by:</b><br/>Alejandro-A.K.A-Alex-A.K.A-Hollyhock<br/>Andy Grey<br/><b>Pre-read by:</b><br/>Hollyhock, Andy Grey</p><p>AN: Holly, if you're going to turn the chapter info block into your own personal message at least tell me. </p><hr/><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[7 days till Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>“Nightmare….Night?” I asked with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>“It’s next week,” Redheart answered. “You’re not familiar with it?” I shook my head. </p><p>“It’s a night festival,” Bronze clarified. He watched as Redheart continued to wrap bandages soaked in medicine around my midsection. “Everypony wears costumes, there are game stalls at the town center, and the kids gallop around demanding sweets.” Bronze shook his head irritably. “As if they didn’t have enough energy already.”</p><p><i>‘So...halloween?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Considering all the other similarities this world has to ours, this is probably something we should’ve expected.’</span></p><p>“And here I thought you’d enjoy a reason to celebrate and intoxicate yourself,” Redheart continued. “Hands please.” I complied and raised both arms to a ninety degree angle to make her work easier. </p><p>“On the contrary I do enjoy it. The problem is that I can’t join in the festivities,” Bronze answered irritably. “I only open the bar after hours, and since everything starts at night there’s hardly any customers to make it worthwhile.”</p><p>“How does that stop you? Sounds like a perfect reason to close the shop and join the fun,” she asked confused. “Down.” I slowly brought my arms down, being careful not to move my fractured rib.</p><p>“Because of the kids!” Bronze dropped his head into his hooves in dismay. “You know how they are, always curious about everything, poking their muzzles in places they don’t belong. Especially if everypony tells them not to.”</p><p>“Ah don’t fohow,” Redheart spoke while biting the end of the bandage. She pulled on them causing me to grunt slightly when the bindings pressed against my ribs. “I don’t follow,” she repeated.</p><p>“Sometimes I get kids trying to sneak into my bar,” Bronze sighed. “Most times as a game or a dare. With all the sugar and the festivities, I have more kids trying to break in than any other time of the year. Which is why I can’t ever leave my bar alone.” The pegasus grumbled something under his breath before continuing. “Especially from these two colts, Snips and Snails I think they’re called. They got in their heads that drinking my stuff will help ’em grow older.”</p><p>“Why would they want-” Redheart was about to asked before Bronze interrupted. </p><p>“Something about getting beards or some such. I don’t know!” Bronze waved his forehooves exasperatedly in the air. “I just wish they’d all stop!”</p><p>“Locking up the bar’s not enough?” I asked, joining in on the conversation. </p><p>“What, and risk one of them actually getting in!? No way. Half the ponies in town are into the whole prohibition thing. If a kid gets drunk because I left the bar unguarded, you can kiss the Bronze Sky goodbye.”</p><p>“What are you gonna do this year then?” I asked. “You’re stuck here.”</p><p>“Ah don’t worry. Luckily I got lazy and haven’t ordered or made any new supplies. All the tankards are drier than the desert.”</p><p>“Wait, you named the bar after yourself?” Redheart asked, surprised. Which probably meant she’d never visited.</p><p>“Yeah he did,” I answered with a laugh.</p><p>“It’s a good name!”</p><p>We continued conversing about the festival, mostly explaining to me what goes on and what’s traditional. From what I’d learned, it was almost a perfect duplication of Halloween. Of course I never shared this with them, it would raise more question about where I came from. The only one I’d be able to tell would be Twilight. </p><p>I was however, quite interested to learn that the element of fright and scare from Halloween was also present in Nightmare Night. </p><p>Which got me thinking.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[6 days till Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>“Rodney!”</p><p>“Ah!” I flinched as three high pitched voices assaulted my ears. I looked to the door just in time to see Sweetie Belle and Applebloom galloping towards me with Scootaloo trailing behind on her scooter.  All three came to a halt right next to the bed and stared up at me with their usual cheery faces. </p><p>“Whatcha doing?” they asked in perfect sync. </p><p>“Research,” I answered, lifting the thick textbook for them to see. “What are you three doing here?” I looked towards the door expecting Rarity or another caretaker to follow them inside. “You three alone?”</p><p>“Yeah, everypony’s busy fixing everything,” Applebloom answered. </p><p>“We’re not even allowed to go crusading for our construction cutie marks,” Scootaloo complained. “We know how to use power tools.” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘That’s not worrying at all.’</span></p><p>“Where’s uhm...” Sweetie Belle asked, noticing the empty bed across the room. </p><p>“Bronze? Gone to stretch his legs I think. So what are you guys doing here?” </p><p>“Oh right, what’s yer costume for Nightmare Night?” Applebloom asked expectantly. </p><p>I raised an eyebrow. “Costume?”</p><p>“Yeah you know, what you’ll dress up as,” Scootaloo explained in a, ‘didn’t you know,’ kind of tone. </p><p>“I don’t think I’ll be going out for Nightmare Night,” I answered. I immediately regretted my answer as all three pairs of ears flopped down in dismay. </p><p>“But there’s candy.”</p><p>“And games.”</p><p>“Even Princess Luna will come.” </p><p>“Wait, Luna’s coming to Ponyville?” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah, just like last year,” Scootaloo informed. The idea of Luna being in town made a certain idea ever more enticing. </p><p>“So you’re going right?” Sweetie Belle looked at me expectantly with a big smile. </p><p>I let out a sigh. “Sorry Sweets but it’s not up to me. I can barely move as it is right now.” Again their ear’s fell flat against their heads. “Buuuuut, that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy Nightmare Night from here.”</p><p>“Huh?” I laughed when all three of their heads tilted to the side in confusion. </p><p>I leaned in over the side and whispered, “Well-”</p><p>“What are you fillies doing here?” All four of us turned to the door to see a nurse looking into the room. “Come now, you shouldn’t be disturbing the patients.” With a disapproving gaze the nurse pointed down the hallway with a hoof, gesturing to the three to exit the room. </p><p>“Sweetie Belle, ask Rarity if she has any spare gems that I can have,” I quickly spoke. “It doesn’t have to be anything special or big. As many as you can get.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“You three out now,” the nurse repeated in a harsher tone. The three turned and quickly trotted out of the room, briefly pausing in front of the nurse to apologize before disappearing around the corner. </p><p>“Remember!” I yelled. “Nothing special!” With that, the nurse closed the door and left me alone in silence. </p><p>I closed the book I was reading and placed it on the side for later. Next to it was the pile of other books Twilight had brought from the library. I ran a finger over the spines of each book, trying to find one in particular that had once caught my eye.  </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>Popular Theatrical Spells For The Novice Showpony - By Glare Light</p></div><p>“There you are.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[5 days till Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>“So everyone’s got one right?”</p><p>“Well maybe not everypony,” Bronze answered offhandedly. Or offhoofedly, I suppose.</p><p>“But most do have gems attached for light, correct?”</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe? It’s not like I go around town entering homes and looking at their bathroom mirrors.” He gazed up from his lunch tray to look at me in suspicion. “What’s this about anyways?”</p><p>I shrugged innocently. “Nothing, I’m curious is all.” </p><p>“Well that’s a rather odd sort of curiosity you got there. Got a bit of a fetish for ponies in bathrooms?” he teased. </p><p>“What?! Eww no!” I immediately responded.  </p><p>“Don’t worry your secret’s safe with me,” he teased again. I responded by casting a weak levitation spell on his sandwich, enough to make it spontaneously ignite. It startled him so much that he actually threw the sandwich up into the air, at which point gravity took over making it and it’s contents fall all over him. “That’s not funny!” he shouted angrily, a slice of tomato hanging by his ear.</p><p>It took a few moments for my laughter to die down before I could reply properly. “I-I beg to differ.” I kept on laughing even after he got up from bed and made his way towards the bathroom to clean himself up. </p><p>I never actually planned on making him go there because of it. Having the sandwich fall on him was just pure luck. I’d already done what I could with the spell, which was simple enough to keep a secret. All I had to do was lock myself in the bathroom periodically and work while pretending to have a stomach ache. Now all I needed was a test subject, and it looked like I was about to get it. </p><p><i>‘Here we go.’</i> I watched as Bronze went in and closed the door. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Let’s hope all that effort pays off.’</span></p><p><i>‘I need to test it out eventually, it’s meant for ponies so...’</i> If everything works as it’s meant to, the spell should activate when Bronze tries turning the light gem on. Silence fell and I strained my ears to listen, when finally….</p><p>“AAAH!!” A few second later the bathroom door burst open, slamming into the wall with a loud bang. Bronze stumbled frantically  shuffling out like a bat out of hell, even slipping and face planting the floor at one point with that same tomato slice still dangling around his ear. Luckily the cast was sturdy enough to prevent him from further injuring his broken wing. </p><p>“'Celestia's beard! What was that?!” he yelled, eyes wide open. </p><p>“Oh god! I-ow! I-it ow! It hurts!” I held my hand over my fractured rib, trying my best to control my laughter but to no avail. With my rib and all the aching muscles, every breath was accompanied by a flare of pain. </p><p>“Was that you!?” he shouted with a hoof pointed at me as I laughed out loud. “Did you do that!?”</p><p>“What is going on in there!” someone shouted from the doorway. Both of us turned to see Redheart glaring at us like a mother catching her kids with their hands in cookie jar. “You two should be resting! Not...,” Redheart paused when she saw Bronze, “...whatever this is!”</p><p>“It’s his fault!” Bronze balmed, pointing his hoof at me again. All I could do was laugh and wince in pain with every breath. Even Redheart’s barrage of scolding wasn't enough to quell my laughter. </p><p>The spell was ready, now I just needed to work on the delivery.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[3 days till Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>Rainbow hovered outside the window, and looked at me with a bewildered face. “You want me to what now?” </p><p>“Go around town and see if you can find any open windows or some opening,” I repeated.</p><p>“Why?” she asked in a tone soaked with suspicion. I couldn’t really blame her. If anyone was within earshot of our conversation they’d think we were planning a robbery or something, or that at least I was. </p><p>“Easy, I’m not planning anything. Well no I am, but it’s nothing bad I promise. I just recently heard that you’re quite the prankster.” </p><p>One of Rainbow’s eyebrow rose. “What about it?” she asked, now interested. </p><p>It was important that I get her to help me, which meant appealing to her personality. “I plan on creating a legend. Something Ponyville won’t be forgetting anytime soon. You interested?”</p><p>“What kind of a legend?” She flew through the open window and allowed herself to fall on one of the large pillows they use to sit. </p><p>“I won’t spoil it, and I don’t want to risk you blabbing about it before it’s time.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna-”</p><p>“But,” I interrupted, “I promise you it will be memorable.”</p><p>Rainbow rubbed a hoof against her chin in thought. “Let’s say I’ll help; exactly what do you want me to do?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Hook, line, and sinker. Nicely done.’</span></p><p>From the other side of the bed, hidden from Rainbow’s view, I levitated a bag filled with various gems that Sweetie Belle brought two days before. It was filled with a good amount of small to medium sized gems, with flaws ranging from failed cuts to cracks and impurities that made them unfit for commercial use. </p><p>In other words, garbage.</p><p>Though there were some really nice cuts in there that stood out from among the rest which I removed and kept. Knowing Rarity and her tendency to give stuff away, she probably added them in spite of what I had asked for. </p><p>“Here.” I levitated the bag to the cyan pegasus who immediately peered inside to inspect the contents. “I need you to throw one of those though every open window, or anything that offers access to a mirror.”</p><p>Rainbow looked at me with a perplexed expression. “You want me to throw junk inside ponies’ homes?”</p><p>“Oh but they're not junk, not currently at least.” Rainbow gave the bag an unconvinced look. “Look, if you see any mirror, big or small, that has one of those light gems attached to it. Just throw one of these as close to it as you can.”</p><p>“This doesn’t sound like any prank I know.”</p><p>“That’s because it’s an original,” I replied confidently. “So you in?”</p><p>Rainbow stared at the bag for a few moments before turning her attention to the other pegasus in the room. “What do you think?”</p><p>Bronze, who had been keeping silent throughout the conversation, gave her a shrug. “Up to you kid. From what I know it’s not really hurting anypony.”</p><p>Rainbow rubbed her chin again in thought. “Ok,” she finally concluded. “I’ll do it. Just throw one in, right?”</p><p>“That’s right,” I answered with a big smile. “Oh hold on.” I grabbed a small folded piece of paper from the table next to the bed and handed it to Rainbow. “You need to read that to the gem before you throw it in.”</p><p>“Command li-”</p><p>“Ah!” I yelled, surprising her before she could finish reading the key words. “Don’t say it until you’re ready. And make sure that you whisper it. Don’t let the other gems hear you or they’ll activate.”</p><p>“Activate?” she asked, somewhat nervous now. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it won’t hurt anyone. But, uhm, maybe steer clear of Fluttershy’s place. Now go! Nightmare Night is only a few days away.” I shooed her with both hands towards the window. She gave the bag another hesitant glance before unfolding her wings and flying out the window, leaving behind a short gust of wind that ruffled the room. </p><p>“I was right, right?” Bronze asked after he and I watched Rainbow disappear into the distance. “This won’t hurt anypony? You haven’t actually explained anything about what I saw in there.”</p><p>“And I said I’ll explain it all at Nightmare Night.” I replied dismissively. “I want to keep it a surprise and with this we can enjoy the festive spirit from here.”</p><p>“Hmm,” he mumbled irritably before laying back and taking another nap. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Two down, one to go.’</span></p><p><i>‘Now we just need the legend.’</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Day before Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>“Are you sure you can’t come with us?” Sweetie Belle looked at me with puppy dog eyes, puckered lips, and folded ears. She was maxing out on all levels of her d’aww powers and they were all aimed right at me. As if that wasn’t enough, the other two fillies were doing the same thing next to her.</p><p>“We promise to behave,” Applebloom beged. </p><p>“You can have half-no a third...well maybe a quarter of our candies,” Scootaloo added, hoping to bribe me somehow. </p><p>My heart was about to explode, melt, and explode again. Humans just aren’t meant to handle this much cuteness. Bronze was no help either. In fact he was enjoying my torment with a large grin plastered across his face as he watched from the comfort of his bed, most likely getting some payback for the prank I pulled. </p><p>Fortunately self preservation seems to outdo the powers of d’aww. I could barely walk to the bathroom as it is, I probably wouldn’t survive a night watching over three fillies galloping all over town. Especially these three. </p><p>“I’m sorry girls but-” Out of nowhere each of them summoned a single tear, immediately making me feel like I was the bad guy. “But I just can’t.” I could feel something in me wrinkle and die as I watched their faces turn to disappointment.  </p><p>Strangely, they looked at each other confused. </p><p>“It didn’t work,” Sweetie Belle whispered. Or tried to anyways. </p><p>“But it always works,” argued Apple Bloom. </p><p>“Maybe if we cry a bit more,” Scootaloo suggested which of course made me realize the whole thing had been a ploy to play on my feelings. </p><p>“Were you three trying to manipulate me?” I asked, more surprised than anything else. To think they’d turn their their adorableness into a weapon, and from the sound of it they’d already used it before to get their way. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Let’s not underestimate these three again.’</span></p><p>Bronze bellowed out a hearty laugh. “Well, you can’t blame them for trying!” </p><p>“<i>Why</i> are you trying so hard?” I asked them.</p><p>“I think I know,” Bronze spoke before either of them could. “I heard from one of the nurses that all the colts and fillies are to spend Nightmare Night strictly in the town center. With all the construction work going on they didn’t want any accidents happening. I’m thinking these three were planning to-”</p><p>“Show me off,” I finished following his thought. I turned and looked at the fillies with an accusing glare. “Is that true?”</p><p>“What!? Of course not?” Sweetie Belle replied in a fashion that closely resembled Rarity’s over exuberant behaviour. </p><p>“We would never do that!” shouted Applebloom.</p><p>“Good ponies don’t show off,” Scootaloo spoke in an obvious sort of tone. </p><p>I looked at them suspiciously with a raised brow for several moments as the room fell into silence. When suddenly….</p><p>“Oh please, please, please!” Sweetie Belle begged aloud. </p><p>“You’ve gotta come!” Applebloom shouted louder than before.</p><p>“PUHLEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS!!” Scootaloo wailed.</p><p>“Hey hey HEY!” I reached out and levitated each filly a few inches into the air, catching them off guard and silencing them. “Don’t start screaming or you’ll get kicked out again,” I warned, as I put them back to the floor. I had some trouble suppressing an urge to smile. </p><p>“So will you come?” Sweetie Belle asked. </p><p>I let out a sigh. “The answers is still no.” All three dipped their heads down in disappointment. “Like I said, it’s not about my choice, I just-wait a minute.” Their ears shot up straight expectantly. “All the kids will be at this gathering?”</p><p>“Yup,” answered Apple Bloom. </p><p>“I’m guessing there’ll be activities right?” Already I could feel Bronze’s gaze fall on me suspiciously. </p><p>“Of course,” Scootaloo responded. “We’ll take turns playing the stalls, gather candy from everypony, and tell stories with-”</p><p>“Scary stories?” </p><p>“Of course, it’s called Nightmare Night for a reason,” Scootaloo answered. </p><p><i>‘Oh this is just too perfect!’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Its almost like it’s meant to be.’</span></p><p>“What are you-” Bronze started to ask before I raised a hand and gave him a wink. With a slight snort he shut his mouth and relaxed back into his bed. </p><p>“Alright girls, I may not be able to go with you, but I can still make this Nightmare Night one you’ll remember.” They trotted closer with anticipation right next to my bed. “How’s about I tell you girls a story that nobody has ever heard of, hmm? A scary one.”</p><p>“This better one really scary story,” Scootaloo spoke unconvinced. </p><p>“Oh ho ho ho, this isn’t just any scary story.” I smiled devilishly. “It’s a scary <i>true</i> story.” Yeah I knew I had lied, one of the girls would probably give me a scolding when they found out. But at the moment I couldn’t care less, not with the knowledge that my plan was coming together oh-so perfectly.</p><p>I rubbed my hands together like an evil genius. “This is the tale of the Bloody Mare...” </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Nightmare Night]=========</p></div><p>“Alright children,” called Cheerilee. “That’s enough of that.” Her call was ignored however as the fillies and colts continued to circle and play with the dark alicorn. “Children!” she called again louder. </p><p>“‘Tis quite alright,” replied the alicorn in between giggles. “Such merriment is the very purpose of a festival.” </p><p>“Me next! Me next!” shouted a colt, gleefully hopping about in place. With a smile Luna complied and lifted the colt with a spell, making him float in circles above the heads of other eagerly awaiting fillies and colts. </p><p>The entire courtyard was buzzing with activity, voices, and cries of fright in celebration of Nightmare Night. Young and old were enjoying themselves with the many games, hot food, and each other’s company. Despite all that had happened, the ponies of Ponyville still managed to set the event up and enjoy themselves. Even those sent to help repair the town were joining in on the merriment, some even wore costumes made by residents as a small thank you. </p><p>It was a wonderful sight to see, one that had a cerise colored mare constantly smiling all night. </p><p>“Miss Cheerilee?” The mare turned around to see three of her students standing behind her. </p><p>“Yes Sweetie...” Her voice trailed off as she tried to comprehend their costumes. As much as she tried, the schoolteacher couldn’t figure out what they were dressed up as. Each wore something similar to the other yet it looked unfinished. </p><p>“When is story time?” asked Sweetie Belle.</p><p>Cheerilee glanced up at the clocktower. “In about a minute,” she answered. “Uhm, girls. What are you three dressed up as?”</p><p>Applebloom’s ears perked up. “Oh, hold on.”</p><p>Cheerilee watched slightly worried as the three fillies started clambering on top of each other; Applebloom at the bottom, Scootaloo over her, and Sweetie Belle on top. Cheerilee knew that the earth filly often tended the apple farm with her family and possessed more muscle than most fillies or colts her age, but it was still surprising to see her carry the weight of both her friends. </p><p>“Tadah!” they yelled in unison, wobbling slightly as they tried to keep their balance. </p><p>“It’s..uh...” Cheerilee tilted her head, hoping a different angle might help. She could tell that all three costumes came together like a puzzle, but still she couldn’t tell what they were supposed to be. Applebloom wore something that was mostly dark, Scootaloo had a blueish drape over her, while Sweetie Belle wore a mask of sorts with a dark patch of what looked like somepony’s dark mane atop her head. </p><p>“And what are you three supposed to be?” came an elegant voice. Cheerilee did a small jump in surprise and turned around to see the dark alicorn standing behind her. </p><p>“Princess Luna,” greeted Cheerilee respectfully before moving to the side. “These are my stu-”</p><p>“We’re Rodney!” they all squealed in unison. Luna’s eye twitched ever so slightly, enough to go unnoticed as she gazed over the trio. </p><p>“Are you now?” Luna replied trying her best to keep her smile genuine. </p><p>“She doesn’t see it,” spoke Scootaloo disappointed. </p><p>“I told you we needed stilts for his legs,” replied Sweetie Belle.</p><p>“And sticks for...his arms,” Applebloom added in a strained voice. </p><p>“No, of course I see it,” Luna quickly corrected. “It’s certainly original, I don’t think anypony’s ever tried dressing up as a human.” She guessed they had tried to mimic the human’s attire, though unfortunately the colors were the only resemblance, that and the dark patch of hair. Luna of course never mentioned this, unable to find it in herself to disappoint them.</p><p>“Alright children!” Cheerilee yelled out. “Gather around! It’s story time!”</p><p>In a shuffle of movement the three got off from each other, or rather tumbled from each other, as they quickly joined the other children near a large bonfire at the center of the courtyard. There were a few caretakers in the group, mostly just to keep an eye on the children and make sure they didn’t wander off. </p><p>“Alright then,” Cheerilee started once everypony made a large circle. To her surprise Princess Luna was also seated at the side, surrounded by children. A pair of toddlers were even dancing through her mane and giggling while in their diapers. That is until the Cakes hurriedly took them away and apologized repeatedly. </p><p>“Now then,” she continued, “tonight’s story will be-”</p><p>“We have a story!!” screamed a loud and high pitched voice, causing everypony’s ears to fold away. Before anypony could say anything, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo had already moved to the center while keeping a distance from the bonfire. </p><p>“Well,” Cheerilee pondered for a moment.</p><p>“Oh let them, I’m sure it’ll be frightful,” Luna spoke with a smile. She, like everypony else, expected them to tell one of the more popular Nightmare Night stories or perhaps even reenact one. </p><p>Each filly gave each other a quick glance and a nod before taking in a breath, and began their tale.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>There once was a mare,</p><p>She was blessed with beauty.</p><p>Golden mane that made all stare,</p><p>Eyes that burned like rubies.</p><p>There once was a mare,</p><p>She was admired by many.</p><p>With jealous ones to spare,</p><p>Enough to turn deadly.</p><p>Beautiful Mare they called,</p><p>Come with us and play.</p><p>Oblivious she followed,</p><p>In the forest led astray.</p><p>Beautiful Mare they called,</p><p>Let’s play hide and seek.</p><p>Deep in the forest she concealed,</p><p>Where they left her in sneak.</p><p>Lost Mare, they shouted,</p><p>Where are you hiding.</p><p>High and low they scouted,</p><p>With the night air chilling.</p><p>Lost Mare they cried,</p><p>Found a gruesome sight.</p><p>Golden mane defiled,</p><p>Ruby eyes torn apart.</p><p>Bloody Mare they now call her,</p><p>A horrid mare disfigured.</p><p>Bloody Mare they now fear,</p><p>With crimson tears she cried.</p><p>Bloody Mare they called no more,</p><p>Her home to silence fell.</p><p>Bloody Mare no more,</p><p>A hanging corpse on her mirror wall.</p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN:Further edited by Hrafn. Thanks man.]</p></div><p>Silence fell over the entire courtyard, even those that were playing the stalls had stopped and listen in. They looked at the three fillies with mixed expressions, some horror, worry, apprehension. Even Luna was rather taken aback, she has of course heard countless horrific stories and this was nothing special. But the fact that it came from ones so young was hard to accept. </p><p>“Where, pray tell,” Luna started breaking the silence, “did you three hear such a tale?”</p><p>“Rodney told us,” Sweetie Belle answered innocently. </p><p>“Of course he did,” Luna spoke under her breath. </p><p>“He said it was based on a true story,” Apple Bloom added. </p><p>“No way that story is true!” yelled another filly from the side. Diamond Tiara took a step towards them from the ring of ponies followed by Silver Spoon. “It’s as bad as your costumes.”</p><p>“Is too, and our costume is awesome!” Scootaloo yelled back. </p><p>“Where’s your proof?” Silver Spoon asked, egging her on. </p><p>“Simple,” Sweetie Belle answered. “Go to your bathroom, call Bloody Mare three times and she’ll appear.”</p><p>Off away at a distance, atop a dense black cloud, a pair of cyan ears perked up at attention. Remembering her task from Rodney, Rainbow Dash made an ‘Oh’ expression realizing the human’s ploy. </p><p>“Why would anypony do something stupid like that?” Diamond retorted. </p><p>“What are you? Chikun?” Apple Bloom teased. </p><p>“Girls that’s enough!” Cheerilee scolded. “Remember the Princess is here, we should be on our best behaviour.”</p><p>“You believe us don’tcha Princess?” Apple Bloom asked. Just like that everypony’s attention fell to the dark alicorn while she was pondering what punishment she should give the human next. </p><p>“Well,” Luna started as she carefully planned her answer. “If what you say is true, then one simply does the deed to know the truth. Correct?” If Rodney did indeed claim the story was true and raised the fillies’ expectation, then it falls unto him to mend their disappointment. </p><p>Several murmurs spread throughout the crowd along with an excited giggle as a dark cloud flew away.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[A few hours later]=========</p></div><p>“Good night Daisy,” Rose spoke as she and Lily waved goodbye. </p><p>“Goodnight girls,” Daisy replied before entering her home. As soon as she stepped in the house the magenta mare let out an exhausted sigh and removed her costume. </p><p><i>‘I’ll deal with it tomorrow,’</i> she thought, leaving the costume in a pile near the door. As she moved towards the stairs her eyes caught the newspaper sitting on a small table against the wall. Her cheeks reddened remembering the human’s message for her, she knew it was likely another tease but she couldn’t help but feel slightly happy at the thought of somepony finding her attractive. </p><p>Shaking her head to get rid of that thought, Daisy climbed the stairs with her bed in mind. She enjoyed this year’s Nightmare Night more than she had expected to, but it left her exhausted. However, instead of heading straight to her bedroom, Daisy stood still for a moment to sniff herself. The combination of external activities and a stifling costume left her with a less than pleasant odor. Not wanting to sleep in such a state and befoul her bed, she decided a quick bath was in order. </p><p>Daisy’s bathroom was quite simple, the white walls and the appliances were the same as when she first moved in. So long as everything worked she had little reason to replace anything. The only item that she had added was an oval mirror nailed to the wall, just tall enough to do herself proper. </p><p>“Light,” she spoke in a very flat and clear tone. A second later a small gem atop the oval mirror burst into light causing her to flinch against the sudden glare. Unlike most modern homes with gems built into the ceilings and walls for light, the residents of Ponyville had to purchase various appliances to light their homes for the night. </p><p>Once her eyes adjusted to the light, Daisy moved next to her tub and adjusted the temperature of the water before turning it on. Watching the steaming water flow out, Daisy quickly changed her mind about the shower and decided to go for a long and relaxing bath. While waiting for the tub to fill she went for the cupboard under the sink for one of her favorite scented bath salts. </p><p>Crack!</p><p>Daisy quickly lifted her hoof off the floor to see a small pebble laying on the floor. Kicking it away she caught sight of herself in the mirror which made her remember the three infamous fillies and their dreadful story. </p><p><i>‘What were they thinking?’</i> she thought. <i>‘Sure it’s Nightmare Night but that was just dark. The poem wasn’t even that good, clearly the work of an amatuer. Not even.’</i> Remembering that moment also brought to mind how it was supposedly based on a true story. </p><p>“Can’t be,” she mumbled, staring at her counterpart in the mirror. For several seconds Daisy just stood there staring into the mirror with the constant sound of running water. “It can’t be real,” she mumbled again. </p><p>Daisy suddenly shook her head. “This is stupid,” she spoke to herself, turning around and trotting towards her bath with the salts. But as much as she tried to forget, the thought of attempting the call kept poking at the back of her mind. </p><p><i>‘Am I actually scared of a child’s story?’</i> That was the thought that finally pushed her. Placing the salts down on the floor, Daisy turned and faced the mirror once again. <i>‘Three times was it?’</i> She took a deep breath.</p><p>“Bloody Mare,” she spoke clearly and confidently. Daisy waited and looked around to find everything was the same. </p><p>“Bloody Mare.” As she spoke the gem immediately started to flicker causing her to jump back and lean against the wall. A few seconds later the light returned to normal, bathing the room in constant light as if nothing had happened. </p><p>“It’s nothing, probably just needs a recharge.” </p><p>She had half a mind to just dive into the tub and soak in the relaxing water, but her pride wouldn’t let her. She had gone this far and she was not about to let fillies mess with her head. She stepped forward, stare into herself and with a firm voice she called thrice. </p><p>“Bloody Mare.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/847698543e229e19f64d729d251d5d081e603cc4?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs12.postimg.org%2Fsdzxla34d%2Fbloma.jpg" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Ponyville Hospital]=========</p></div><p>“And here we go,” I spoke under my breath as a scream echoed from Ponyville. </p><p>I sat on the window sill with the cold night wind blowing against me. My body was shivering, but I wasn’t really bothered with the cold. Not with the anticipation of seeing the all of my planning and effort come to fruition. Though I suppose ‘hearing’ was a more accurate term, seeing as I was still stuck in the hospital. </p><p>“That’s it?” Bronze spoke unimpressed. “How could you even know if that was-” another screamed echoed from the town. </p><p>“Can’t say I know for certain,” I answered truthfully. I turned my gaze away from the pegasus and gazed at the glowing town once again. “But you don’t scream like that just from being startled. That’s a ‘shit myself’ level of scream.”</p><p>Both of us waited in silence as more screams was heard off in the distance. Each making me smile ear to ear with an odd sense of pride. </p><p>“So are you going to start explaining everything or should I beat it out of you?” Bronze asked, clearly still upset with the prank I had pulled on him earlier. </p><p>Even though I wished to remain seated by the window and hear the rewarding screams, I did promise to explain. Reluctantly I got up and walked slowly towards the stack of books next to my bed and grabbed one from the top of the pile. </p><p>“Here.” I threw the book at him which was engulfed in blue fire midflight, slowing down to a halt before it stopped right in front of Bronze.  </p><p>“Popular Theatrical Spells For The Novice Showpony,” he read aloud as he took the book with a hoof. “That thing was a spell?”</p><p>“More like an enchantment.” I pointed to the book with a nod. “Most of the stuff is about creating special effects. Bending light, creating sound and stuff for performances.”</p><p>“So what I saw in the mirror...”</p><p>“Was nothing more than an illusion. Actually, I wouldn’t even go as far to call it that. All I did was mess around with your reflection. Just enough distortion to make it look like somebody else was in there with you,” I explained briefly.</p><p>“That was my reflection?” He asked not quite ready to believe. “What’s with all the red then? Kinda made it look like-”</p><p>“Bleeding?” I cut in. “That’s the point. Remember that story I told the fillies? Bloody Mare?”</p><p>“And how did you-” he started before I answered the obvious question. </p><p>“The book teaches you how to play around with light, I just tuned it more towards the red spectrum. To make the blood more pronounced I concentrated the distortion in certain areas while making the red stronger.” I grabbed the small mirror Rarity left for me and traced it along the edges with a burning finger, enchanting it with the same spell as the one I used to scare him. “Here,” I threw the burning mirror at the edge of his bed so as to not hit him. “Take a quick look at that before the magic fades away.”</p><p>Hesitantly Bronze pulled the mirror using his good wing and flipped it over. Knowing what to expect, Bronze hardly even twitched as he gazed into the mirror. He even moved it about at different angles much like Rarity did when applying her makeup. </p><p>“It kinda does look like me,” he commented. I watched as the fire slowly burned away indicating the rate at which the magic was dissipated from the mirror.</p><p>“But the mirror in the bathroom wasn’t burning like this. How’d you cast the spell without me knowing?”</p><p>“Ah, that’s because the one in the bathroom has a gem attached to it. I replaced the light spell with the enchantment. That way the enchantment stays inactive until someone, in this case you, tried turning the light on.”</p><p>“Ah,” was all he said, probably remembering when I had questioned him about mirrors that came with light gems attached. </p><p>Another scream could be heard in the distance and we both listened to it until it disappeared. </p><p>“The ones in town are different, though,” I continued, thrilled to explain how I pulled it off. “Remember the bag of gems I gave to Rainbow Dash?”</p><p>“Yeah I figured that’s how you spread it,” he replied before tossing the book back. Rather than catching it, I caught the book in a levitation spell, and dropped it back atop the pile. </p><p>“That, was without a doubt the hardest part,” I spoke with a sigh. “I had figure out a way to somehow package the spell into another spell, have it detect any nearby enchantments, and find one that’s an exact duplicate of the light gem in the bathroom.” I pointed towards the same bathroom Bronze jumped out of in fright. </p><p>“That’s not even the hardest part,” I continued. “The spell then has to...uhm,” I paused for a moment trying to find the right word, “<i>smuggle</i> the illusion spell. That way the illusion spell lays dormant while the light spell on the gem still works as normal.” I started laughing as I thought of the complications and different variables I had to juggle. “To be honest, I was half expecting it all to fall apart somewhere along the road. Most of the variables along the way were just guesswork. And since I’m basing the light gem from the one in the bathroom, my spell won’t work on any other variations of it.”</p><p>Both of us looked towards the open window as the echo of another scream was heard. </p><p>“And how exactly was it different?” Bronze asked. I looked at him confused. “You said the spell you had that pegasus spread was different from the one I saw.”</p><p>“Oh, right.” Talking about the difficulties of the package spell made me lose track of the topic. “Then one you saw was triggered when you tried turning the light on. But the one in town activates when the key word is repeated three times.”</p><p>“Bloody Mare,” he surmised. “From the legend you told those fillies.”</p><p>“Exactly!” The excitement of explaining it was coming back. “For the first call nothing will happen, but the spell will uhm, wake up and prepare itself. The second time it will make the light gem flicker just a bit to set the mood. On the third the spell activates, taking the image of whoever happens to be in front of the mirror and distorting it for the desired effect.”</p><p>“Hold on, doesn’t that mean every image will be different? Since it works off of the one standing in front of the mirror.”</p><p>“Yeah that would be the case.” I smiled confidently. “Unless of course no one actually gets a good look at it.”</p><p>“What are you-”</p><p>“Unlike the one you saw, the illusion everybody else sees will only appear for a split second. Enough for them to notice but not recognize. The rest is simply filled in by their imagination.” I gave him another confident smile. “I basically let their own imagination do the work for me. Rumors will spread and soon other ponies will give it a shot. Mirrors that weren’t activated will remain dormant so long as there’s magic remaining in the gem.”</p><p>Bronze looked at me as if he was seeing me in a whole new light, and then without warning, burst into a hearty laugh. “Celestia pour me a drink!” he shouted with mirth. “I think you might have created a legend!”</p><p>A wide proud smile spread across my face revealing the whites of my teeth. “There’s a saying where I come from; go big or go home.”</p><p>“HA! I love it!” Bronze bellowed with a smile that rivaled my own. “This calls for a celebration!” I watched as he bit his pillow and ripped it apart spilling cotton all over his bed. Then I saw the glint of a bottle filled with clear golden liquid hidden inside.</p><p>“How?” I asked incredulously. </p><p>“My emergency stash,” he answered smugly. Leaning to the side towards his shield, Bronze pulled out a pair of cups hidden behind it. </p><p>“You just gonna stand there gawking or are you drinking?” he asked, taking pleasure in my expression of disbelief. </p><p>I looked towards the door expecting Redheart to trot inside, before throwing caution to the wind and walking towards the pegasus. “Why the hell not!” I yelled with the same amount of mirth. </p><p>“That’s the spirit!” With his good wing holding the bottle, Bronze poured both of us a hefty amount of liquid fire. “To Nightmare Night!” he cheered. </p><p>“To Nightmare Night,” I repeated as we raised our glasses to the ceiling and gulped down their contents.</p><p>“Another!” Bronze yelled as he filled our cups. </p><p>I turned and raised my glass to the window, lining it up with the lights of Ponyville. “To Bloody Mare!”</p><p>“To Bloody Mare!” Bronze repeated with gusto. </p><p>A screamed was heard again as I felt the liquid fire burn my throat. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/b2ebf3eb96f34d53efc8731119fb75285012aab1?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs22.postimg.org%2F86i9brpdd%2FHn_H8dq_L.png" /></p></div>

<p>Let's get the obvious one out of the way, I can't write a poem or rhyme worth anything. But for the spirit of Halloween I still gave it a shot. </p><p>Now, even though the setting of this chapter takes place after chapter 38, it has no place in the overall plot of the story. Meaning the next chapter will go on as if this never happened. Good or bad that my decision on it. I did however took as much opportunity on this to further build on the lore wnd world of what I imagine Equestria to be, small stuff here and there. </p><p>Based on the comments I've received about SaF, explaining how the whole magic/spell system works in detail was what most people enjoyed. Which is why I added the various days leading up to Nightmare Night to show how Rodney actually managed to pull it all off. Hopefully it doesn't get all too confusing at the end, especially considering how rushed this chapter was in order to meet the Halloween deadline. </p><p>As for me, I'm not taking any chances with Pinkie. Especially not tonight of all nights. I've spent all day yesterday Pinkie proofing my house. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/981e5c928379726e8a5465a0de313407b31fb468?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dayimprover.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F07%2FHouse.jpg" /></p></div><p>Duct tape</p><p>Hope you all enjoyed it, and good luck this Halloween.</p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 39 - Time to play another game<br/>Edited by <a href="/user/Hollyhock" rel="nofollow">Hollyhock</a>, <a href="/user/andygrey" rel="nofollow">AndyGrey</a><br/>Pre-read by <a href="/user/Hollyhock" rel="nofollow">Hollyhock</a>, <a href="/user/andygrey" rel="nofollow">AndyGrey</a></p><p>AN: Please read the AN at the end, I'd like your opinion on something.</p><hr/><p>“Damn it’s cold!” I protested again as my body continued to shiver. I was seated cross-legged atop my bed and leaning against the wall with only a thin blanket covering me all but my face. The single blanket that I’d been using before Redheart brought me more had done little to ward off the cold. </p><p>“It’s not <i>that</i> cold,” Bronze commented.</p><p>“Fu-fur,” I replied between chattering teeth, pointing out the obvious while eyeing his coat with envy. “How’d it get s-so cold, so fast?” Two days ago I was still comfortably reading without the temperature bothering me one bit. </p><p>“Well we’re behind on fall season after all.” Bronze pointed outside the window with a wing. “Everypony’s busy trying to get the season moving.”</p><p>I looked out to the sky above Ponyville to see a great number of pegasi darting here and there. At times I caught sight of a rainbow trail flying in between them. The town’s always been bustling with activity on reconstruction and repair, but ever since the day before things had noticeably escalated. From dawn till dusk the sky had been filled with pegasi, flying in what I thought was chaos at first. But after some time I began to discern some patterns; enough to tell that they were all working together on something big. </p><p>It hadn't occurred to me that <i>something</i> was the actual season.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I guess when they say, ‘control the weather’, they really mean it.’</span></p><p>To be honest, I never completely believed Twilight or anyone else when they told me, but after watching it as it happened in person it was difficult to argue against it. Would such ridiculous notions become a norm in my life as time went by? Probably. After all, I’d gotten used to weaving and casting spells on a daily basis.  </p><p>“Wha-what do you mean by <i>behind’</i>?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, even with the dragon attack, Ponyville still has to keep its weather on schedule with the rest of Equestria,” he explained. “Usually the seasonal efforts would have started two days ago, but with the dragon attack screwing things up, well, it looks like Ponyville’s going to be behind on fall this year. Usually it’s winter clean up we have trouble with.”</p><p>“And what happens when you don’t meet the schedule?”</p><p>“Worst case? Well, when I was a foal I remember Hoofington being late on summer by a week, which resulted in rogue tornadoes tearing through the city and neighboring areas. The imbalance or mixing of seasons can create unpredictable and often dangerous weather like that. They cause more weather anomalies which can spread faster than most ponies can fly”</p><p>“Seriously?” I turned and looked out the window with worry. </p><p>“Don’t worry, that hasn’t happened in a long time. Part of Equestria’s Royal Guard is dedicated and specially trained to prevent this. They make sure all the weather is in order and on schedule and if it’s not they step in.”</p><p>“The Wonderbolts?” I asked, referring to a group of pegasi similar to the Blue Angels. </p><p>“Not them alone no, but you can consider them the ‘face’ of the squad. Didn’t think you’d know them.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Hard not to, seeing as Rainbow always brings them up on every occasion.’</span> It’s true, whenever Rainbow and I were together, even for a short while, the Wonderbolts would always become a topic or two. I know that one should chase one’s dreams, but in her case it was almost religious. </p><p>“Yeah,” Bronze continued, “the Wonderbolts. Think of them as the last line of defense in keeping all of Equestria’s weather in harmony. It’s really just a matter of embarrassment when a town or city fails to keep their seasons up to schedule.”</p><p>“Oh, well if that’s all,” I spoke, more relaxed. While I continued to watch the ‘seasonal change’ effort outside in silent interest, Bronze decided to pass the time by mending his beloved shield. He started polishing it with a rag  and mumbling to himself on how to go about removing the green scales that had embedded themselves when he bashed the dragon with it. </p><p>“Alright, here you go,” a voice said once the door opened.  I turned to see Redheart entering the room with several stacks of blankets neatly folded on her back. “These should be-ah!” Without warning, they burst into flames as I levitated each blanket from her back, causing Redheart to yelp in surprise. “You could have just waited,” she complained, irritated.</p><p>I simply shook my head in reply before quickly wrapping the blankets snugly around me, one on top of the other. Within seconds I could feel the layers of wool do their work, containing my body heat and warding off the cold. </p><p>“I suppose not having fur really puts you at a disadvantage,” Redheart commented. </p><p>“Wait till the summer heat and try saying that again,” I replied with a smile. “But you’re right, if this is just the fall temperature I should really get ready for winter. Otherwise I might not survive it.”</p><p>“It doesn’t snow where you come from?” Bronze asked. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered, keeping my answer short and simple so as to not accidentally slip anything that might point to my origin. “Even during winter, it hardly ever drops down to this.” Thankfully, I’d lived most of my life in warmer climates. </p><p>“Well look at the bright side, at least none of those news-ponies are around anymore.” </p><p>Bronze was right, most of them had left after Quillstride stole the thunder with her article three days ago. Only the persistent ones remained, but that didn’t last long either. I guess they must’ve known about the approaching cold and decided that a follow up story wasn’t worth it.  </p><p>To be honest I had doubts about how the article would turn out. I expected Quillstride to twist some parts of the interview in my expense to further popularize the article. But like everybody else, I was caught surprised at how nicely and fairly her article was formulated. If her future work on me was going to be even remotely similar to that, I had no qualms for another interview. </p><p>Following the article’s publication was a stream of visits from nearly everyone I knew. That frustrated Redheart more than a bit, she kept trying to turn them all away. But with so many ponies clamoring to see me she eventually relented, allowing each a short visit in an orderly fashion. </p><p>Applejack came by with sack of freshly picked apples, which Redheart immediately took into custody once she saw how furiously I ate them. Applejack apologized for not visiting more often, and I understood completely. I can only imagine how busy Applejack was taking care of the farm and all the temporarily homeless townsfolk. I doubted her family or her had a proper time for themselves since the attack. </p><p>As expected, Rarity came in all giddy with excitement during her visit. My impromptu advertising on the boutique really put her in a good mood; she kept babbling about new design lines and a bunch of other stuff about the fashion market I didn’t quite understand. She left, mentioning a special something for me as thanks, likely another pair of clothes. I just hoped it would be something warm. </p><p>Rainbow and Fluttershy came to visit together. This was the first time I had seen Fluttershy since the attack. From what Rainbow had told me, she had shut herself at home for several days before she could persuade her to come out. Apparently Fluttershy has an extreme phobia to dragons, the whole incident really did a number on her. She was still tense and kept glancing out at the sky during the visit, probably expecting to see another dragon. I couldn’t say I knew what to do to help her calm down, I don’t really have much experience in terms of counseling. In the end I decided it was probably best to let the other girls tend to Fluttershy seeing as they were closer and I was  still more of an acquaintance.  </p><p>I always felt there was something off about Pinkie, apart from her permanent state of sugar craze. She brought this….<i>thing</i> for me when she came. She claimed it was her super-special cupcake, I think. By now I had learned to filter out most of her random blabbering. Point was; she wanted me to eat the damn thing, a thing that was clearly ninety-nine percent sugar. Had Bronze not sensed the danger and slipped away to call Redheart, my stay in the hospital would have been extended indefinitely. </p><p>Strangely, neither Twilight, Spike, or Shine had come by. I had expected Twilight most of all to congratulate me on the article. As my ‘guardian’ this should have been something she’d pay attention to. </p><p>“Yes that’s certainly a relief,” Redheart agreed, “I don’t know how much longer we can keep the hospital on lockdown, which by the way…” She paused and looked at me suspiciously. “I’m still wondering how you managed to have that interview during lockdown.” I shrugged at her with a look of innocence that only made her roll her eyes before leaving. </p><p>With that, things fell silent once again. Bronze finished doing what he could for his shield before stretching out his hooves and closing his eyes for a nap. I simply melted into the warm embrace of the numerous layers of thick woolen blankets that covered me. Until a few minutes later when a knock on the door broke the tranquil peace. </p><p>“Excuse me,” spoke a deep and unfamiliar voice from the doorway. I turned to face the source of the voice and saw a large muscled pegasus standing in the doorway that was heavily bandaged in several parts of his body. What stood out the most on him was the pair of bat-like wings and overall dark appearance, something I recognized as the trademark traits belonging to the night guard. I’d never actually interacted with them before; Only seen them from a distance during my stay in Castle Canterlot. </p><p>“You must be the human,” he spoke, his eyes trailing over me. </p><p>“Not unless you’ve seen another,” I jokingly replied. “Can I help you with something?”</p><p>The pegasus shot a hoof up to his head in a salute. “Lieutenant Steadfast,” he introduced himself, “I was in charge of the unit sent to guard the town. I wish to offer my gratitude before leaving. My squad and I are due for Canterlot today.”</p><p>Memories of the battle between royal guards and Falnor flashed in my mind. “You led the charge against the dragon. Created that shield over the town.”</p><p>“I did. Though I led the attack while my second in command took charge of the town’s defense. She deserves some credit as well.” He trotted towards the bed and extended a hoof towards me. “I just came to thank you for what you did.”</p><p>Hearing this, I straightened my back and shook his hoof with respect. After taking a second look at his bandages I noticed the fur around them was blackened. I quickly realized he  must have been one of the many pegasi that got hit by Falnor’s homing fireballs. </p><p>“How is everyone doing?” I asked. “I had several of those things explode near me, I can sorta guess how bad it must’ve been to actually get hit.”</p><p>“Luckily nopony lost their lives.” His expression turned sad as he glanced away. “A few were forced to retire, unfortunately. Their injuries left them unable to carry out their duty any longer.” Seeing my worried expression he quickly added, “Don’t worry, nopony lost a wing or anything that extreme. They can no longer perform up to the standard their position demands.” His eyes wandered to my midsection. “Heard you got beaten up yourself.”</p><p>“Yeah, I did. Honestly I don’t know what I was thinking.”</p><p>“Those in service knew the dangers and risk when we signed up, but you’re just a civilian. A special guest of the thrones even.” Steadfast sucked in a deep breath. “To think we’d fail and force somepony else to do our job. That’s not going to look good on my record.” He paused. “Still, it’s amazing we didn’t receive any casualties. So I shouldn’t complain.” His eyes looked into mine. “Thank you for protecting everypony where we couldn’t, but please don’t do it again.”</p><p>I was caught off guard by that last part, but after hearing his words and having some idea of how he saw things; I thought I understood why. “No promises,” I replied honestly. </p><p>Steadfast looked at me in the eye for a few seconds before giving a nod. “I suppose not. I guess it just means us Royal Guards need to do our jobs better.” </p><p>“That would work; wouldn’t have to risk my life if you did,” I jokingly replied. “And it’s Rodney, no need for sir.”</p><p>“But you are the Princesses guest. But if you insist.” He smiled. “They said you had a carefree personality.”</p><p>“They?”</p><p>“The staff in the castle. You’ve got a bit of reputation amongst them. Even impressed a few guards with that stunt you pulled on Prince Blueblood.”</p><p>I chuckled at the memory. “He had it coming.”</p><p>“That he did.” He gave me another salute. “Best of luck Rodney.”</p><p>“And to you Steadfast,” I mimicked his salute with my own. Strangely enough, he turned and offered another salute to Bronze who was still in the middle of his nap. Bronze did mention that he was once in part of the guards, so it’s possible Steadfast knew him. “You know Bronze?” </p><p>“I wouldn’t be the pony I am today if it weren’t for him,” he answered vaguely before exiting the room. After Steadfast left I turned and stared at Bronze’s sleeping form. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Who was this guy?’</span> </p><p>As if to answer, Bronze let one rip in his sleep. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Hours later, around mid day]=========</p></div><p>The sound of several knocks came from the door. “Monsieur Rodney?”</p><p>Now, I’d spent a great deal of time in this world, and had come to notice the impossible similarity this world had with my own, often to the point of ridicule. It was something that I’d given up trying to understand and simply take as a blessing, but in some rare occasions this world seemed to screw with me more than it should. </p><p>There, standing right by the doorway, was a gryphon. </p><p>I’d read and seen pictures of them before in books. They were a thriving race much like the ponies and abundant in numbers. I figured it would only be a matter of time till I actually met one and had prepared myself so as not to get caught off guard. Specially with the publicity I’d gotten from the recent newspaper article.</p><p>But this one, was <i>nothing</i> like what I expected. </p><p>He had a mustache for one thing. One, impossibly long, mustache with a curl at the end which reminded me of generic villains from old sunday morning cartoons. As if that wasn’t enough, he also wore one of those tall chef hats along with a red cloth tied around his thick neck. </p><p>“Monsieur Rodney?” he repeated. Oh yeah, and he spoke with a French accent as well. </p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah, that’s me?” I replied with some apprehension. </p><p>His eagle eyes darted up and down as he scrutinized me. “I, am Gustave le Grand, baker extraordinaire.” He made a grand sweep with his left….claw, while the other twirled his mustache extravagantly. </p><p>If Bronze had been here and not taken another one of his strolls, which I suspect meant slipping a drink, he would have probably laughed his ass of at the spectacle. </p><p>“I have the greatest of honors, to be given a task by Princess Luna herself,” he continued. </p><p>A certain something between my legs shrunk and took cover inside my body. </p><p>“And uh,” I gulped nervously, “what exactly is that task?”</p><p>“I believe zis will better explain things.” From under his wing he took out a scroll and offered it to me.</p><p>Immediately I recognized the mark of the moon on the wax seal belonging to Luna. In most cases I would be worried, but with the events still fresh I doubted it could be anything too bad. I took the scroll, broke the seal and started to read. </p><blockquote><p><i>It is regretful that I am not able to visit you during your time of healing, but relieved to hear that you would make a full recovery. </i></p><p><i>No doubt you are wondering why I have sent you this gryphon. It is simple, a deed such as yours demand a reward. Consider your punishment over. </i></p><p><i>Enjoy.</i></p><p><i>Luna</i></p></blockquote><p>There was really only one thing that came to mind when Luna is involved. Well two things but I doubt my private parts has anything to do with it at the moment. Immediately, I turned my attention back to the gryphon. </p><p>It didn’t take much time for me to read the scroll, there wasn't much in it. But by that time Gustave had brought a cart covered in ornate white cloth into the room. Atop of lay a metal dome, similarly ornate with engravings all around the side. Before I could say anything the gryphon took the tip of the dome in between his claws and lifted. </p><p>Steam bellowed out and almost immediately the entire room was filled with the all too familiar smell of roasted meat. I wasn’t even aware that I was drooling when I looked down at a very hefty slab of meat, cooked to a perfect shade of brown with some sauce glistening over it. There were also some steamed vegetables to the side, but I hardly noticed them. </p><p>Strangely the first thing I said was, “I thought you were a baker.”</p><p>“I certainly am. But any chef worth zeir beak should know how to cook a decent meal fit for a fellow carnivore, no?” With practiced claws he lifted the tray carrying the food without disturbing it in the slightest and laid it on my lap. </p><p>If the scent was tantalizing before, now it was punching my brain right through my nose. I could feel the heat rising from the meat; I could almost see my own reflection in the fancy plate. I was all too ready to start gorging, but as my track record goes, I had to be careful. </p><p>“What is it?” I asked, trying my best to hold myself back. </p><p>“Shoulder cut of a manticore, slowly braised to perfection,” he answered with pride. “Ze sauce is a mixture of herbs and spices, but is primarily fish bones boiled and thickened to balance ze flavour of the meat.”</p><p><i>‘Manticore with fish sauce.’</i> I’m not too worried about the sauce, but the meat...</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Aren’t manticores poisonous?’</span></p><p><i>‘Only the tail….I think.’</i> There was an entry to manticores in one of the books, unfortunately it was focused more on the environmental view. There was nothing in regards to preparing it for consumption or whether it can even be done. The gryphon certainly didn’t appear troubled as he waited for me to start eating, but then again, we weren’t  the same species. Even if they could digest it safely I might not be able to. Still…..</p><p>It’d been soooooo long and now it was right there in front of me. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We’re in a hospital, should anything happen we’re already in the best place for it.’</span> That was all I needed, just one excuse to throw caution to the wind. </p><p>With near primal fervor, I grabbed the meath with both hands, causing the chains to rattle loudly as I bit off a large chunk. The moment my teeth sank in, thick juices exploded out, filling my mouth and dribbled down my chin. </p><p>And god almighty the flavour! </p><p>I’m not even sure if I can describe it properly. Texture wise it was similar to beef yet stringy and soft. I could actually feel each strip of muscle split and pop as I chewed. As for the flavour, the meat itself was surprisingly sweet, almost like candy. It would have probably been too sweet for my taste, were it not for the sour and tangy fish sauce. </p><p>“Aaaaaaahuuuhuuuhuhuuaaaahh….” I must have quite the expression on me since Gustave suddenly took a step back with a perplexed expression. </p><p>“I take it you enjoy it?” I looked at him with the most serene smile and a look of absolute bliss. Like a part of me once lost had returned and been made whole again. “If you enjoy zat, wait till I cook ze others.”</p><p>I froze mid bite. “Okhers?” </p><p>“Ze letter not explain?” I shook my head. “All ze payments and preparation are in order under Princess Luna’s request.” Gustave grabbed one side of the cloth, covering the cart he had wheeled in, and lifted it to reveal an assortment of objects. The space inside the cart was deceptively roomy, it was separated into three levels, each packed to the brim with utensils and cutlery tools. </p><p>What grabbed my attention the most was the middle level where ingredients lay stacked upon each other ready for use. Vegetables, fruits, berries and, most impressively, a large number of meat in various cuts and shape; likely from multiple kinds of animals. The amount of food there could easily feed a family for a whole day. </p><p>“Ze grand expertise of Gustave le Grand,” he continued with a slight bow, “is yours for ze day.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Lock the doors.’</span> </p><p>I complied. Blue fire crawled up to cover the door behind Gustave which began to close with a light creaking noise. The lock turned with an audible ‘click’, sealing the room from any and all disruption. </p><p>“Start cooking.”</p><hr/><p>“Twilight,” greeted the gray unicorn. </p><p>“Professor Inquest,” Twilight replied respectfully. “Wasn’t there supposed to be somepony else?” she asked, noting the absence of a second guest. </p><p>“She’ll be arriving later today,” he explained. “Ponyville is close enough from Canterlot for her to fly. Crea isn’t fond of teleporting.”</p><p>Twilight’s ears twitched recognizing the name. “Crea? As in Crea Whistwind?” Twilight is quite informed of Inquest’s many exploits throughout his life. Often purposefully researching them in order to find some way to obtain that elusive perfect mark from him. His most impressive feats have always included an equally famed gryphon. Twilight has never spoken to Crea, back then she was barely into adolescence and too timid to meet the gryphon. </p><p>“The very same.” Inquest took a step toward the purple mare as he regarded his surroundings. </p><p>There was a variety of machines lined up against the wall, some stacked in front of each other. It was easy to tell they were moved very recently. Having lived most of his life surrounded by all kinds of gadgets and machinations, Inquest could easily identify each of them with a glance. Or at least, what each machine was designed for. Of course he knew this was the basement of the library; they had agreed for him to teleport right to the center of the room. But what caught his attention were the two sets of beds at the other side of the wall. </p><p>“I’m afraid we don’t have room to properly house you in,” Twilight explained, noticing what he was looking at. “This was the best we could do in such a short amount of time.” Twilight mentally braced herself, expecting him to argue, yet he merely turned his head around eyeing every inch of the room. </p><p>“It’s alright,” he eventually replied. “In fact this will do quite nicely.” Before Twilight could even raise a brow in confusion, Inquest’s horn glowed a ghostly white as various contraptions and furniture began to hover. </p><p>Twilight watched as Inquest started redecorating the basement, the machines that she carefully moved away were being placed in a circular pattern, so that they surrounded the two. In most cases, Twilight would have felt rather peeved and somewhat insulted that somepony was moving stuff around as if it was their own home. However, at the moment, Twilight couldn’t help but be reminded of her old instructor’s expertise. Most would only see a unicorn casting a rather impressive levitation spell, but for a pony who had studied and practiced magic most of her life, the difference was clear as day. </p><p>As far as Twilight could tell, none of the objects Inquest was levitating ever tilted or wobbled as they moved about. This small and inconsequential detail was what truly showed the difference of magic and spell control that Twilight lacked. As the element of magic, Twilight easily had more magic in her arsenal than Inquest. But he had the advantage of aged skill, the decades of constant training and practice had given Inquest a level of mastery over magic that few could challenge. </p><p>To a point where such a basic and simple spell could leave Twilight staring and speechless. </p><p>“How are things?” Inquest asked, as he continue to rearrange the basement. </p><p>“Busy,” answered Twilight. </p><p>Inquest chuckled. “When are we not busy, Twilight?” The two fell silent for a while when they heard the door atop the stairs open.</p><p>“Twilight,” Spike called as his small dragon head poked in. “There’s a-oh, hey Professor. You’re here.”</p><p>“Spike.” Inquest greeted back. </p><p>Spike cleared his throat before continuing. “There’s a gryphon outside the library.”</p><p>“That must be Crea,” Inquest said. “I forgot how fast she can travel.”</p><p>“Let her in Spike,” Twilight instructed. </p><p>“Ok,” he replied before mumbling, “but I don’t think the door’s big enough.”</p><p>“Uhm, Professor,” Twilight started once they were alone once again. </p><p>Inquest placed the last furniture down before regarding the mare. “Yes, Twilight?” </p><p>“Exactly what are you doing in Ponyville? I can’t think of anything that would interest you here.”</p><p>“Recent events says otherwise. Besides, there are in fact several things in this quaint little town that do interest me greatly. Your friends for example.” Twilight raised her ears in interest.</p><p>“My friends? Why?” </p><p>“Oh, nothing much. I just heard that you and your friends happen to be the legendary Elements of Harmony,” he replied rather sarcastically which he would rarely do. “The Elements are the most powerful and ancient magic in all of the world.” Inquest stopped and pondered for a second. “One of them at least. I’d simply like a chance to analyze them.”</p><p>Twilight’s expression turned to worry. “Analyze them?”</p><p>Inquest laughed lightly. “Not what you think. I’d simply like to meet them is all. Could you perhaps introduce me to your friends?”</p><p>Twilight pondered the wisdom of that. “No tests?”</p><p>“Of course not, who do you think I am.” After a second he smiled. “I’ll ask their permission first.” </p><p>Twilight rolled her eyes before turning for the stairs. “I’ll see if they’re free to visit.”</p><p>Twilight was halfway up the stairs when Inquest spoke again. “It’s good to see you again. The castle feels quieter without you and Spike causing trouble.”</p><p>“I don’t cause trouble!” she replied defensively. </p><p>“No, I suppose not.” Inquest chuckled, remembering old memories. “But you were very different when you first arrived. Always curious and poking into my work, hoping to learn or gleam something that might impressed Celestia. You might not remember it, but a few of my experiments got botched because of you and Spike’s meddling. I still haven’t figured out how you two kept sneaking into my research wing.”</p><p>Twilight shot an irritated look at the old pony. “It’s not <i>your</i> research wing. It was built and funded by Equestria, you're just borrowing it.” She trotted up the stairs and opened the door with a spell only to turn around with a smile. “Spike and I would wait outside the door for your lunch. The staff always uses a cart so we hid under its covering and let them bring us in.” With a smug look Twilight left and closed the door behind her, leaving Inquest laughing out loud in disbelief. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Ponyville Hospital, near dusk]=========</p></div><p>“Oh yeeeeess!!”</p><p>Shine’s already pinkish cheeks reddened even further as she looked down the hallway, praying to Celestia that nopony was within earshot of that. Whether it was luck or the fact that everypony already heard and were now keeping their distance, Shine couldn’t tell but she has yet to see anypony pass by. Most of the staff were busy helping downstairs. From the looks of it, they were preparing to move quite a lot of patients for travel.</p><p>She was worried at first, finding the door locked and hearing somepony else inside. At least she knew nopony was being hurt, or at least that the human wasn’t. Rather the opposite it seems. The constant stream of moans and shouts sounds as if he was….</p><p>“Oh it’s so GOOOD!!” </p><p>Shine looked away from the door embarrassed, pondering once again whether she should stay or return another time. Originally, she had planned on visiting much earlier, but rearranging Twilight’s basement had taken much more time than she had expected. </p><p>A lot more. </p><p>She froze when the door suddenly gave a loud click. Shine turned to see the door swing open. She saw the cart at first, covered in what must have once been a rather expensive piece of cloth. Now it was marred with fresh stains in a variety of color. It would be ruined without the aid of magic. Atop the cart lay pots and pans stacked on top of each other next to a portable cooker. Though this one looked different from the ones Shine was accustomed to, likely a gryphon design that used flammable gas. Flammable gas systems were rather unpopular in Equestria and are often considered inferior to using ignition spells with gems to power them. Cooking next to a container that stored pressurized combustible gas just seem like a bad idea just waiting to explode.</p><p>The creature that was pushing the cart, however, surprised her. A gryphon was by no means a rare sight, especially to Shine, who had spent a majority of her life serving in the castle. She even served the ambassador on one occasion last year. Still, this particular gryphon had a rather unique appearance that caught her off guard.  </p><p><i>‘That mustache must’ve taken years to groom,’</i> was her first thought. As he moved nearer, Shine noticed how exhausted he appeared. His chef’s hat was slanted to the side and his wing hang low enough to drag against the floor. It took him a few seconds to realize he had company. </p><p>“Ah, pardon La Grand. I did not see you there.” He wiped his brow and beak of sweat before turning the cart and pushing past Shine. </p><p>“Sorry, but what were you doing in there?” she asked. </p><p>He paused and let out a sigh. “Cooking, I think.” Shine’s head tilted in confusion before the gryphon continued. “Nothing gives a chef more pleasure zan to see his dishes loved. Though in this particular case, perhaps zere is such a thing as too much love.” He removed his hat and dropped it atop his cart. “One of his more colorful praise was, and I quote: like an orgy in my mouth.” With that, he gave a slight bow to Shine and went on his way. </p><p>She stayed rooted in place, still not quite understanding what transpired in there. Not until the gryphon had turned and disappeared around the corner did Shine finally decided to find out herself what had transpired inside. Hesitantly she moved to the door and pushed it open. She didn’t know what to expect; luckily, nothing frightening or dangerous seem to stand out to her. Yet she stood there by the doorway with a perplexed look still not quite understanding what happened. </p><p>“Rodney?” she called. “Are you ok?”</p><p>He lay there, sprawled over his bed which was an absolute mess. Blankets lay strewn about the floor, and the bedsheet was heavily stained with different colors. What hit her the hardest though, was the smell of the room. It was a heavy, tantalizing smells that reminded her of the kitchens in Castle Canterlot. </p><p>Rodney mumbled something incoherent and continued to lay there in a mess with a look of absolute bliss. Shine noticed a round bulging mass where his stomach should have been. Bandages were still wrapped around him, but most had split apart and lay loosely to the side. It had probably failed to contain his growing stomach, and then ripped. </p><p>“Rodney?” she called again, now moving closer to poke him with a hoof. </p><p>“.....Hey, Shine,” he finally answered. “I suppose you're wondering what all this is, eh?” Shine nodded. “Let’s just say an itch has been scratched, and leave it at that.”</p><p>Shine let out a relaxed sigh deciding that whatever had happened wasn’t anything to be concerned about. Twilight did warn that he could be rather perplexing at times. </p><p>“Let’s get you cleaned up.” It took the human several seconds to respond with nod. Whatever had happened behind the locked door seemed to have slowed his brain down a bit. Helping and acting as support for him to lean on, Shine eventually led Rodney to the bathroom and left him there to clean himself up. </p><p>“Now then,” she gazed about at the mess, “where to begin.”</p><hr/><p>“Damn,” I looked around the room eyes wide with surprise, “how long was I in there?”</p><p>“Oh about seven minutes I think,” she answered while pulling fresh new sheets over my bed. I gave the room a second look, but so far, every stain or trace of my little meat festival was gone. Everything was spotless; only the lingering smell and what I wore remained. </p><p>“You cleaned all that on your own?” I asked in disbelief. </p><p>“You forget I worked in the castle for years. That was nothing compared to the workload there. I’m very good at my job.” She gestured to her mark. “It is my special talent after all.”</p><p>She even had time to do Bronze’s bed, which strangely enough still remained empty. “Bronze isn't back yet?” I asked, pointing to his bed. </p><p>“I haven’t seen him,” Shine replied. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Probably still out drinking.’</span> </p><p>“You still need to get that changed,” Shine said, eyeing my attire. Looking down, I can’t help but agree with her. I was still wearing the makeshift hospital gown, now stained, my belly bulging out as if I was four month pregnant. </p><p><i>‘Surprised I managed to eat all of that.’</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Our next dump will be epic.’</span> </p><p>“So,” I started while moving for the bed, “finally decided to drop by eh? Was starting to worry.”</p><p>“Sorry, things have been busy in the library.” She took a few steps back, making room for me to carefully drop back down on the bed. </p><p>“Is that why Twilight hasn’t been paying any visits?” I asked once I finally got into a comfortable position. “Where all my blankets?”</p><p>“I left them outside. Why? Are you cold?” </p><p>I considered asking her to retrieve them despite knowing how dirty they were. “Yeah but...hmm, guess I’ll just ask Redheart for more.” Bronze’s blanket floated off his bed and slowly drifted towards me. Which I quickly wrapped myself with. </p><p>“So, Twilight?”</p><p>“Oh right, well we needed to rearrange and clean up the basement for guests.” Shine let out a frustrated sigh. “I would have finished it much sooner but we kept doing it over and over just to make sure everything’s in order. From what Spike told me, that’s something of a norm for miss Twilight.”</p><p>“A rather zealous perfectionist isn’t she?” I commented with a smile. “So, who's the guest?”  </p><p>“The Professor,” she answered. </p><p>I waited, but it didn’t look like a name was going to follow. “Professor….who?”</p><p>“Professor Inquest.” I looked at her with a slight confused look. “Oh right, I suppose you wouldn’t know anything about him.” She looked down in thought, probably trying to figure out where to begin. </p><p>“Is he Twilight’s teacher or something?” I asked.</p><p>“He is. From what I know, he taught her back when she was living in the castle, along with several other teachers.” Shine moved towards the other side of the room and sat on one of the large pillows. “But I don’t think he does that anymore, I ever hardly met him in the castle. Mostly because he keeps himself to the research wing and his private quarters. He mostly just goes about his research and overseeing all the experiments.”</p><p>“So he lives in the castle? Far as I could remember I haven’t met or seen anyone like that when I was there.”</p><p>“Well of course, he’s The Professor after all. Although not demanded, all advisors to the throne are encourage to reside in the castle.” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So, like, the president’s science advisor?’</span> </p><p><i>‘Sounds like it. But what’s with the singular term?’</i> </p><p>“Why are you calling him ‘the’ professor? Is he the only one in Equestria?”</p><p>“Yes-uhm no. There are other professor as well, but he’s <i>The</i> Professor.” Shine sucked in a breath before explaining. “The title Professor was originally an advisory position to the throne involving everything to do with magic and its uses. In the old days it was a title only a single pony can have. But now, anypony with enough qualifications, expertise, and knowledge in their chosen field can obtain the title of professor.”</p><p>“Let me guess, <i>The</i> Professor refers only to the original position?”</p><p>“Precisely. Currently, the one who holds that position is Professor Inquest. If I’m not mistaken he was the youngest to ever take it.”</p><p>It all made sense; there was likely to be other, similar advisory positions that helped keep the government together, much like back home. Economy, health, technology, sociology...or ponyology, these would all have to be advisory positions, so having one that specialize in magic is expected.  </p><p>“So what’s his job exactly?”</p><p>“I...don’t really know. Researching I guess. Though I heard he also goes on missions.”</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, both confused and surprised. “Missions? Like, diplomatic missions?”</p><p>“That, and dangerous ones too.” Shine thought for a moment. “Though I think it’s not obligated. I think Professor Inquest goes because he wants to. I don’t know the details but he’s got a really big reputation because of it.”</p><p>“You seem to know an impressive amount, though,” I said. </p><p>“That’s only because I worked at the castle; you tend to pick up a few things here and there about Equestria that nopony else knows. Like, did you know that there’s an entire cave network under the mountain made of crystals? I think I heard one of the new recruits accidently….”</p><p><i>‘You thinking what I’m thinking?’</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You know how stupid that question is? But if you really want an answer; yes I am.’</span> </p><p><i>‘If what Shine says about this Inquest guy is true, he’s not the type to roll into town for no good reason. Either something has happened, or something is about to.’</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Let’s hope it’s the former and he’s just here because of the dragon attack.’</span> </p><p><i>‘And if he’s not?’</i> </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Then there’s no fair god in this world. We just survived a fucking dragon! We should at least be given time to heal before the shit hits the fan again.’</span> </p><p>“....but nopony believed him at first. So he made a bet with the whole barrack that nopony could-”</p><p>“Shine,” I called, interrupting her story, “do you know why he’s here? The Professor.”</p><p>“Can’t say I do,” she answered. </p><p>My shoulders dropped disappointedly. “When will he arrive?”</p><p>“Today. Probably already here.”</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath, pinched the bridge of my nose, and made a silent prayer to any higher power that might be listening. “Please. Not again.”</p><hr/><p>They are not returning.</p><p>Yellow, slitted eyes darted about, scanning the sky. But try as she might, there were no signs of them or a different group returning. </p><p>There were too many of them at first. Too crowded and too risky. So it waited, and waited, until finally...</p><p>They left. </p><p>A large group of them, injured ones, left when the sun started to descend from the heavens. It didn’t know why, didn’t know if they would return. </p><p>And so it waited some more. Just enough to make sure that there wouldn’t be any surprises. </p><p>Now was the chance it had waited for so long. There were only few inside, enough to sneak around. Night was here, the shadows will hide her lithe and small body. </p><p>In complete silence, a cat of pure darkness strolled out into the open road and made it’s way slowly towards the large doorway. Shadowy wisps rose from the ground upon which it stepped, as if it was scorching the earth with every touch. </p><p>The cat didn’t paused when it reached the glass double doors. Never hesitated, not even, when its head was mere inches from colliding with the door. Like water, the cat’s form shifted right into the small opening between the two doors. It slid right through with ease, as if they didn’t exist, and returned back to form on the other side. It smiled happily, imagining the fun it would have on this one. Enthralling the old dragon was purely out of the dire situation of finding itself in a strange new land. But now, it’s time for the real fun to begin.</p><p>“Time to play,” it sang in a childlike voice, “another game.”</p>

							<header><h1>Author's Notes:</h1></header>
<p>Yes, I know it's been a long time. Technically since I'm on holiday I should have more time to write right? Well turns out never really pans out as you'd expect. I won't bore you with details of my life but in short: something really good happened, then bad, and finally to worse. Each one took a lot of time to sort out. </p><p>Now then. I took the liberty of explaining who Inquest is in this chapter rather than adding bits here and there throughout the story. Also, the plot has finally moved on. I was tempted to wait for Rodney to heal up some more, but at the same time no enemy would actually wait you to do that. </p><p>On a different note. Andy, one of my editor, brought to my attention that Rodney might be too &quot;perfect&quot;. A Mary Sue problem he calls it. Thinking it over, I can see his point. So I would love to know all of your opinion on this. It would really help make Rodney more real and believable as a character. Below I've posted a comment that you can up-vote or down-vote depending on your opinion. And please by all mean offer your own criticism by replying if you wish. </p><p>*breath in, breath out*</p><p>I know that the Halloween Special was really popular (yay!) and a lot of you wanted that as part of the main story line, mainly because you all want the backlash Rodney would get. And I tried, I really did. But I just can't make it work up to a quality and cohesion that I wanted. So regretfully that chapter is still completely separated from the rest. </p><p>I would also like to apologize to those that contacted me in regards to a pre-reader position on this fic. I sorta disappeared and never replied after my flight home, and by that time I sorta completely forgot among all I had to deal with.</p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 40 - Jo<br/>Edited (Eventually) by AndyGrey, Hollyhock<br/>Pre-read (Eventually) by AndyGrey, Hollyhock</p><hr/><p>“These are the Elements of Harmony?” Crea’s eyes fell on each mare as she studied them. They were grouped together on one side of the room while Crea and Inquest were on the opposite. The main floor of the tree structure, a library, was the only room large enough for them all to mingle comfortably. </p><p>As an accomplished hunter, it was crucial for Crea to have the necessary knowledge and wit to spot the tiniest detail that might clue her to hidden dangers. Such skill has, on countless occasions, saved her from poisonous creatures, skulking predators, and even from “civilized” individuals. </p><p>But nothing about these mares stand out as dangerous to her in any sense of the word. The way they trotted and carried themselves showed no signs of a seasoned pony. A few of them were physically above average, especially the earth pony with the hat; but even then, Crea felt confident she could overpower them. The most potentially dangerous one would be the purple unicorn, but that’s merely because she <i>was</i> a unicorn; magic is always unpredictable. However her being both Celestia’s and Inquest’s student was also a rather intimidating notion.</p><p>“They’re nothing but kids,” Crea whispered.  </p><p>“And yet, records say otherwise,” Inquest replied. “Ladies.” Inquest greeted the mares with a practiced bow. “It’s wonderful to finally meet-”</p><p>“Hi! I’m Pinkie Pie!” Inquest’s head jerked back as the pink mare seemingly teleported right in front of him. </p><p>“A plea-,” Inquest tried to respond before he was interrupted again. </p><p>“I’ve never seen a pony with such a long horn before well maybe with Princess Celestia and Luna but you’re not an alicorn since you have no wings and that’s a very weird cutie mark is your special talent putting locks on books because that would be-”</p><p>Try as she might, Twilight couldn’t hide her smile at the sight of her toughest mentor interacting with Pinkie Pie for the first time. Were it any other pony, Twilight would have come to their aid already, but in this case, she opted to hang back and enjoy the scene. </p><p>“...and oh my gosh you must be the biggest gryphon ever!” Like a foal finding a new toy, Pinkie Pie quickly changed her attention to the large gryphon. “And why do you have straps and a belt with so pockets?” Crea’s head turned here and there as she tried, and failed, to keep track of the pink mare who kept disappearing and reappearing all around her; a couple of times appearing from right under her wing, or out of her bag of numerous supplies. </p><p>“Do forgive her,” spoke an elegant voice, “Pinkie Pie can be a hoof-full but she means well.” Rarity stepped forward from the group. “Rarity, a wonderful pleasure,” she greeted, offering her hoof. </p><p>Inquest let out a sigh, relieved to finally have a conversation with a normal pony. “And you must be Rarity Belle.” Inquest gently shook her hoof in a manner of the upper class. “Believe me the pleasure is all mine. I’ve heard so much about you; your generosity is a gift to Equestria.”</p><p>Rarity couldn’t help but giggle like a young filly, it was rare for her to be treated like the lady she was by a true gentlecolt. “And I you!” she replied enthusiastically. “The youngest pony to attain an advisory position to the throne. As the famed ‘Professor’ no less.”</p><p>“Never heard of you,” Rainbow said nonchalantly which earned Rarity’s disapproving look. “What? I haven’t,” Rainbow continued innocently. </p><p>“Hooowee!” Applejack suddenly trotted past the two and took Inquest’s hoof in a rough shake. “The name’s Applejack, and it’s an honor teh meet yeh Professor!”</p><p>“A-as I to you,” Inquest greeted back, surprised by her forceful hoof-shaking. </p><p>“Wait, you know The Professor?” Rarity asked slightly surprised. </p><p>“Do I? Sweet Apple Acres owe plenty of favours to this ‘ere pony.” Applejack turned her attention back to the stallion. “Ah can’t thank you enough for them earths you made.”</p><p>“If-if you mean the earths with concentrated levels of magic,” Inquest replied as Applejack continue to shake his hoof, “it was nothing.”</p><p>“Nothing? Your fertilizer done our farm wonders! Our trees grow faster, stronger, and bear the sweetest apples ever. Why ah wouldn’t be surprised if every farmer here and yonder was using the stuff. Ah don’t suppose there’s any chance for something new you might have in the works?” </p><p>As Applejack continued to converse with Inquest, Rarity informing Rainbow who Inquest was, and Pinkie Pie bouncing about Crea; that left Fluttershy alone and unsure what to do. Truth be told, she too was rather ignorant of The Professor, only aware that he was an advisor to the throne and nothing else. She simply lacked any interest in the subject to learn more. In fact, what really took her attention at the moment was the gryphon. </p><p>Like meeting a new animal Fluttershy couldn’t help but want to learn all about them, that’s not to say that she’s never encountered one before. Her last meeting with their kind was unfortunately far from what anypony would call pleasent. Gilda, Rainbow Dash’s old time friend, turned out to be a bully. That left a lingering impression and made it hard for her to approach Crea for fear she might be similar. The gryphon’s intimidating size didn’t help either. </p><p>“Uhm, Spike,” Fluttershy called softly to the dragon standing next to her. “What do you know about her?” she asked, pointing one of her primary feathers at the gryphon. </p><p>“Oh that’s Crea uhm, something-wind,” Spike answered. “Twilight said I met her a long time ago, back when we lived in the castle. But I don’t remember.”</p><p>Crea, with her honed senses, easily overheard her name softly spoken from the other side of the room. Seeing the young dragonling, Crea started to make her way towards them only to have Pinkie appearing and blocking her way as she continue on jabbering nonsense. With a sigh Crea stuck a claw into one of her many pockets and pulled out a large deep green leaf. Originally used by the Buffaloes to repel insects, Crea discovered it had a rather interesting side effect on ponykind.</p><p>“What’s this?” Pinkie asked, eyeing the leaf in Crea’s claw curiously. </p><p>“Smell it,” Crea spoke brushing the leaf across the mare’s muzzle. </p><p>The effects was nearly instantaneous, the scent of the unique essential oil made Pinkie freeze in her tracks and the iris of her eyes suddenly grew several times bigger. As inquest described it, the sensation felt like having the inside of your nose tickled followed by a “happy” feeling. </p><p>In other words; catnip for ponies. </p><p>With an “Oooooohh,” Pinkie took the leaf with both forehooves and planted her rear on the floor. Giggling to herself, she pressed and scrunched up the leaf over her muzzle and breathed in its sweet minty scent; oblivious to the enormous shadow as Crea stepped over her. </p><p>“...and supposedly she went with-oh she’s coming this way,” Spike informed. </p><p>“Oh dear! Oh my!” Fluttershy wasn’t quite ready to meet her just yet, her timid nature was yelling for her to hide. Panicked and unable to find any suitable hiding spot close by, Fluttershy opted for whatever was available. With a squeak she jumped right behind the young dragon, hid behind her long mane, and tried her best to shrink as small as possible. </p><p>The sight of a full grown pegasus trying to hide behind a dragon at least half her size made Crea pause in her step. “She alright?” Crea asked, looking both confused and worried. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Spike replied. “It’s normal. I’m Spike.”</p><p>“I know.” Spike raised an eyebrow. “A dragon raised by a pony? You don’t forget something like that. Saw you a couple of times when I used to drop by Canterlot in between missions. Always following that purple unicorn around.” The memory of her first encounter with Spike made Crea broke out in a laugh. </p><p>“What’s so funny?” </p><p>“I just remembered the first time I saw you. Don’t think you’d remember, otherwise you would’ve probably ran at the sight of me.” </p><p>“Why?” Spike asked hesitantly. </p><p>“Because, I tried to kill you.”</p><p>“What!?” Spike yelled as he jumped back, pushing against Fluttershy who squeaked like a stuffed animal. </p><p>“Well I didn’t know there was a dragon living in the castle,” Crea started to explain. “I was walking down one hallway and you suddenly showed up from around the corner. Reflexes took over and I grabbed you by the neck.” Crea tilted her head towards one side of the room where Twilight was. “If she wasn’t there to stop me, well, you know...”</p><p>Try as he might Spike had no recollection of that encounter, though he did vaguely remember days where his throat was sore for weeks. “Why would you do that!?” Spike asked, both angered and confused. </p><p>“Oh I don’t know, maybe it’s because I’ve got feathers all over and you can breathe fire,” she responded with heavy sarcasm. “I was caught of guard and frightened,” she defended. “It was all reflex.”</p><p>Hearing this Fluttershy’s ears shot straight up at attention, poking out off her pink mane. “You’re afraid of dragons?” she asked just barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Who isn’t?” Crea replied in a ‘isn’t that obvious’ tone. “Oh where are my manners, I haven’t introduced myself.” Crea held her claw out. “Crea Whistwind.”</p><p>Discovering she shared something with the gryphon, Fluttershy slowly started to come out of her hiding. “Uhm, Fluttershy.” Hesitantly Fluttershy reached out with a hoof, expecting it to be crushed. Yet surprisingly Crea took her hoof with the gentlest touch and shook ever so lightly. </p><p>“So, you thought Spike was going to burn you? But, back then he must’ve been just a few months old. Dragons that young can’t breath fire yet.”</p><p>“Well I didn’t know that. The youngest dragons I’ve dealt with were in their adolescence, and most of them are jerks. You’re a pegasus so you should know how fast feathers burn.” Crea looked at Spike. “I apologized before but since you don’t remember; I’m sorry. Like I said, it was all reflex. Sometimes I wish I had scales instead. Never have to worry so much when cooking or sleeping next to an open fire.”</p><p>With the apology and praise, Spike’s alarmed expression quickly turned to a smug smile. “They are awesome,” he replied, rubbing his belly proudly.</p><p>“But what about Rodney?” Fluttershy spoke. “He doesn’t have any fur or feathers. Not even a thick hide.”</p><p>“Who?” Crea asked. </p><p>“He’s the human,” Spike answered. “You know, the one that’s been on the papers for a while now.”</p><p>“Ah, yeah,” Crea responded, remembering the conversation she had with Inquest about the human. “The other ‘visitor’,” she mumbled.  </p><p>“The what?” Spike asked.</p><p>“Nothing.” Crea looked around the room. “Where is he by the way? I heard he was living in this town.”</p><p>“Oh uhm,” Fluttershy started shyly. “I’m sorry but I don’t think you’ll be seeing him. He’s in the hospital right now.” Reminded of the injured human, Fluttershy’s expression turned to pity as she whimpered. “He tried to save everypony and got hurt. I really hope he’ll be fine.”</p><p>Crea scratched the underside of her beak in thought. “Excuse me.” Without any other explanation Crea turned and moved towards the old grey stallion. She stood in his field of vision and with a gestured flap of her wing, signalled for a private conversation. </p><p>“Ladies, pardon me for a moment.” With a slight bow he trotted past and met Crea some distance away. “What is it?”</p><p>“Remember that human you mentioned? The friendly ‘visitor’? Just thought you should know that he’s not here. Apparently he’s in hospital at the moment.”</p><p>Inquest’s ears twitched hearing that. “The human,” he mumbled in thought. </p><p>Though he would not admit, Inquest had completely forgotten about the human when formulating this plan. Only during preparation to teleport over did he finally remember. Luckily it didn’t force Inquest to restrategize in any major way, it only added another variable he needed to think about. </p><p>What was difficult however, is determining how big of a player this human was. His origin, nature and abilities are certainly something worth studying and thus protecting. But much of him remains a mystery. In other words, in the grand scheme of things, he was a wild card. </p><p>Of course it would be convenient if he were here with the rest of the Elements, making it easier to protect them all. But should things turn for the worst; the loss of a friendly visitor from another world, as regrettable as it will be, would be nothing more than a loss of opportunity. Compared to Twilight or any of the other Elements of Harmony whose sudden disappearance may jeopardize Equestria; it was plainly obvious which should be made a priority. It’s bad enough he was using them as bait without their knowledge or Celestia and Luna’s; they would never approve. </p><p>“We’ll stick to the plan,” he concluded. </p><p>“You sure?” Crea leaned in and whispered. “You don’t need me for this part. You can plant your tracking spells on the mares without me. I can go check on the human.” Again Inquest fell silent as he considered this alteration to the plan. </p><p><i>‘Was it worth the risk to split apart?’</i> he asked himself. There’s no telling when this creature will strike, they had planned to stay for the foreseeable future or until he was convinced there was no threat. A lot of factors about this plan was based on probable guesswork, and actual intel on this hostile ‘visitor’ was scarce. <i>‘If magic would not work, Crea would be paramount in capturing it.’</i> A mere month ago the idea of a creature completely immune to magic was ludicrous. Yet now there exists a known being that is not only immune, but drinks it dry for his own use. There has yet to be any evidence to suggest the hostile ‘visitor’ could do the same, but nothing to say it could <i>not</i> either.</p><p>Again, a gamble with wildcards. For Inquest who was an agent of logic and calculation, which has served him well throughout his life, this predicament was extremely frustrating to him. He could not calculate the probable outcomes as he often could throughout his missions, making him hesitate on crucial decisions. </p><p>“It’s up to you,” he spoke, trusting his partner’s instincts over his own. </p><p>Crea looked out the closest window for a moment as she considered what to do. “I’ll leave right now,” she decided. </p><p>Inquest nodded. “If I’m correct; you should find the hospital at the edge of town. Off to the west. It’ll be big,” he informed. “Then return immediately once you’ve confirmed the human’s safety. We must always be on the ready and in close proximity to the Elements. If we’re lucky, nothing happens tonight. I’ve already cast a tracker on one of the bearers, it’ll take some time to do the rest discretely.” </p><p>“What about the purple unicorn?” Crea’s eyes flickered to Twilight for the briefest moment. “Won’t she be able to tell? Being Celestia’s and your student.”</p><p>“It’ll be tough,” Inquest agreed, glancing at Twilight. “She is a sharp one alright.”</p><p>Crea looked at him with a raised brow. “Was that pride I hear? To think The Professor is proud of something other than his experiments,” she teased. </p><p>Inquest swung a hoof at her which she easily dodge. “Are you leaving or not?” he responded irritably. </p><p>With an amused smile Crea turned and quickly made her way towards the front door. “Sorry, just remembered something I had to do,” she spoke loudly. Before anypony could even say goodbye, she ducked and squeezed through the doorframe and flew off. </p><p>“Where is she off to in such a hurry?” Twilight asked. </p><p>“Crea can be rather forgetful at times. But it’s nothing to worry about.” Inquest lied. “Now then, where were we?”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Several hours before]=========</p></div><p>“Shouldn’t you be going back soon?” I gazed out the window at the night sky. “Pretty sure visiting hours are over.” For a long time now I’ve been expecting Redheart to come by and ask Shine to leave, but she never came. In fact nobody came. Bronze still hasn’t returned and I was starting to worry for him. I knew he had every intention to return; his beloved shield was still here leaning against the wall. </p><p>“You’re right,” Shine replied, pushing herself up to stand. “Would you like me to bring anything tomorrow?” </p><p>“Actually,” several selected books ignited into flames as it hovered towards Shine. “You can take these back to Twilight. Tell her I’m done and thank you.” I then realized that without a saddlebag or something similar, Shine had no means of carrying all the books; and I doubt she could balance it on her back all the way. “Or tomorow,” I added returning and dropping the books back on the pile. </p><p>“I’ll pick them up tomorrow,” she agreed. “You know,” she continued, her eyes gazing up and down at me. “You look better.”</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“Well, you’re more active and appear to be in less pain. And you’ve got more color too.”</p><p>“It’s got a horrible stink,” I patted the bandages coiled around midsection, “but they do work. Naturally the rib takes the longest to heal so bending over or twisting too far still hurts. But everything else is fine. Even the bruises are disappearing.” I got off the bed and walked around the room to prove it. “So long as I keep myself straight, I can pretty much move around like normal.”</p><p>“Don’t get any ideas,” Shine warned. “You still need your rest.”</p><p>I chuckled. “For a moment there you sound like both Twilight and Redheart.” I pretended to shiver in fright. “I should probably be terrified of that.”</p><p>“I’m starting to understand some of Miss Twilight’s description about you,” she replied after rolling her eyes. </p><p>“I’m certain they’re nothing but lies and slander,” I replied jokingly. </p><p>“Seems pretty accurate to me.” Shine scanned the room one last time before trotting towards the door. “If there’s nothing else...”</p><p>“Wait, hold up.” Tightening my hospital gown around me, I caught up to Shine by the doorway. “I’ll walk you out, it’s the least I could do after keeping me company for so long.”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that. Redheart would want you to stay in bed and rest.” Can’t say I was surprised to hear that. </p><p>“Look I’ve been hold up in this room for days on end, with nothing to do but read,” I complained. “Sure the books are entertaining enough but I need to get out and move or I’ll go stir crazy.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she mumbled. </p><p>“It’s just to the front door,” I continued. “Then I’ll head right back to my room ok?”</p><p>She thought for a moment. “Promise?”</p><p>“Oh for crying-yes I promise.” I raised a hand towards the hallway. “After you.”</p><p>With Shine a step ahead, I started walking barefooted down the hall towards the stairs that would eventually lead down to the main lobby. From the darkness ahead, it seems the hallway in front of my room was the only one currently lit. Assuming that Steadfast had already left with the rest of his squad, it probably meant Bronze and I were the only patients on this floor. It wasn’t entirely dark, luckily this part of the building had windows to the outside which allowed moonlight to pour in. Just enough to light the way, though it also gave a rather eerie vibe.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Remember those Japanese horrors?’</span> And with that single comment all the memorable hospital themed horror movies started flooding my mind. </p><p><i>‘Why would you bring that up?’</i> Unfortunately I’ve watched some of the really good ones, meaning they’ve successfully scared the shit out of me. I knew such things were mere fantasy, but I was a person with a very wild imagination. It has its uses, but on occasion I let it affect me more than is should. Where I was casually walking carefree five seconds ago, now I was on edge and glancing at every shadow for a long black haired women in white. Or some other creepy nonsense. </p><p>But that’s when realization hit me like a truck; I noticed that everything was way too quiet. Like silent dead quiet. The only sounds I could hear were the metallic jungling of my chains and Shine’s hooves on the hard floor surface. </p><p>“Hold up,” I spoke, placing a hand on Shine’s back to halt her. </p><p>“What?” she asked unaware, her voice echoed onwards.</p><p>I didn’t answer, rather I stayed still and strained my ears to catch the slightest bit of noise, anything that might indicate some other presence in the building besides ourselves. I turned and looked back down the hall where we came, then back forward but saw nobody. Even resorting to my ‘Sense’ in order to hopefully feel someone else on the floors above or below. </p><p>But again; nothing. The only ‘heat’ I felt was from Shine standing next to me. </p><p>“Where is everybody?” I asked softly, but that too sounded like a shout in the absolute silence.</p><p>“Well everybody left earlier today remember?” she reminded. “All the guards along with the nurses and doctors that came from Canterlot to help with the injured.”</p><p>“Yeah I know but...” I looked at Shine with worry. “Where’s the regular staff? All the other patients and nurses and doctors should still be here.”</p><p>Shine looked back and forward much like I did, her long ears swiveling like radars trying to catch any sound. “Hello!?” she suddenly shouted. We both waited, but the only response we got were Shine’s own voice echoing back several times. “They...might have gone home for the night,” Shine guessed. </p><p>I was unconvinced. “Everyone of them? All the patients released at the same time? Nobody even came by to check up on us or ask you to leave after visiting hours are over.”</p><p>“Maybe they forgot?”</p><p>“This is Redheart we’re talking about.” I didn’t know much of Redheart as a pony, but as a nurse it was easy to tell she was impeccable and meticulous at her job. No way she would have just up and left home without dropping by to check on me first. Like she does every night. </p><p>“Right.” Shine now had the same worried expression as I did. Her ears stood up straight and was now on alert. Not sure if she was aware, but I noticed her fur looked slightly more ‘puffed’ than before. Probably a reaction similar to goosebumps.</p><p>“C’mon,” I started walking, “let’s see if we can find anyone.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We should take caution, just in case.’</span> </p><p>Heading the voice in my head I looked at Shine. “Let’s keep quiet from now on, just in case.” </p><p>“I’m sure things are fine,” she replied, mostly to herself I think. </p><p>“If it’s nothing then it’s nothing. But if not...” I let that last part go unfinished, it was clear what it implied. She fell silent at that and her demeanor changed dramatically. </p><p>We continued on for several minutes towards the main staircase and unfortunately both of us had trouble keeping silent. Shine’s hoofsteps were like two-halves of coconuts shells hitting each other on the hard floor. Where as I found it impossible to keep my chains from rattling with every step. Luckily we reached the stairs without any incident, and like the rest of the building the lights in that area were off as well. I could still ‘sense’ the magic in the gems on the ceiling, so I knew they were still working. But that only meant that nobody was around to turn them on. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Or couldn’t.’</span></p><p><i>‘Did you have to say it all ominous like that?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Couldn’t resist.’</span></p><p>Going down the stairs was rather problematic for me, they were designed for ponies making it steeper and longer from what I was used to. With my fractured rib, I had to take each step slow and in an awkward manner to keep the pain to a minimum. Too slow for her liking, Shine decided to venture further ahead and disappeared around the corner before I even got halfway. </p><p>“Shine wait up,” I called in a whisper. No reply. “Shine?” I called again. No reply. </p><p>Fearing something had happened I quickened my pace took the pain head on with each step. Unlike the floor before, there were no windows in this hallway, only doors to patient rooms. Without any source of light nearly every bit of the ground floor was in perfect darkness.   </p><p>“Shine,” I called again, slightly louder.</p><p>“Here,” she finally replied closeby. “I’m trying to find the gem for the lights.”</p><p>“Light,” I whispered, thinking the gem would react to a voice command. </p><p>“It’s a old system,” Shine informed in a whisper. “There’s a specific gem you have to touch.”</p><p>I channeled a bit of magic on my hand. Whispy fire poured out from my skin and gathered into a small glowing ball of fire. It hovered in my palm, the size of a grape, and acted as a source of light to repel the dark. Dangerous I know, even if it’s small I was still holding on to a fireball that’ll explode should I lose control of it.</p><p>Beats fumbling about in the dark. </p><p>“Rodney!” Shine suddenly shouted in alarm startling me. Shine suddenly galloped away towards the edge of the light and hunched over a dark shape. As I quickly joined her and brought my ‘fire’ closer, I realized the dark shaped was in fact a pony; a mare with a familiar red cross for her mark. </p><p>“Redheart?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Shine answered, running her hooves and inspecting the head nurse’s body. From the way Shine methodically examined Redheart’s head, to neck, body and legs; it was clear she knew what she was doing.</p><p>“You trained?” I asked in a whisper, bringing my ‘fire’ closer so that Shine could get a better look. </p><p>“Just the basics. Every staff in the castle has to have some first aid training in case of emergencies.” Hearing this I left Shine to do her thing while I kept watch, constantly turning my head from side to side. “She’s still breathing but I can’t seem to wake her up. I don’t see any injuries either. Can you give me more light?”</p><p>At first I questioned the wisdom of making ourselves more noticeable with a large source of light, but then again I was already holding onto a blue fireball in the dark. No matter how small it would be impossible to miss it in the dark. Carefully, I allowed more magic to travel down my arm and escape through my palm where more thin bluish flames escaped and merged with the fireball. Slowly it grew and so did the intensity of the light, pushing the shadows further and further away. </p><p>“Shine,” I called in a low tone. </p><p>“What?” Shine asked still focused and looking down on Redheart. </p><p>“We need to move.”</p><p>“I’m not done-” I placed a hand atop of Shine’s head and forced her to look further down the hallway. Her hooves jumped to her muzzle with a frightful gasp. </p><p>There was another body on the floor only a meters away. </p><p>There’s no denying it now, there was something dangerous here and probably still in the building. Rather than play hide and seek in the dark, I decided that it was better to see the danger coming. I raised the fireball up and fed a substantial amount of magic causing it to double in size. With a baseball sized fireball in hand the light pierced the dark all the way to both ends of the hallway.</p><p>“Ooh,” was all Shine could speak at the sight. In both directions the hallway was littered with the bodies of ponies, both patients and staff. </p><p>“Are they all knocked out?” I asked. Shine didn’t answer, still gawking in shock. “Shine,” I called slapping the back of her head slightly but enough to snap her out of it. </p><p>“Oh, uhm yes, I-I think so.” She took a tentative step forward. “I’ll have to check-” she suddenly stopped mid sentence as her head jerk up. </p><p>“What?” I looked at her, ears swiveling about on alert.</p><p>She turned to look behind us. “I thought I heard-,” my hand clasped around her muzzle, silencing her.</p><p>“I heard it too,” I spoke in the tiniest whisper. “Hide.”</p><p>The fireball winked out of existence as I siphoned it back, drowning the hallway in darkness once again. From memory, I felt my way to a corner near the stairs thinking that Shine was right behind me. I only realized my mistake when I heard her hoofsteps heading elsewhere away from me. I thought of calling out for her to join me but by then it was too late, already the noise we heard before was approaching. </p><p>It sounded like someone was tapping the walls and it was difficult to determine the exact location since the noise echoed off the walls. But as it got closer, louder, and clearer it sounded more and more like the familiar rhythmic hoofsteps of a pony’s trot. The closer it got the faster my heart started to beat. </p><p><i>‘You think a pony is behind this?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Does it matter if it is? If it’s a threat...’</span></p><p><i>‘Never met a violent pony before.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Doesn’t mean they don’t exist.’</span> Too little time to formulate a plan, I decided to place my faith in ponies and hope for the best. From what I’ve experienced their behaviour in general was near saintlike compared to human standards. You would expect the best of them rather than the worst. </p><p>But that doesn’t mean I was going to be foolish. I prepared myself mentally and once the source of the noise was close enough I quickly stepped out, right hand arched behind me where a fireball burst into life. </p><p>“Bronze!?” I asked in surprise, recognizing his amber fur and blue sky mane. </p><p>“Monkey?” he asked, eyes squinted against the sudden glare of light. “What-”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>CLANG!!</b></p></div><p>“Whoa!” Out of nowhere something metallic stuck him hard squarely on his face. I turned to see Shine as the assailant. “Shine what the hell!?” </p><p>“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” she apologized, a dented metal tray in between her forehooves. “I panicked.”</p><p>“Brroonze Ssky issa good name,” Bronze slurred, wobbling in place before hitting the floor with a hard thump. </p><p>“Perfect,” I mumbled in dismay. I looked at Shine with an irritated look. “Where’d you get that anyway?” She turned and following her gaze I saw a cart by the wall behind her. I let out a sigh and kneeled over him with the fireball still in one hand. “Bronze,” I called shaking his body hoping to rouse him up. But only made his tongue fall out to the side, making his unconscious form comical.  </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘That’s one hell of a swing.’</span></p><p>“What do we do now?” Shine asked with guilt in her voice. I scanned the area. </p><p><i>‘We have to assume whoever, whatever, did this is still around.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You’re not planning on hunting-oh thank god you’re not.’</span></p><p><i>‘Don’t celebrate just yet. We still need to make sure everyone of these ponies are safe. Can’t just leave them laying out in the open. We’ll have to mo-’</i> </p><p>My bones nearly jumped right out of my skin when the silence was suddenly shattered with a series of loud metallic clanging as I assumed Shine had dropped the tray.</p><p>I turned. “Jesus Shine that-” I nearly choke on the words when I saw her. Shine was laying on her side with her mane covering her face seemingly passed out. My first impulse was to lunge right to her side and check on her, but that was instantly killed when I saw something stood over her. </p><p>A jet black cat with bright yellow eyes stared at me, front paws on Shine’s neck like a lion claiming a kill. Visually there was nothing odd about the feline, it was a black cat and nothing more. But my instinct thought otherwise.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Run! Run!! RUN!!!’</span></p><p>My heart raced, blood pumping so hard I could hear it rushing in my ears. My hands started to shake and heavy sense of dread gripped my chest. But despite all that, I didn’t move. No matter how hard I wanted to, no matter how loud the voice in my head screamed.</p><p>All I could do was stare at those yellow haunting eyes. The longer I stared, the more it seemed to grow as if I was falling into it. Soon nothing seem to exist except for those mesmerizing eyes. Moments passed and I vaguely remembered a falling sensation and the last thing I remembered was seeing the floor rise up to me. </p><p>I blacked out before I felt the ground hit me. </p><hr/><p>“Ponyville Hospital,” Crea read aloud. </p><p>With the moon out it was easy for her eagle eyes to read the sign even from a far distance. Beyond it was a large rectangular building, much like the ones in larger cities like Manehattan. It was rare for her to visit such large cities, whether that be in her homeland or anywhere else. It all looked and felt boring to her, and she could barely stand the constant bustling noise. The wilds and untamed lands were her element, much like laboratories and magic was to Inquest. </p><p>Everything looked peaceful enough, nothing stood out to Crea as she descended towards the front entrance. Yet something in her gut made her feel uneasy, and it only grew the closer she approached the building. She noted light from the second floor, indicating that there was at least one staff still working tonight. </p><p>“Hello?” Crea called just before her paws touched the ground. She waited outside the glass double doors for a moment, waiting for somepony to come out. But nopony showed up, the area past the double doors remain pitch black. Crea called several more times, each louder than before, but saw no movement or heard any reply. </p><p>Her instincts have been poking at her for sometime now, an air of uneasiness seem to radiate from the structure. The front portion of her body, one covered in feathers puffed up in wary aggression as she slowly approached the front doors. </p><p>Silently she pushed the doors open and stepped inside. Waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dark, Crea started sniffing the air for any noticeable scent. Her sense of smell was nothing to brag about, but it still proved helpful at times to take in as many clues as possible before venturing into the unknown. Not that it mattered however, the hospital was overflowing with antibacterial and medicinal fragrance that made it impossible to smell anything else. Drawing her claws in so as to not tap and scrape the hard floor, she ventured forth into the dark. </p><p>The front desk was empty, but there were signs that ponies were here today. Even a cup of what could be tea lay full, though it has long gone cold. She strained her eyes, scanning the walls for any noticeable protrusion that might indicate a gem for the lights. Spotting a slight glint near a corner, she approached it while keeping alert of her surrounding. </p><p>Once close enough Crea found what she was looking for, an amethyst cut to an octagonal shape was half embedded against the wall. Making sure she was well and truly safe, Crea reached out with a claw and tapped the gem. Instantly the all the gems along the ceiling came to life and illuminated the hallway. </p><p>“Break my beak,” Crea swore under her breath. Her vision was blurred at first against the sudden brilliance, but she could still make out the multitude of ponies lying on the floor. </p><p>Claws sprang forth, wings spread out and feathers puffed out instinctively; making her look even larger than before and far more menacing. Her new demeanor screamed of danger as she prepared for battle, experienced eyes glancing about her newly illuminated surrounding for any adversary. </p><p>Finding none, Crea then leaped over tables and avoided carts to reach the nearest pony; a doctor she assumed as he wore a white robe. Keeping her head high and watchful of danger, Crea pressed a calw gently down on the pony’s chest for signs of life. Relieved to feel it push back as the pony drew breath, Crea moved to the next one. </p><p>Strangely though, she found no noticeable injuries or marks of any kind. Neither was there any sign of a struggle or fight, it’s as if these ponies simply fell unconscious as they go about their business for no apparent reason. </p><p>As much as she wanted to Crea didn’t have time to check every one of them. After confirming the third pony, a patient, was alive with no noticeable injuries, Crea assumed they were all in a similar state. In a mad rush Crea bounded over ponies in search of the human, scarring the floor with her talons and claws. </p><p>“Human!!” she yelled, checking every door she passed by. “Rodney!” She had no clue which room the human occupied, and there were too many to check them all. There was however one place that stood out for her; the single lit area on the second floor she saw during her descent.</p><p>Leaping over stairs and dashing to the proper side of the building, Crea eventually found her way into that particular hallway. There were four doors for her to choose but luckily one of them was ajar. The door slammed and cracked the wall as Crea burst inside with full force. Finding the room empty, Crea started examining the room for any hints and signs that might help her. Books, strands of fur and bits of food on the floor indicated this room was recently occupied. She could tell there were roughly three or four ponies have been in this room recently, but saw no sign of the human’s whereabouts. </p><p>It finally occurred to her that she has never seen the human or a picture of him. A hairless monkey was all the description she had going. </p><p>“Stupid,” she cursed, a claw slapping the side of her face. Her only idea left was to try find any tracks outside, as luck would have it the moonlight should be enough for her to work. </p><p>But first, Inquest needed to know. </p><p>The window unfortunately could only slide open halfway, which is far too small for Crea’s massive frame. But that didn’t deter her, rather it made the solution simple for her. With a small running start, Crea tightened her muscles, tucked her head in, and leaped out the window; shattering glass and even taking bits of the wall with her through sheer physical force. </p><p>She free falled along with the debris for about half a second before spreading her wings. Instead of beating her wings against the fall and injuring her wings with the sudden weight, she kept falling for a second longer to gain speed before swerving her wing and soaring right back up into the air in a giant U shape. </p><p>Returning to the library would take too long. If the human or the ‘visitor’ left any trail, she would need to find and track it while it’s fresh. Crea kept beating her wings and climbing higher and higher towards town until she saw the rooftop of every building. She breathed out calmly before drawing her head back and sucked in the cold night air, filling her lungs to the brink and unleashing it all in a single massive cry.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a class="embed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33DWqRyAAUw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33DWqRyAAUw</a></p></div><hr/><p>“Woah nelly!” Applejack stared out the window to the sky. “That’s a loud one.”</p><p>“You can say that again,” Spike added, scanning the skies next to Applejack. </p><p>“Was that one your hawks dear?” Rarity asked.</p><p>“Uhm, I...I don’t think so,” Fluttershy replied. For a pony who spent more time with animals than her fellow kind, Fluttershy could easily tell the subtle difference. “And, uhm, that’s not a hawk’s cry. The pitch is different. But that’s what I think,” she quickly added.</p><p>“That’s a…,” Rainbow let out a long yawn, “gryphon’s cry.” She blinked several times before another yawn. “I feel fun...ny….” Her eyes closed as she fell forward to the floor. </p><p>“Rainbow? Are you,” Rarity too let out a long yawn. “Strange, why do I feel..so tir..” She wobbled for a few steps before collapsing to the floor in a deep sleep. </p><p>“Rarity?” Twilight called worriedly. In quick succession, Spike and every one of her friends followed fell to the floor unconscious. “Girls!? Spike!?” she called alarmed, trotting towards them. </p><p>“They’re fine,” Inquest spoke, eyes closed in concentration. “Just asleep.” </p><p>Twilight turned to her old instructor and saw his horn glowing ghost white. “You did this?” Twilight asked, the tiniest hint of threat in her voice. “Why!?”</p><p>“You’ve always been proud of your mastery in teleportation,” he spoke ignoring Twilight’s glare. “Can you teleport them all and yourself to Canterlot?”</p><p>“Canterlot? Now wait a minute what is going-” Twilight started only to be interrupted.</p><p>“CAN YOU OR CAN YOU NOT!?” Inquest suddenly shouted. His voice and sudden shift in demeanor more than startled Twilight. </p><p>“M-maybe near the city limits,” she answered, faltering under his air of authority. Never before has she seen him like this. </p><p>“That’s good enough.” Inquest’s horn glowed again and one by one each sleeping mare started to float in the air. </p><p>“What are you planning to do to them?” she asked, stepping in between him and her friends with her own horn aglow. The sight of her friends unconscious form under the mercy of another pony quickly dispelled Inquest’s intimidation. </p><p>“Protecting them,” he answered. “Now don’t bother me I’m concentrating.” What looked like thin shimmering cloth started to pour out from his horn, each heading towards one of the Elements. Without touching they wrapped over each mare encasing them in a translucent glowing white bubble while they continue to hover. “That should be enough,” he sighed, the glow of his horn disappearing. </p><p>“What is going on!?” Twilight finally shouted, unable to contain her frustration and worry. </p><p>“What you heard before was Crea. That was her emergency call. She went to the hospital to check on the human,” Inquest explain hurriedly. “Something must’ve happened.”</p><p>One thing sprang to mind. “Is it Rodney? What-”</p><p>“I don’t know but Crea deemed it an emergency. I can’t explain everything now but I need to go meet her there.” </p><p>“I’ll come-”</p><p>“NO!” Inquest interrupted again. Twilight nearly fell on her haunches as Inquest again exerted his air of authority unto her. “The reason I kept you awake is so that you can take yourself and the elements to safety should things turn for the worse.” Inquest gazed down for a moment in thought before looking back at Twilight. “In two hours; if I don’t return you will take your friends and teleport to Canterlot. Head immediately to my chambers and stay there, all the runes and enchantments I made should keep you all safe. Inside my desk is a white folded letter, give it to Celestia or Luna. It will explain everything. Do you understand?” </p><p>“I’m not going anywhere until I know Rodney and Shine is safe!!” she shouted back, matching his glare. “If they're in danger then my friends and I am coming with you!” They way she suddenly stood up against the stallion surprised both Inquest and herself, but he did not relent. </p><p>“I am The Professor!” he spoke in a commanding tone. “With the rights and authority vested unto me by the throne of Equestria, I order you to follow my commands!”</p><p>“You can’t order me around like that!” Twilight shouted back, standing her ground. “I’m not my brother, I’m not in the service! I’m a citizen and I can do what I want! In fact <i>you</i> broke the laws of ‘Rightful Magic’, section E paragraph two, when you cast a spell on my friends without their consent!” There was a moment of silence as the two glared at each other’s eyes.</p><p>“You are the Elements of Harmony,” Inquest spoke in a soft voice, hoping a different tactic might work. “I know you think you can take anything on after Discord and the Changeling invasion, but this is different.” </p><p>“Rodney is my responsibility. The Princess trusted to-”</p><p>“And she trusts me to do what is necessary to keep Equestria safe,” Inquest interrupted. “I am not your enemy Twilight. At this very moment the human could be in danger.” Before Twilight could speak Inquest continued on. “I promise, on my life and tittle, that I will do everything I can to keep the human safe. I promise.”</p><p>Twilight looked at him in thought, then at her friends, and finally out the window towards the hospital. “Magic doesn’t work on him,” she informed, trusting the mentor she once looked up to. </p><p>“I know. I’ve read all your reports.” Inquest smiled mischievously. “Communication through dragon fire is not as secure as you think.” With that Inquest’s whole body started to glow. A brilliant flash later, he was disappeared. </p><p>Twilight, now alone, turned to her sleeping friends still suspended in the air, cradled inside Inquest’s protective bubble. Her horn glowed as she levitated Spike’s sleeping basket down from the second floor and placed the young dragon in it. With nothing else to do she trotted and sat by the window, one that allowed her to look towards the general direction of the hospital. </p><p>With a heavy sigh she looked down at her right fore hoof. It glowed as she parted her fur with magic to reveal a small band of metal perfectly hidden underneath. It was exactly half a centimeter wide, with tiny yet extremely detailed carvings of runes. Individually she recognized each rune, but the intricacy of the design as a whole was mind boggling. How it functions was still a mystery to her. </p><p>Rarity would no doubt adore such a beautiful looking accessory. But to Twilight who knew the its secret connection to Rodney, the metal band felt a thousand times heavier on her hoof. Despite how much she wished to reveal all of it to the human, her adoration and trust for Celestia was stronger; and so, have kept silent and lied to one who trusts her completely. If he really was in danger, Twilight might not have an opportunity to apologize.  </p><p>“Please be alright.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Elsewhere, far from Ponyville]=========</p></div><p>“Ngah!” I woke up in a gasp, shivering as a freezing wind blew over me. The next thing that greeted me was the strong scent of earth followed by grass poking on my skin. I was laying on my left side, arm under me which had gone numb from the restricted blood flow. Immediately the prickling sensation of pins and needles assaulted my arm as nerves returned to life. </p><p>Once it subsided, I pushed myself up causing my side to hurt. Breathing was also difficult, the bone chilling air making my lung and throat protest in pain. There were dust and dirt covering the lower half of my body and even a few pebbles in between buttcheeks. My whole body shook uncontrollably as I brushed them off, trying its best to warm itself up. As if that wasn't bad enough I only had my hospital gown to wear, which was nothing but a single thin piece of cloth. Might as well be naked. </p><p>Looking around I found myself standing in a field of tall untended grass that seem to continue on forever. With the moon still hanging high in the night sky, I could make out was looked like the tree line of a dense forest to my left. But other than that there was no notable landmarks that I recognized. Hugging and rubbing myself to create some friction and warmth, I continue to scan my surroundings hoping to see something that might indicate where I am. It didn’t take long for me to spot a tall mountain far off into the distance with lights glowing off the mountainside. </p><p>Canterlot. Or at least that’s what I assume unless there’s another town and castle nestled on the side of a mountain. Imagining the distance between Ponyville and Canterlot, and adjusting how far that mountain appear to be; I guessed that I was about a mile or two away from Ponyville, the furthest I’ve ever been. But really it was all guesswork, something to convince myself that I wasn’t completely lost. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘About time you wake up.’</span> </p><p>“How the hell did I get-” The moment I asked all the memory from the hospital, the silence, the unconscious ponies, Shine knocking out Bronze, and finally; the cat. From sudden fear I reflexively drew both hands out to the side, a ball of blue fire the size of baseballs in each open hand shining out like miniature suns in the dark. The metallic jingling sounds of my chains echoed across the night like bells. If that thing was nearby, it knows I’m awake now.  </p><p>“The hell happened to me?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Can’t say, you just passed out while staring at that thing. And no I don’t know how we got here. Same minds remember? When you’re unconscious-’</span></p><p>“Yeah I get it.” I slowly turned around, using the light from the fireballs to try and spot any danger. Specifically a black cat. At least the sudden adrenaline was making my heart beat harder, the rush of blood was helped warm my body. “What the hell was that thing?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Definitely not a normal cat. Definitely dangerous.’</span></p><p>“How’d you-”</p><p>“Hihihi.” I spun around to look back at the sudden noise where I saw the grass stir. Unmoving, I watched the scene wary of any sign of movement, ready to throw a fireball if I needed to.  </p><p>After a long tense moment of silence, I couldn’t handle the anxiety and fear any longer.  </p><p>“Who are you!?” I screamed into the dark. “The hell do you want from me!?” I waited but nothing happened. “I know you’re out there!”</p><p>“Here I am,” whispered a husky voice right next to my ear. </p><p>Out of surprise I mindlessly jumped forward, twisted my body and threw both fireballs. The fractured rib and my sudden twist left me in agony. Rather than landing back on my feet, I tumbled over from the excruciating pain and fell to the ground just as everything flashed blue. I felt the rush of heat and the thundering explosion hit me as I lay on the dirt.</p><p>As the wind from the blast died down, I carefully picked myself up and scanned the impact zone. In the midst of a perfect verdant field of grass was a black charred crater with small fires burning on the edges of the explosion radius. Trying my best to ignore the pain I prepared another fireball in my right hand, illuminating the area once again. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Calm down! You’ll quickly dry out if you keep wasting magic like that!’</span> Heeding that advice I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm both mind and body. </p><p>“Someone likes to play rough,” spoke a female voice, seemingly reverberating from every direction. </p><p>“Show yourself,” I replied in a low tone. The voice giggled lightheartedly from all around, making it impossible to pinpoint its location. </p><p>“Why should I? Clearly you’ll just hurt me.”</p><p>“Then what the hell do you want from me? Why did you attack the hospital?” There was silence at first and for a moment I thought I saw the shadows around me stir and move. </p><p>“How badly do you want to go home?”</p><p>“What?” I asked dumbfounded, surprised by the question. </p><p>“Poor, poor Rodney.” How it suddenly used my name sent a chill down my spine. “So lonely. So far from home. Trapped in a strange world with literally nothing but the clothes on your back.” </p><p>That phrase; ‘nothing but the clothes on your back’. That was a human’s phrase. It had no place in a society that uses clothes for mere accessory. Even more I sensed a teasing tone, as if it knew I would take note of this. Whatever this thing was, it knew things only I should know. </p><p>“And worse,” the voice continued, “this place has so many similarities to home, doesn’t it? Everywhere you look, you see things that remind you of everything left behind. Doorknobs, furniture, beds, books, language, letters, architecture. Prodding that heartache of yours like an open wound. No wonder it hasn’t healed.”</p><p>My breath was laboured, my head spinning with confusion while I tried to stomach an emotional hailstorm. </p><p>“You try to hide the pain. Joking around and being a good guy with those ponies. Burying yourself in magic and training, just to keep your mind busy. All for a moment of bliss. Just to forget what you’ve lost.”</p><p>“How-how do you...” My chest tightened, felt like something was gripping my insides. There was no denying it, this thing was aware of thoughts and emotion I’ve bottled up deep inside. Even those that I wasn’t aware of. With every word it forced me to face the truth of myself, every actuation striking true. It was all too much.  </p><p>“None of them know your pain. How can they? Torn from family and friends, everything you cherished. I know you hate them, deep down you’re jealous of them. These ponies, smiling everyday without a care right in front of you. Mocking you. If they only knew how much it hurts to lose everything.”</p><p>“You’re wrong! I don’t-”</p><p>“Am I?” It giggled. “They call you friend but look at you. In chains and with ponies watching over you. If only mom and dad could see you now.” The confusion and emotional turmoil that have built up finally caved in with the mention of my parents. In an explosion of rage and anguish; I lost all clarity. </p><p>“AAAAAAHHHHH!!” Mindless and full of anger, I started lobbing fireball after fireball at random directions around me. Like a lightning storm the surrounding area was bathed in flashes of blue light accompanied by the thundering roar of explosions that shattered the earth. Stone, mud, and flaming grass rained down but I paid no heed. Focused still on venting my emotions in an act of denial to everything it said. </p><p>I don’t know how long my tantrum went on or how many fireballs I threw. By the end of it all, I was down on my knees in exhaustion, clutching my side as the pain finally caught up. With my emotional turmoil mostly vented, I came to realize my mistake. </p><p>It was all gone. There no magic was left, I had used it all. It was an odd feeling, almost similar to being thirsty but different. I suppose having exposed to magic for so long, my body was starting to adapt.</p><p>“Shhhh,” the voice hushed in a soothing tone. “It’s ok. I understand how you feel.”</p><p>“How…,” I spoke, kneeled down with my head hanging heavy. “How can you possibly-”</p><p>“Because we’re the same you and I.” </p><p>The grass, what remained of it, suddenly stirred all around me. At first I thought the moonlight was playing with my head, shadows was rising up from the ground like black smoke. It started to move around me in a circle and picking up speed, growing thicker and darker till it trapped me inside a tube of whirling darkness. Expecting an attack, I picked myself up and on reflex tried to bring forth another fireball. A small blue light flickered in my hand for the briefest moment before it vanished. </p><p>I was defenseless. Nothing but my fist to fight back. But what happened next was simply beyond what I knew and comprehend. </p><p>This darkness that surrounded me started to brighten, turning grey before slowly taking on a blueish hue. As the seconds passed, this bluish veil began to give off light. What was shadow and darkness moments before, was now misty flames of bright blue that looked all too similar to my magic. </p><p>“Wh-what...” I mumbled confusedly, unable to think. </p><p>The voice didn’t reply. Rather the tornado of fire began to gather in front of me, collecting into a mass of flames as if sucked by an invisible vacuum. And just when you think things can’t get any stranger, well, it did; into a whole different level. </p><p>As the flames continue to gather, it condensed and slowly took on a physical shape. It looked like a small tentacle at first, growing for several centimeters before another one grew next to it. For some time I expected some kind of monster to appear before me. But once a thicker and shorter tendril grew at a different angle, did I finally recognized for what it was. </p><p>A hand. </p><p>Not a hoof, not a claw, or any other kind of limb; but a hand. A real, five digited, human hand. You would think that after so long without contact or seeing another fellow human, or part of it, that I would be ecstatic. But no, instead I was utterly confused and terrified. </p><p>Hardly drawing a breath with my jaw hanging slack, I watched with eyes wide open as the hand grew into an arm. Followed by an elbow, a shoulder, further and further taking on more distinct features of a human with every passing second. </p><p>My mind was so out of it that I didn’t realize how feminine everything looked. Not until a pair of naked breasts formed followed by a slender frame which led to long perfectly shaped legs. The last was the head; aside from being made out of azure fire, it was the only part that appeared inhuman.</p><p>The neck and face was human enough; lips, cheekbones, nose, and a pair of closed eyelids. But everything from the top to the back of her head was still of fire, flowing and burning as a fire does; it actually resembled Celestia and Luna’s flowing mane. The moment her eyes opened though, it felt like my brain was struck with lightning. </p><p>I know that face.</p><p>My knees went weak and I fell back down to the earth. It took all my conscious effort to keep myself in a kneeling position and not fall over. Starring up I could do nothing but look into her eyes, completely forgetting that a naked woman stood in front of me, or that she was blue and made of fire. Only that face, that beautiful face. She gazed down at me and the edge of her lips lifted into a small smile. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/7f65a95f5417e3f62a15c7b05278967e22548ea8?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Ff87ncXe.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN: Credit for the art is here (<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Fire-Vampire-286301314" rel="nofollow">link</a>).

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>A very special chapter<br/>Not edited. </p><hr/><p>“We ready for this?” I asked.</p><p>The two men seated across from me looked at each other quizzically. To the left was Andy Grey, dressed in a simple yet elegant suit with groomed hair. He carried himself with an air of grace and proper manner. The other, Holly, was practically the opposite; jeans and a t-shirt with a long sleeved business shirt over it. His disheveled hair worked well with his overall appearance which further strengthen his laid back personality. </p><p>Me? Well you could say I’m a bit of both. </p><p>We were all inside a lavish study room, the kind most would imagine when they think of manors from England. Books lining up the wall, a fireplace at the center, a small coffee table nearby, and four leather seats to which three are occupied by us. However there is one oddity in the room; a door with it’s frame standing upright some distance away. It wasn’t installed into the walls or anything, just a door with it’s frame randomly placed in the room. </p><p>“I still say this is a bad idea,” Andy spoke. “Considering what you’ve done to him and all.”</p><p>“Ditto,” Holly added. </p><p>“Oh sure he might be a bit upset.” I smiled and looked at the door expectedly. “But c’mon, you gotta admit this is pretty cool right?” They glanced at each other before nodding at the same time. “Alright then, let’s get this started.”</p><p>I reached over the side of the chair and pulled out my laptop, nothing fancy but decent enough to get stuff done. As it woke up from sleep mode I immediately opened my writing software and started typing earnestly. </p><p>“You really think this is going to work?” I heard Holly whisper. </p><p>“He certainly thinks so,” Andy answered. </p><p>There was a pause before Holly spoke again. “I think he needs help.”</p><p>“I can hear you,” I told them. “And done.” I closed the laptop and stared at the door expectantly. Andy and Holly stared at it too but with mixed feelings, like watching someone attempt to do something that was clearly a bad idea. </p><p>“I don’t think this will work,” Andy finally spoke after some time. </p><p>“Give it a minute,” I argued, eyes glued to the handle. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>CLICK</p></div><p>The sound of the handle turning echoed across the room. And and Holly had a look of surprise and confusion while I was smiling from ear to ear. By all reason we should see the other side of the room through the door, but instead there appears to be nothing but whiteness behind it. The room brightened as the door swung open, revealing a young man modestly dressed with long pants, a simple shirt, and a light blue jacket to top it all off. </p><p>He had a piece of paper in his hand and was busy reading it to notice the three of us, or the fact that he had just crossed dimensions. </p><p>“Twilight are you sure about….this…...” His voice slowed as he finally took notice of his surrounding, and us. “What dafuq?”</p><p>“Hello Rodney,” I greeted excitedly. </p><p>“Screw me sideways!” Holly cursed. </p><p>“Well I’ll be,” Andy mumbled in a more controlled surprise. “It actually worked.”</p><p>“You guys are human,” Rodney spoke eyes wide. “Am…,” he looked around the room, “am I back?”</p><p>“Uuhh, yes and no,” I answered. </p><p>He looked at me, eyeing me up and down before doing the same to Andy and Holly. “Who are you people?”</p><p>“Well,” I started. “Those two there are Andy and Holly.” I leaned forward and looked at him in the eye. “And I’m Zai, your creator.”</p><p>His surprised expression disappeared, replaced but a look that asked ‘are you stupid?’. “The hell do you mean by that?”</p><p>I gestured to the fourth chair. “Take a seat. This will take a while to explain.”</p><p>“I’d rather stand thank you,” he replied suspiciously. </p><p>“If you say so.” I cleared my throat and began to explain. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>==========[A long time later]==========</p></div><p>“Ok, so I’m just an imaginary character in your fiction,” Rodney finally conceded, after I finally convinced him of the truth; with help from Andy and Holly. </p><p>“Yup,” I replied. </p><p>“And you’re my creator, the author.”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>Rodney closed his eyes and rubbed them as if fighting a headache while exhaling a sigh. He did that several times as the facts slowly sink in while Andy, Holly, and I waited patiently. </p><p>“Am I correct to assume,” he finally spoke, “as the author you control everything?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“.....Including all the pain and hardship?” He asked but the way he looked at me showed he had already figured it out. </p><p>“Here we go,” I heard Holly whisper. </p><p>“All the times my junk was crushed like a nut is on you?!”</p><p>“I-” Before I could say another word Rodney suddenly ran at me, his right hand pulled back with a fist. It hit me square in the face with enough force to flip the chair, sending me rolling off uncomfortably close to the fireplace. But Rodney didn’t stop there, I felt his hand on my legs as he pulled and continued beating me. </p><p>Holly leaned towards Andy with an open hand. “Called it.” Andy merely grumbled as he pulled out his wallet and handed Holly a twenty dollar bill. </p><p>“Imma fucking kill you!!” Rodney screamed, punching me in a mad craze.</p><p>Andy looked at the fight with worry. “We better stop him before he really does kill Zai.”</p><p>“Ah give it a few more seconds,” Holly suggested with a smile.</p><p>“Fuck you Holl-ah!!”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>==========[Several struggles later]==========</p></div><p>“So what the hell do you want from me?” Rodney asked, seated on his chair while still glaring at me with murderous intent. I had to admit, I didn’t think he was going to go that far. But still; a black eye, a bleeding lip, and a tissue shoved up one nostril, it was still worth it. </p><p>Seeing as I was still recovering from the assault to answer, Andy started to explain. “It’s his birthday.”</p><p>“Basically,” Holly interrupted, “his wish was to meet you in person.” Rodney turned to Holly with a surprised expression. “I know right!? Personally I would’ve wished for a car or something materialistic like a normal person.”</p><p>Rodney looked at me again and chuckled. “The hell do you want to meet me for? Considering you created me and all.”</p><p>“Is it really such a surprise?” I finally spoke with a grimace. “Haven’t you ever wished to meet your favorite character in a book or a movie? I’ve only started writing recently and I’ve realized that it’s the same for authors.” I stood up and, with some caution, approached Rodney. “Authors would love to meet the characters they’ve poured so much heart in.” I raised a hand to him in greeting. “You have no idea how happy this makes me.”</p><p>Rodney stared at my open, somewhat injured hand in silence. “Well, I suppose the very least I could do is wish you happy birthday.” He reached out and shook my hand. “Happy birthday Zai.”</p><p>“Happy birthday you bastard!” Holly yelled joyfully, slapping my back. </p><p>“Happy birthday Zai,” Andy congratulated. “May good health follow you.”</p><p>I gave them all a grateful smile. “Thank you everyone.” I turned my attention back to Rodney. “But I think it’s time for you to go back.”</p><p>He turned and looked at each of us, then at the room. “None of this is real is it?”</p><p>“What makes you say that?” I asked. </p><p>“Like you said, I’m nothing but your imagination. This is probably a dream you're having.”</p><p>I chuckled. “I did make you to be smart and sharp.” I pulled the tissue out of my nose, the edge stained with blood. “If it is, this is the most realistic dream ever.” I pulled him into a hug. “But even if it is, doesn't mean it I can't appreciate it any less.”</p><p>When I released him, everything was gone. The room was gone, Holly was gone, and Andy was gone. I find myself in an infinite expanse of white, with nothing but me, Rodney, and that simple door from before waiting to the side. </p><p>It creaked open just a tiny bit and I could hear all kinds of noises and chatter. Most noticeably the sound of many hoofsteps.</p><p>“Looks like that’s for me,” Rodney spoke with a heavy sigh. </p><p>“I suppose that is.” I watched him walk towards the door and grabbed the handle. Just before he pulled it open, he turned and looked at me.</p><p>“I hate to ask but,” he hesitated, “how popular am I?”</p><p>The question caught me by surprised and made me laugh hard. “Ah Rodney, does it matter?” I look at him straight in the eye. “Even if everyone suddenly stopped reading, I will never stop writing. I can’t stop.” </p><p>He smiled, turned, and walked through.</p>

<p>First of all, yes this is my birthday. Basically I was asked the inevitable question; &quot;What do you want for your birthday?&quot; And well, meeting Rodney was really the first thing that popped in my head. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I thought, how cool would that be. </p><p>This chapter was basically created following that line of thought. Even though I wrote this more for myself, I still hope you all enjoyed it. Also, since I wrote this spontaneously, I never asked Andy or Holly (my editors) whether or not I can use them. I certainly hope they don't mind, the way I portrayed them is basically what I imagine them to be in my head. Which also means all this is unedited, so any help is greatly appreciated. </p><p>And before you ask, yes I have been writing the new chapter. It's a hard one to write, already re-written it three times now.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 41 - One day you’ll find out<br/>Edited by AndyGrey<br/>Pre-read by AndyGrey, Zanthimos, StormScorpion</p><p>AN: The most rewritten chapter yet. </p><hr/><p>“Are you certain this is the way?” Inquest shouted. Even with his muzzle close to the gryphon’s ear, it was still difficult to hear anything over the roaring winds. Riding on her back, the old stallion tightened his hold as Crea beat her wings to maintain altitude. </p><p>“Drag marks lead this way,” she shouted back. “It’s the only fresh track I found moving away from the hospi-” Before she could finish, there was a sudden flash of blue light on the ground some distance away. It lasted for only for an instant but in the dark of night it was easily detected, especially considering the booming sound that came seconds after; like thunder. </p><p>“How long?” Inquest asked. </p><p>Crea gazed down towards the area where the flashes had originated, a clearing near the edge of a forest. “Ten,” Crea answered with laboured breath, “maybe fifteen minutes.” </p><p>Silence followed after as both prepared themselves for the coming encounter. As a strategist, Inquest’s mind raced with calculations and simulations. As strong as Crea was, carrying a full grown pony on her back in flight would take too much out of her. She would need time to recuperate in order to be effective in battle. Meaning Inquest would have to fend, rescue the human, and somehow capture the elusive creature all on his own; which he has yet figure out how. </p><p>Not the worst or the most challenging situation Inquest had been through, but then again, those occurred decades ago during his younger years. </p><p>About a minute or two later, while Inquest was still formulating his plan, there came more thundering explosions. These explosions appeared repeatedly one after the other as if unending. The closer Crea flew, the more they were able to discern. These explosions of bluish flames seem to originate from small, similarly colored balls of fire, thrown by a tall dark figure in the center of the destruction. </p><p>The human. </p><p>“Looks like he’s putting up a fight,” Crea said. </p><p>At first glance, Inquest too presumed the same, but a closer look showed otherwise. “No, I don’t think so.” The pattern and direction of the explosions suggested the human wasn’t aiming for anything in particular; it was all too random. </p><p>“At least our approach is covered,” Crea noted. “With that much noise they won’t hear us coming.”</p><p>“He’s a fool,” Inquest replied. </p><p>“What?” Crea asked confused. </p><p>“What is he thinking?” he said. “He’s not accomplishing anything! If he keeps that up...” Inquest never finished that sentence; he didn’t have to. His intention became clear to Crea minutes later, when the intensity of the explosions became noticeably weaker. It wasn’t long before it stopped, as Inquest had likely guest. </p><p>The human had run out of magic and was now defenseless.</p><p>“Hurry,” Inquest commanded. Crea obeyed quickening the beat of her wings, and ignoring her body’s exhausted protests. Suddenly her wings rotated against the wind, causing Inquest to lurch forward and nearly lose his hold. “What-” he started when Crea cut in. </p><p>“Something’s happening,” she explained, eagle eyes focused on the area around the human. Following her gaze, Inquest strained his eyes. </p><p>Unfortunately, the moon had moved behind thick high clouds and offered little light. However, the human’s destruction upon the grassfield around him had created a few small fires. Dotted all around, their combined light made it possible for both gryphon and pony to see through the dark of night. </p><p>“What…,” was all Inquest could say at what he witnessed. For a moment it looked as if the ground itself was rising to swallow the human. Only after the surprise died down did Inquest understand what had transpired. </p><p>Shadows were rising up from the earth around the human, rising like smoke yet moving with purpose. With every passing second the dark substance thickened and it continue to circle the human like a brewing storm. Inquest and Crea quickly lost sight of the human, swallowed whole by the dark smokey substance. </p><p>“What do we do?” Crea asked urgently, still flying towards the human but at a slow and cautious speed. </p><p>“Keep your course,” he replied immediately. “It doesn’t matter if we can’t reach him in time to hel-” Inquest froze when he noticed a change. </p><p>The darkness surrounding the human seemed to lighten as the color shifted, but the distance made it difficult to know for sure. Not that it mattered, soon the change became so dramatic it was impossible to miss. The color of the substance turned from the black of night to a bluish hue. The most significant however, was how its physical appearance seem to have changed as well. When it rose from the earth it resembled dark wispy smoke; now it took on the form of flames dancing in the air. </p><p>“Fire,” Crea said irritably. “Why does it have to be fire.” But that wasn’t the end of it. The flames started to concentrate into a solid form. “Is that…Is that another human?”</p><p>“Fascinating,” Inquest spoke in wonder, his mind racing with theories. </p><p>Changelings can mask their appearance with magic for the purpose of infiltration and deception. Yet it is still restricted by its physical form, meaning they can only take on the appearance of ponies and not, for instance, a diamond dog or gryphon.</p><p>But it seemed this creature had no such limitations. The creature had no physical form - or to be more precise - its body was made up of this malleable substance. Something akin to gas and liquid. Should that be the case, then it could take on the form of any creature or race by simply molding itself to that form. Add the fact that it could also hold its victims in a powerful mental hold... </p><p>“The perfect deceiver,” Inquest whispered in awe. </p><p><i>‘But how could such a being function?’</i> he pondered. <i>‘How does it eat, live, or even reproduce?’</i> Inquest shook his head, clearing his mind of that train of thought. Questions like that could wait; the current situation required his full attention. </p><p>“Inquest? Is that another human?” Crea asked again.</p><p>“No,” Inquest answered. “Believe me, we’d know if another human existed.”</p><p>“So I’m guessing that thing is-”</p><p>“The other visitor, yes,” Inquest finished. </p><p>“So what do we do?” she asked. “What’s the plan?”</p><p>Inquest thought for a moment. “Land.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“We land. Here. Now,” he repeated. </p><p>Crea hesitated. They were close, but still a good distance away. It would take too long for them to reach the human, should he require their aid. At least for her, Crea had to remind herself that Inquest was with her. Distances like this meant nothing to him. “Where?”</p><p>“There, on that hill.” Looking down, Crea saw a small hill covered in tall grass much like those in the field below. From that vantage point they would have excellent vision over the entire field. </p><p>Crea descended silently, gliding in circles towards a suitable area behind the hill. With Inquest on her back, their landing was louder and rougher than what she would prefer. Quickly yet silently, Inquest got off and inspected his partner’s condition. As expected carrying his weight on her back had cost her too much. Crea was panting heavily, her fur sticking unto her body with sweat and wings hanging loosely on the side. </p><p>“Will you be alright?” he asked worriedly. </p><p>“Aww you still care,” she replied jokingly before talking in a more serious tone. “Gimme a breather and I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Inquest gave her a nod before crawling ahead over the hill. As expected the elevated position gave Inquest a perfect view of both human and shapeshifter. Furthermore, this human-like appearance was giving off an eerie blue glow; making it easier to observe them both. So far the creature had yet to attack the human. It seemed more interested in conversing at the moment. </p><p>“Now what?” Crea asked, suddenly appearing next to him. Even when exhausted she still managed to sneak up in perfect silence. </p><p><i>‘What to do indeed,’</i> Inquest thought. One part of him wanted to ensure the human’s safety; which he could accomplish by immediately engaging the creature and having Crea take the human away. But that impulse was quickly quelled by his dominantly, logical side. Simply diving into the fray with no preparation or foreknowledge could easily result in all their deaths. Besides, merely saving the human would not eliminate the true threat. </p><p>This creature, whatever it was, had to be dealt with. Either put down or captured. Failure to do so now might cause the creature to go into hiding. It would also force it to plan more cautiously, which meant it would be far more dangerous. Additionally, with the way it had mentally controlled a dragon and coerced it to attack, a notion once thought impossible, clearly meant that it had hostile intent. Should key individuals become victims, it would plunge Equestria and likely the rest of the world into chaos. </p><p>Such an event would no doubt unleash a far greater threat. </p><p><i>‘For the greater good?’</i> Inquest pondered. Of course he remembered his promise to Twilight, to save the human. But should he prioritize the human over the fate of the world? The answer to him was clear and yet he still hesitated.</p><p>“We wait,” he finally decided, causing Crea to look at him incredulously. “We wait,” he repeated in a tone that left no room for argument. “Till the last second. For the opportune moment to strike.”</p><hr/><p>“That’s…. No, that’s impossible.” Breaths came in so ragged it sounded like I was having an asthma attack. In fact, with all the emotional turmoil, confusion, and now this; I wouldn't be surprise if I was falling into some sort of shock. </p><p>Here, right in front of me, glowing and burning blue, was a love from a different life. As I gazed upon her face, memories from what felt like a lifetime ago flooded my mind. </p><p>Joana Arila Fraye. </p><hr/><p>“Call me Jo.”</p><p>“C’mon, slowpoke! We’re going to miss the bus!”</p><p>“Hey Rodney wait up!”</p><hr/><p>From a boy’s crush to a man’s love. A happy go lucky girl I met in middle school, this redhead held my heart for most of my life. Call it a fool’s notion to chase love at first sight, but for me, this childish crush grew into something real as the years went by. </p><hr/><p>“Rodney, can you help me with math?”</p><p>“Oh my gosh we totally need to get these for school.”</p><p>“Rodney, can you pick me up from the mall?”</p><hr/><p>Like many young men in love, I was far too frightened and timid to do anything about it. For the longest time, I never attempted to express my feelings to her. I was content to just be close by. Didn’t even speak out when she got a boyfriend. I just smiled and pretended things were okay, no matter how painful. It wasn’t till the last year of highschool that I finally summoned enough courage to take the chance. </p><hr/><p>“Okay, what’s so important?”</p><p>“Wow, uhm, the prom? I-eh...sure. Yeah, I’ll go with you.”</p><p>“So...it finally happened, huh? After all this time, we’re actually together.”                                    </p><hr/><p>I’ll never forget that heavenly, euphoric feeling of having love answered back in full. Even years after, when we went our separate ways in life, I still felt giddy when remembering those short yet wonderful memories. Her accepting me as more than just a friend. I was one of the lucky ones. </p><hr/><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>“I love you Rodney.”</p></div><hr/><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><a class="embed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PWiDMHkW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PWiDMHkW0</a></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>AN: The music fits Jo’s theme. Plus it helps imagine how her body moves.</p></div><p>“Rodney,” she called in a loving tone. The same way she always does. </p><p>“You can’t...you can’t be here.” Strength left me, legs shaking as I fought to keep myself from falling. </p><p>“Don’t be afraid.” She stepped towards me. “It’s me.” </p><p>“Stop saying that!” I yelled. “You’re not her! You can’t be! Look at you! None of this makes sense!”</p><p>“Of course it’s me,” she replied gently, like a mother calming her child. </p><p>“You’re blue!!” I screamed louder. “You’re not even human! There’s no way you can be-”</p><p>“1376 Walesby Avenue,” she interrupted.</p><p>Hearing my address nearly made me choke. “H-how...” I hadn't shared that piece of information with anyone since I arrived in this world. The surprise caused me to slip and I tumbled, landing hard on my ass. </p><p>Before I knew it, she was already standing over me, gazing down with hair still blazing blue. She crouched next to me and reached out with a hand. On reflex I immediately brought both arms to protect myself rather pathetically, as if her touch would kill me. </p><p>Instead of being harmed, I felt her soft touch on my chest; which at the moment was bare, as the hospital gown was hanging off me by a thread. I could feel her warm touch move up to my left shoulder and stop to trace along a small scar.  </p><p>“This,” she said, “you got when we were kids. We were playing pretend in the kitchen, and you got cut because of me.” She suddenly laughed. “Your mom gave me such an earful after.”</p><p>I didn’t say anything, couldn’t do anything but stare at her with a bewildered look. </p><p>“And this one,” she continued, moving her fingers down to a burn mark behind my left thumb. “Katherine knocked over a bunsen burner in chemistry class. You jumped over tables and grabbed it with your bare hands. Miss Angela nearly fainted when she realized what happened.”</p><p>“Jo?” I stuttered, eyes starting to water. </p><p>“Yes,” she spoke. Her smile widened and she placed her hands on each side of my face. “It’s me. Your Jo.”</p><p>With that I leaped at her, wrapped my arms around her, and pulled her into a tight embrace. Nothing mattered to me in that moment. The world felt detached and became distant. To feel her skin on mine, the warmth of her body, breathing in her scent as my face pressed against her chest. </p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” I cried over and over again, bawling my eyes out like a baby. All the while she stayed silent, wrapped her own arms around me gently. Why was I begging for forgiveness? I didn’t know. Maybe I was apologizing for leaving her and everybody else. Whatever the reason, I kept repeating those two words like a chant and cried for who knows how long. </p><p>“Shhh,” she hushed, gently running her fingers through my hair. “Everything’s going to be just fine.” She repositioned herself, allowing me to rest sideways against her body with my head on her shoulders. </p><p>We just laid there on the ground, surrounded by small fires that didn’t seem to bother me one bit. My sensations started to become….well, I’m not sure how to describe it. Muddled? Adrenaline was still pumping through my veins and my heartbeat was still racing fast. But strangely I felt peaceful and serene without a care. The sensation was overpowering. My head felt heavier and I wanted to just rest my head on her shoulder and let go. To surrender myself completely to her care. </p><p>“There you go.” Her voice echoed deeply in my head, each word seem to push the world further and further away. “Everything’s going to be al-”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘THAT’S NOT HER!!’</span> A sharp pain suddenly struck my head, as if someone jabbed a fork right into my brain. It only lasted for a fraction of a second but the sharp pain drew me back to reality. </p><p>“Aaagh!” I pushed her away with a yell of defiance, throwing her off me. </p><p>The sudden movement also seem to ‘reawaken’ my senses. My nervous system jolted back to life while my brain rebooted. Unfortunately that also seem to bring back the pain. Apparently my fractured rib have been screaming in pain all this time. All I could do was crawl away as I reassessed the situation. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Finally! The hell happened to you!?’</span> the voice shouted, louder than I’ve ever heard it before. </p><p>“I..I don’t...” I mumbled, struggling to stand back up while keeping on eye on this Jo look-a-like. The pain became unbearable whenever I tried to push myself off the ground. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘From the looks of it, you were about ready to sleep with that thing. What the hell makes you think that is Jo!? She’s blue and her head is on fire for crying out loud!!’</span></p><p>“I..I don’t know. I just-” Despite my attempts to keep an eye on her, all it took was a quick glance away and by the time I looked back, she was already back up. I didn’t even hear her move or anything. I expected to see anger followed by some sort of attack, but instead I saw confusion in her face as she just stared down at me. </p><p>“Well, that’s new,” she stated curiously.</p><p>I couldn’t move, didn't dare attempt anything. I was on my back on the dirt, in pain and with nothing but a hospital gown to protect myself while she was at the ready. </p><p>“For a moment there,” she continued, “I thought I heard something.” Her head tilted as she scrutinized me. “It’s yours but, at the same time, it’s...not.” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Is...Is she talking about me?’</span></p><p>She took a step forward and reached out with her hand. “Let’s take a closer look.” I didn’t like the way she said that at all. Her face showed genuine curiosity, almost childlike. It felt like she was about ready to dissect me open like a specimen.</p><p>I quickly realized that I needed to get as far away from her as possible. </p><p>However, before I could even budge, her hand suddenly stopped and she froze. Her curious expression quickly changed to one of surprise and alarm. She suddenly jumped backwards for no apparent reason, leaving me alone. </p><p>That reason became apparent when the ground she stood on suddenly exploded in a flash of white light.</p><p>The force of the explosion wasn’t anything to worry about, the chunks of earth and rock that hit me hurt more. It was the sudden brilliant light and noise that invaded my eyes and ears. Felt like a flash grenade exploded right in front of me; my vision was dancing all about in a blur while my ears rang. Luckily it only lasted a short while, and within moments most of my senses had returned and I was able make out my surroundings. </p><p>Standing in front of me, right where she’d stood, was a pony. A stallion to, be precise. For a moment, I thought it might be Bronze, once again coming out of nowhere to my rescue. But this pony was no pegasus and his fur was was all grey. What grabbed my attention most was the long horn atop his head, the longest I’ve ever seen on a pony aside from Celestia and Luna. It glowed a clear white light which, against his greyish appearance, created a ghostly aura. </p><p>“Can you stand?” the stallion asked in a deep, unfamiliar voice. His voice sounded old and carried an air of authority. </p><p>“Uh, yeah. I think so,” I answered without thinking. “Who-”</p><p>“Stay close,” he cut in. “We’ll take it from here.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘We?’</span></p><p>There came a sound of rushing wind and I caught sight of something massive fall from the sky on the other side of Jo, trapping her in between.</p><p>Gustave, the first ever gryphon met, was a sight but he was not what I expected a gryphon to be. He was more strange, and even comical. But this one, oh my god. This gryphon stood a good head or two above mine, easily taller than most if not all humans. Not only was it large, it also possessed a perfectly balanced physique. Probably weighing at least three times my own. It wore belts lined with numerous pockets all over. A few were bulging with what looked like plants. The combination of eagle and lion gave the gryphon an imposing, regal appearance. There was an undeniable air of savagery in the way it glared, demanding respect and caution. </p><p>This gryphon was the kind legends were made of.</p><p>“You two,” the imposter spoke menacingly. She hadn’t taken a readied position or prepared herself for the coming confrontation. Rather she just stood there glaring at the stallion and occasionally glancing back to the gryphon. </p><p>“Ah you remember us,” Inquest replied casually. “We weren’t properly introduced when we last met.” His head dipped a little as if he was bowing. “Professor-”</p><p>“Inquest,” she cut in. “Advisor of Magic to the throne of Equestria.” She turned her head slightly to glance back at the gryphon. “Crea Whistwind; one of the world’s most renowned hunters from the Gryphon Confederation.”</p><p><i>‘The throne? Did Celestia send them?’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Does it matter? They’re here to save our butt.’</span></p><p>Inquest, the stallion, didn’t seem bothered at all that she knew about them. “You have us at a disadvantage; you know of us, but what should we call you?”</p><p>“Call me Jo.” With a smile, she looked past him and right at me. My fingers curled into a fist as I suppressed my anger. Whoever and whatever this thing was, it seemed bent on insulting the real Jo just to aggravate me.</p><p>“Well, Jo,” he continued. “I’m going to have to ask you to come with us. I have many questions, and you have a lot to pay for with that dragon.”</p><p>“Dragon!?” I asked caught of guard. “You were behind that!?” I screamed. </p><p>“Be quiet!” Inquest hushed before turning his attention back at the impostor. “As I was saying, you’ll have to come with us.”</p><p>“Could this wait?” she replied, acting as if their sudden appearance was nothing more than an irritation. “I was having a private moment.” She looked at me again, licking her lips like I was a piece of meat. “Things were just getting interesting.”</p><p>Inquest stepped to the side and blocked her view. “He’s under my protection,” he threatened, all trace of the casual tone from before was gone. The glow from his horn intensified as he gathered more magic. “And you <i>will</i> come with us. One way, or another.”</p><p>She leaned forward and looked Inquest in the eye. “Make me.”</p><p>The tension in the air seemed to multiply, making it difficult to breathe. Inquest’s hooves spread out ever so slightly as he readied himself, while Crea, did the same. Oddly the impostor just smiled and waited. Appearing vulnerable, though there was an undeniable air of danger emanating from her. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘This might be a good time to leave.’</span> Agreeing, I slowly started to crawl away. Trying to keep myself as small as possible so as to avoid drawing attention. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>CRACK</p></div><p>But of course, in situations like this there’s always a dry twig just waiting to break. That miniscule sound seem to reverberate louder than it should in every direction. Like a match to gunpowder, all the built up tension was suddenly unleashed as everything exploded into action. </p><p>Crea was the first to act, I saw her lunge at Jo with razor sharp talons. It seemed she was hoping to quickly subdue Jo by overpowering her with her clear physical advantage. If anybody else had been in Jo’s position, they’d probably be paralyzed by fear. </p><p>But Jo didn’t seem phased at all. In the split second that all this happened, I saw her smile at the gryphon without a care in the world. Something was clearly wrong.</p><p>“Crea!” Inquest shouted. It seemed he too noticed this, but it was still too late. Crea’s momentum could not be stopped and the reason behind Jo’s calmness became apparent when Crea made contact. </p><p>Like fine dust, Jo exploded outwards into bluish flames as Crea went right through her. But these flames didn’t just stay still, they moved like a swarm, rushing towards the gryphon just as she touched the ground. She swiped the flames with her talons but they merely parted away like water before she was enveloped by it. </p><p>“Crea!” I heard Inquest shout again. His horn ignited as a wave of ghostly white light burst forth from the tip. As best as I can describe it, the light rushed outwards and grew dramatically like a wave towards the flames. It literally looked as if the light was washing and pushing the flames away, revealing Crea collapsed sideways on the ground. </p><p>She stirred and quickly got back up, though with a noticeable grogginess in her movement. No doubt something happened but there were no discernable signs of injury on her. </p><p>“Are you alright?” Inquest asked worriedly. </p><p>Crea blinked a few times as if having trouble keeping her eyes open. “I don’t know what happened but…she nearly knocked me out there.”</p><p>“I think she did the same to me,” I said without thinking. Both regarded me for a second. “That’s what happened in the hospital. I just blacked out.”</p><p>“But magic seems to work at least,” Inquest added, mostly to himself. There was a slight change in the way his eyes looked that showed a sudden conviction and determination. “Crea stay with him. And if anything happens, take him safely away.”</p><p>“Inquest,” Crea called in a slow, worried tone, “don’t. We have the number advantage.”</p><p>“Unless you can spontaneously use magic I don’t see how you can fight her,” Inquest replied coldly. “Don’t interfere.” With that, his horn glowed brightly once again before he stepped towards the flames, leaving Crea and me to watch. </p><p>“You know,” I started, “we could just run away.” I would love to get my hands around her neck after all that’s happened. Especially if what Inquest said about her being responsible for Falnor was true. But still, considering the situation, it seemed best to just book it.  </p><p>“That doesn’t seem likely,” Crea answered. “He’s bent on neutralizing the threat. Besides, he detests running away.” She gave me a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry, he can take care of himself.” She turned and I followed her gaze to watch the coming battle. </p><p>“Honestly I’m surprised,” Inquest spoke to the flames loudly. “I didn’t expect you’d be polite enough to wait till we had finished our conversation.”</p><p>A high pitched, childlike laughter echoed out from the cloud of flames before it quickly formed back into a duplicate of Jo. “Dealing with you one at a time suits me just fine,” she spoke calmly. </p><p>“Then let’s begin.” As soon as he finished speaking his horn exploded once again in brilliant white light. Several large projectiles of magic burst forth from the tip and flew straight at her. It was if I was watching some sci-fi, space movie with aliens shooting plasma weapons. He fired three more before the first even hit. </p><p>Not that it mattered, none of them actually hit. </p><p>The second before he opened fired, Jo had already leaped out of the way. Now, I say ‘leaped’ but it’s not exactly what you’d imagine. From the waist down her form changed back into this flaming vapor which seemed to let her slide away as if she was floating, which was fortunate for her. The projectiles, no bigger than baseballs, seemed to ignite rather than explode. The ground where they struck appeared to have singed, often leaving rocks glowing red hot. </p><p>This didn’t seem to surprise Inquest one bit, rather it seemed he expected it. He fired more in faster succession as he swerved his head to follow. For several intense seconds this exchanged continued on, Inquest firing relentlessly and Jo dodging every single one with incredible ease. </p><p>“Hmm,” Inquest hummed thoughtfully, ending his barrage. The tip of his horn smoking slightly from the discharge. </p><p>“Aw, done already?” Jo teased childishly, half her upper body still floating in midair. </p><p>“I’ve only gotten started,” Inquest replied with a smile of his own. “Try dodging this.” His horn blazed again as he fired even more projectiles, but these were miniscule compared to the ones before. </p><p>What they lacked in size, Inquest more than compensated for with sheer numbers. Like an automatic rifle, his horn fired a stream of magical missiles, hundreds were probably fired in a manner of seconds. In simple terms, he was going for a ‘spray and pray’ strategy. Despite how agile and elusive Jo was, there was no way she could evade them all. But evade them she did, in the most inconceivable way.</p><p>She disappeared. </p><p>There’s really no other way to explain it. One second she was there, about to meet Inquest’s new assault, and the next she was gone. There wasn’t even a sign of movement, not a blade of grass around her stirred. It was like some god just decided to pluck her from existence. </p><p>“Where’d she go?” I mumbled. I turned to Crea, whose eagle eyes danced about as she scanned the area for any trace of Jo.</p><p>“No,” she eventually answered. “Inquest!” she called in warning.</p><p>“I know,” he replied. His back was against me so I couldn’t see his face, but I could feel an air of intensity still radiating from him. “She’s still here.”</p><p>A heavy silence fell on us as we waited for something to happen. Crea took a step closer to me and placed her wing over me like a shield. Meanwhile Inquest stood his ground, his horn still ablaze. More than just power, I could ‘feel’ how sharp the magic in his horn was. This might sound a bit of an exaggeration, but in that moment I could compare Inquest to a samurai. His horn was a katana, holding magic at the ready just as a samurai would hold his sword. </p><p>“Is hiding all you can do!?” Inquest yelled, his patience wearing thin. </p><p>“It’s only natural to play with your toys,” I heard Jo reply, her voice echoing from every direction. “I tend to break them too fast when I’m not careful.”</p><p>The way she hid, the way her voice seem to reverberate from every direction; I had seen it just recently before. </p><p>“She’s under you!!” I screamed. It’s not that she disappeared, she simply reverted back to that shadowy form from when she first showed herself. The fact that it was night and the moon was hidden allowed her to blend perfectly with the dark environment. She even kept her distance so that the light from Inquest’s horn couldn’t reach her. </p><p>“Too late,” her voice echoed again. Black needles sprang up from the ground beneath Inquest, and I don’t mean needles doctors use; these rose a meter high. Some were as thick as coins. They were more like black spikes actually. A single one could easily kill any pony, human, or giant gryphon should they pierce. </p><p>I didn’t even get a chance to react before we saw Inquest get pierced. He practically turned into a pincushion in a split second. Hooves, shoulder, neck, body, even the head; all were repeatedly pierced through without remorse.  </p><p>“Well,” Jo spoke in a disappointed tone. “That was rather anticlimactic.”</p><p>“Dammit!” I may not have known him, but the fact that he came to save me and died meant that it was my fault. A deep rage built up inside me. I was ready to make Jo pay, magic or no magic. Luckily, before I could do anything rash or foolish, I felt Crea’s large talons on my shoulder holding me back.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to kill him,” I heard Crea spoke. Turning I was surprised to see a calm expression on her face, even the tiniest curve of a smile. “See anything strange?” I turned back, giving a second look and immediately realized what she was talking about.</p><p>There was no blood.</p><p>“Crea,” I heard the riddled body yell, “get back!”</p><p>“Could’ve warned us earlier!” Crea screamed just as she roughly grabbed me around the waist. Before I could do or say anything she pulled me off the ground and carried me who knows how far. </p><p>Not a second sooner did Inquest’s body, still with those black needles impaling him, start to glow bright white. It shone like the dawn of a new day before exploding into a column of fire. In that short amount of time Crea managed to carry me a good ten meters away, yet I could still feel the heat of the blast on my face. Only a smoking crater five meters wide was left where Inquest stood as all manner of earth rained down on us. </p><p>“Holy shit!!” I yelled in awe. </p><p>“A decoy,” a voice answered close by. Turning I saw Inquest somehow standing close by appearing perfectly fine. </p><p>“You could have mentioned you were planning on using that!” Crea yelled angrily. </p><p>“It was a spontaneous decision,” he replied with a nonchalant shrug. </p><p>“Wha-what just happened!?” I asked. “How are you-”</p><p>“When she disappeared it was obvious she’d attempt a sneak attack,” he explained. “I immediately replaced myself with a decoy and laid a spell inside it. Depending on the distance, I can even control it as if my own body.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Can he really weave a spell like that?’</span></p><p>“But how did you switch places with the decoy?” I asked. “How’d you move without me seeing?”</p><p>“I teleported,” he answered in a ‘isn’t it obvious’ tone. “With practice one can weave and cast spells without the glow.”</p><p>“Wait wait wait, you can teleport?” I spaced out for a second trying to wrap my head around the idea and implications. “Teleport? Like, moving from one place to another instantly?”</p><p>This time he turned and looked at me confused. “You’ve never seen Twilight teleport? Exactly what has she been teaching you?”</p><p>“Apparently she’s been holding the good stuff back,” I grumbled. </p><p>“Not that this is important or anything,” Crea cut in. “But maybe we should check if that thing is still alive.”</p><p>“Oh I’m alive.” Before either of us could respond, a single black spike shot up from the ground and pierced Inquest’s left forehoof. </p><p>“AAAAARGH!!”</p><p>If it had been me, I would have probably pulled my limb back which would in turn worsen the injury. But through the pain Inquest kept his focus. Rather than removing the spike from his body, he moved his body from the spike. In bright flashes of light Inquest’s whole body glowed before disappearing and reappearing almost instantly several feet away. Still, that might have been a mistake. With the spike missing I could see blood gushing out of his wound like a broken water bottle. If this keeps up, he’d soon die of blood loss.</p><p>“Inquest!” Crea reared back and was about to leap towards him but was immediately halted. </p><p>“No! Stay with him! Protect-AAAAGH!” As the previous spike evaporated like smoke, another rose from beneath Inquest again, this time piercing his right rear hoof. Jo had two perfect opportunities to kill Inquest if she had aimed for his heart or head, but the fact that she aimed for his limbs meant that she was toying with him. </p><p>“Go!” I yelled at Crea. “Help him!” I would of course have loved nothing more than to have a giant gryphon by my side protecting me. But I couldn’t watch somebody get tortured either. </p><p>“DON’T INTERFERE!!” Inquest bellowed through gritted teeth. His horn flashed again as a glowing, white, translucent disk materialized in the air above him. Inquest then teleported on top of it, balancing himself on his two uninjured limbs. </p><p>Seeing as the spikes were rising from the earth, Inquest choose to create a floating platform for which he could stay away. But the damage was done, the glowing white disk soon turned deep crimson as blood covered it. With his safety momentarily secured, Inquest immediately tended to his injuries. </p><p>“Inquest” Crea called out again, “here!” She grasped and pulled one of her pockets before throwing something up to him. </p><p>It glowed white as Inquest caught it in his magic. From inside various colored leaves floated out and were immediately squeezed in the air, turning into a deep dark green paste. He then quickly applied them to both hooves, where it did little to stem the flow of blood. To secure the leaves in place, two thin layers of glowing material grew out from Inquest’s horn which coiled around each wounded area. Inquest gritted his teeth in pain as the cloth-like material wrapped itself around his hooves. The impromptu bandages held the green paste in place while the pressure prevented any further excessive bleeding. </p><p>All the while we heard Jo’s childlike laughter and giggles echo all around us, as if she was enjoying the spectacle. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked, still hidden. “Done already?”</p><p>Surprisingly, Inquest replied with his own laugh. “I’ve suffered through worse than this.” His horn blazed brighter than ever before. “And I’ve dealt far worse!”</p><p>With that shout Inquest fired an uncountable amount of projectiles into the sky where they glittered momentarily like stars. Once they had reached a certain height, they curved back and rained down on the area. For several seconds, magic fell like hail all around us, burning and melting the earth where it struck. Though where these things landed were random, Inquest made an effort not to accidently hit either Crea or myself. A good meter around us was left undamaged. </p><p>Inquest had chosen to count on the law of probability, his impressive rain of magic was actually making progress for the first time since the battle started. Though I couldn’t hear any yelps or screams of pain, I would occasionally notice wisps of black smoke rise and evaporate where Inquest’s magic struck. But whether or not it was actually hurting Jo, I couldn’t tell. </p><p>Eventually the attack ended, leaving scorch marks and rocks glowing red hot all around us. While Crea was keeping her eyes peeled for signs of Jo, I was left speechless with my jaw hanging loose at what I witnessed. The sheer amount of magic it took to accomplish this could have drained every ounce of my own magic if I had tried the same. But what made it so hard for me to believe was the amount of control needed. The fact that none of them had hit us meant that Inquest would’ve had to control each spell individually so as to exclude a certain area. Even if they were simple spells, the amount of focus and effort required to cast so many so fast would’ve melted my brain.</p><p>Inquest did it while controlling a magical platform and suffering two punctured limbs. </p><p>“That hurt!!” </p><p>I winced in pain at the sudden high pitched yell. I felt the ground rumble slightly as thick black smoke sprang up from the ground around us. It quickly gathered into a dark cloud before turning back to bluish flames. Jo stepped out from inside the torrent of blue fire looking absolutely pissed.  </p><p>There were no signs of injuries on her that I could tell. She just stood there like she does but with a noticeable change in demeanor. I wasn't sure at first if Inquest’s attack actually managed to do anything to her. If not for her sudden outburst and expression you’d think she was unharmed. However, at times bits of pieces of her would, well, just fade out. Like a blurred photo or distorted image. To me, it looked as if she was having trouble keeping herself together, literally. </p><p>“Good!” Inquest yelled back with a satisfied smile. “Here’s a taste of something new!” The white glow on Inquest’s horn suddenly dimmed out, replaced by flashes of light as electricity sparked from and all over the tip. Think of a tesla coil and you’ll get the idea. </p><p>“Cover your ears!” Crea shouted. </p><p>It all happened in a split second. For just the briefest moment, I remembered seeing a white line arcing out from the tip of Inquest’s horn, zigzaging sharply as it traveled through the air towards Jo. For a long time I had trouble believing what I saw, but there was no denying it. </p><p>Inquest just shot lighting out of his horn. Actual, wrath of the gods, lighting. It came with everything; the flash of light, the smell of ozone, and of course, the thunder. Being struck by lighting can be bad and lethal for sure, but being close to one is no pleasant experience either. The thunder left my ears ringing and the impact of sound knocked the air clean out of my lungs. I could only imagine how much stronger real thunder from a real lightning strike would be.  </p><p>“What! The actual fuck!” I shouted, reaching far too late to cover my ears. There was no signs of Jo, a red glowing spot where she stood was all that was left.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So is she dead?’</span></p><p>“Is it over?” I asked aloud, my ears still ringing. Neither answered, Inquest busy eyeing the ground and ears twisting about. Unlike pony’s ear that can swivel like a radar dish, Crea needed to turn her head around for the same benefit; much like an owl.  </p><p>“There!” she suddenly shouted, a claw pointed towards a beachball sized boulder. Inquest and I instantly turned our heads to follow, and though it was difficult to see in the dark of night, we definitely spotted something moving. </p><p>Inquest somehow managed to focus the glow from his horn into a spotlight, though I’m not sure if it was an actual spell or just him molding the ambient light of his magic. In either case, he offered enough light for us to see what Crea was pointing at. Something small, dark, and long scurried away from us through the grasses. I only got a glimpse, the tall wild grass blocked much of it, but it moved in the same manner a snake would. </p><p>If I had been in his position, I would most likely have hesitated for a second or two, thinking it was a false alarm, but not Inquest. He acted without hesitation, trusting in Crea’s judgement. I suspect he didn’t even know what he saw, only that Crea pointed in that direction and something moved. </p><p>Now let me just remind everybody that at the time, I was still confused by everything. I didn’t know what was going on or how I fit into all of it. Not to mention all the crazy spells Inquest was throwing around. That said, here’s what I saw.  </p><p>Imagine two halves of a giant sphere materializing out of thin air roughly above where the snake was. It looked similar to the platform Inquest was laying on, glowing white and translucent. Like a crane, it dropped down to the earth and snapped shut, forming a perfect sphere with bits of earth trapped inside. It then rose back up into the air, carrying its contents where it hovered, a meter of the ground. </p><p>“And where….do you think you’re going?” Inquest spoke in a strained and exhausted tone. It seemed to me that despite his earlier performance, Inquest was was close to his limits. For a while there was nothing, no voice mysteriously speaking from every direction. “It’s no use pretending,” he gazed at the sphere with a confident smile, “I know you’re in there.”</p><p>Still nothing. </p><p>“Well then.” Despite the obvious mental strain on him, Inquest started firing many small projectiles at the sphere. </p><p>Obviously I was confused, why would he attack his own magical construct like that? But it immediately became clear when the first projectile came into contact with the sphere. Or rather, when it didn’t. </p><p>It went right through the wall, all the way to the other side of the sphere. That’s where things got pretty damn cool. Once inside the sphere, the projectiles started ricocheting seemingly infinitely all over the place. Only when striking the small patch of earth inside did it stop, leaving behind a smoldering char of mud, rock, and foliage. </p><p>With such a contained barrage, it really doesn’t matter where you go or what you become. It didn’t take long for us to notice a writhing black form, rising from the earth inside the sphere. At first my guess was correct, it looked like a black snake trying to stand on its tail. But the higher it climbed the less concentrated it became, eventually diffusing into a dark fog similar to that of a rain cloud. From within came a high pitched, blood chilling scream. The sphere started to vibrate as the clouds suddenly acting violent, pushing and slamming itself against the walls. </p><p>“Holy shit,” I mumbled, not quite believing it. “You caught her.”</p><p>“Let me go!!” she screamed, her high pitched voice stinging my ears. All of a sudden it converged together and turned into a large black bear. It started clawing at the walls which caused small sparks to fly out. When that didn’t seem to work it started bashing the walls with brute strength, sometimes causing the walls to bend dangerously out. I could tell all that struggling was actually making progress, the walls started to turn more transparent while Inquest tried his best to fuel the spell with more magic. </p><p>“Enough!” Inquest shouted, firing more projectiles into the sphere. The bear howled in pain before exploding back into black smoke, only to converge once again into a…</p><p>“What the hell!?” I nearly jumped back in surprise at the sudden monstrosity. It took me some time to recover from the initial shock before my brain kicked in. I’ve never seen a picture of it before, but I had read a description in one of Twilight’s books that matched perfectly.  </p><p>A manticore. Head and body of a lion, large bat wings on its back, a massive scorpion’s tail, and all kinds of ferocious.</p><p>With a roar that made my genitals shrink, it started going ballistic inside the sphere, clawing, beating, and stabbing with its tail against the walls. Again Inquest fired several shots into the sphere burning the creature where it struck, hoping to control it before the sphere collapsed. The manticore resisted at first, shrugging off the first few burns, but eventually it too was overpowered. It exploded again into black smoke, spinning and moving around inside the sphere, hoping to find some weak point. </p><p>This whole thing repeated several times, Inquest firing into the sphere while ‘not-Jo’ continued to resist with the ferocity of varying wild beasts, both normal and mythical. She even tried turning into an elephant hoping her sudden increase in size would break the sphere, which it nearly did. But another lightning strike directly into the creature stopped that.  </p><p>Finally things slowed down. The transformations came less often and the black smoke swirled about with less intensity. It was clear she was either weakened from her constant attempts to break free, or injured from Inquest’s assault. Likely both. In the end, the black smoke stopped moving altogether, settling on the bottom of the sphere like a calm fog. Finally it seemed this nightmare was coming to an end. </p><p>“Inquest,” Crea called worriedly.</p><p>“I’ll...I’ll be fine,” he replied in laboured breath. “Just need to...” </p><p>His horn glowed brighter and so too did the sphere. Slowly it started to shrink, removing most of the excess space. I suspect that doing so meant less wasted magic, though that’s only a speculation. Surprisingly, the smoke didn’t move or retaliate at this sudden change. Perhaps it was too weak to do anything. </p><p>“Rodney,” a feminine voice called from within the sphere. “Help me.”</p><p>I wasn't sure if I heard correctly at first. “Help?” Something in me stirred. “HELP!?” It wasn’t simple rage, but something much deeper and primal. My hands shook as I clenched them into fists, knuckles white. Though the pain from my fractured rib was still there, it felt deadened and distant. </p><p>“After what you’ve done!” I shouted. “Why the fuck should I help you!?”</p><p>“Quiet!” Inquest threatened. The sphere stopped shrinking as he fired several projectiles at the smoke, to which it recoiled away. As it settled down the color changed back to blue. Before Jo, hair still burning, appeared from within the flames. She was on all four, weak and hurt, slowly her hands pressed against the wall as she looked right at me with a pained expression.</p><p>I knew exactly what she was doing! Using Jo’s face to manipulate me, hoping to use my own emotions to help her. At this point I was well aware that this creature, despite her intimate knowledge of me, was not <i>my</i> Jo. Nothing more than a perversion of the real one. A fake. But still, seeing that beautiful face in such a tortured expression made my chest tight. Even with all my anger and resentment, there was a small part of me that wanted to save her.</p><p>“That’s enough,” I spoke out to Inquest, his eyes fell on me. “It’s over. You caught her. There’s no need for torture.” We locked eyes for a few seconds. He had likely guessed the reasons for my request. He let out a sigh, just as the glow on his horn dimmed a bit. With the battle over, the magical platform Inquest was on slowly descended down. It broke apart and disappeared as it touched the ground, causing Inquest to hop on two hooves before settling down. I grimaced at the sight of his wounds. It was covered with the green paste and the magical bandage was still on, but nearly every part of his limb was soaked with blood. </p><p>Crea immediately went to his side and offered herself as support. Exhausted and nearly spent, Inquest allowed himself to sink and rested against her. His focus and concentration, however, never wavered. The sphere prison still held strong. </p><p>“Crea,” Inquest started, “take the human back to town while I prepare this thing for transport.”</p><p>Crea glanced at the sphere and at the creature within hesitantly. “I can’t leave you alone with this...thing,” she argued. “Especially not with those injuries. They need to be looked after before-” </p><p>“The sooner I get the creature in my lab, the sooner I get medical attention.” He paused momentarily for some much needed breath. “I may be injured but I’ve got enough in me to get back to my lab. There I can fashion a more permanent containment for it. Should be easy enough now that I know magic is effective against it. You take the human to Twilight, then fly back to the castle.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘They want us to leave? Screw that! We need answers!!’</span> Usually I find myself in disagreement with the voice in my head, but not this time. This time we were in complete agreement. </p><p>“Now hold on!” I interrupted attracting both their attentions. “I’m not going anywhere until I get some answers.”</p><p>“This is not the time-” Inquest began, but I wouldn’t have it. I may have been submissive in the past, but not this time. No more waiting for answers just because it was inconvenient to someone, not when it seemed to involve someone I loved so dearly. </p><p>“How does she know so much about me!?” I asked aloud, more to the impersonator herself than to the two. “How could she know things only that I know!? What does she want from me!? And more importantly, why the hell does she look like that!?”</p><p>“I understand you’re confused.” Inquest tried to console. “But now is not-”</p><p>“Fuck your ‘I understand’ bullshit! You know shit about how I feel! You’re not the one who woke up on some fucked up world, dreamed up by a ten year old girl!!” I glared and pointed a finger at the impostor in the sphere. “You! I want answers and I want them NOW!!”</p><p>I felt Crea trying to restrain me. Couldn’t really blame her. It must have been plain to see that I was starting to lose control. I remembered coming <i>that</i> close to siphoning her dry, just so I would have something to focus all the pent up emotion that had been piling up. But the fact the fact that these two came and risked their lives in order to save mine. That knowledge was all that refrained me from using my syphoning powers on them. </p><p>I heard the impostor laugh which stopped my struggles as I turned my attention to the sphere. “Oh, Rodney,” she said in a husky whisper, “I know everything about you.”</p><p>Crea’s hold was too strong for me to pry off, I could only lean my head towards the sphere, paying no mind to my body’s protests. “What do you want from me?” I demanded. </p><p>She laughed before suddenly giving me a strange look. “Tell me, am I the enemy?” </p><p>I paused. “What?”</p><p>My confusion made her laugh again. “Come now, you’re smart. Don’t you think it’s strange that you're still alive? Why bother dragging you out here? If I wanted to kill you, I would've done it much sooner. Think about it.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘She….has a point.’</span></p><p>“Then why didn’t you?” I pressed on. </p><p>“Well now, isn’t that the question?” she teased. </p><p>“Aargh!” I screamed, frustrated by her cryptic words. “Give me a straight answer dammit!!”</p><p>“Enough of this,” Inquest interrupted. “Crea! Now!”</p><p>I could feel Crea’s talons press down tighter, but I didn’t care; not even when they drew blood. I’ve yet to get the answers I wanted. I dug my feet into the ground and fought as much as I could against Crea’s pull, but it was futile. Her superior strength easily overpowered my resistance and soon I felt myself being lifted and placed over her muscular shoulders. </p><p>“I’m not your enemy Rodney!” she screamed as I was forcefully carried away. I noticed the sphere’s luminance brightening as Inquest too started to glow. Jo’s expression turned to panic, yet her smile remained. “You'll see soon enough!” </p><p>I tried shaking and wiggling out of Crea’s grip, but in the end all I could do was watch as Inquest and the sphere shrank away in the distance. The last thing I saw was Jo’s face, still smiling confidently at me before being swallowed up by bright light. Inquest’s own body matched in brightness, and soon both he and Jo seemingly blinked out of existence. </p><p>Her lasts words echoing in my mind.</p><p>“I have the answers you need!”</p>

							<header><h1>Author's Notes:</h1></header>
<p>Oh my goodness this was a hard one!</p><p>Not that the action scenes was difficult to write or anything, I mean it was rather intimidating but I've tackled bigger. Rather, I kept second guessing myself in almost every plot progression; 'Is this the way I want the story to fold out?&quot; What happens in this chapter will set the tone for a good portion of the story, so I had to get it right. </p><p>I know the word count for this chapter is around 9K, but I'm pretty sure I've written at roughly three times that. There were about 4 different scenarios on how this chapter panned out. One, Rodney falls under Jo's control and battles Inquest and Crea. Two, Rodney becomes unshackled. Three, in the battle the &quot;limit&quot; placed on him was removed. </p><p>But in the end I decided with the way it is; Rodney sitting on the sideline and giving the fighting role to Inquest and Crea. Shows a bit more of how capable the two are as individuals and as a team. More importantly I think this chapter showed how human Rodney is, that he is not perfect. </p><p>I know it's not much, but I really hope you all enjoyed this chapter. I put a lot of effort and heart into it. But hey, if there is something that bugs you then by all means tell me. Just please explain why, it will help me become a better writer. </p><p>Till the next chapter, which hopefully comes WAY faster than this one. <br/>~ Zai</p><p>P.S Also I totally understand if you've forgotten what happened in the story, considering how long it's been. Besides, adds more views on the previous chapters. <img alt=":trollestia:" class="emoticon" src="https://static.fimfiction.net/images/emoticons/trollestia.png"/></p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 42 - All so easy<br/>Edited by AndyGrey<br/>Pre-read by AndyGrey</p><p>[AN: Better late than never right?]	 </p><hr/><p>The walls of the tree shook as the door violently flew open. I could hear something small clatter across the floor; one of the hinges probably broke. Crea’s grip on me tighten as she slid to a stop, her talons scraping the floor leaving long gashes. </p><p>I expected Twilight to wake up in surprise and barrel down the stairs to check the disturbance. Only, she was still awake. She was standing near the far window looking at us wide eyed with her jaw hanging loose. Before she could say anything I was dropped, rather roughly, onto the nearest furniture. Fortunately I landed on my other side which was fine, otherwise my fractured rib might have broken all the way. </p><p>“No time to explain everything,” Crea said with tired breath. “Danger’s gone! Inquest is at the castle! Need to go check on him!” And with that she turned and bolted out the door, just as fast as she came, leaving Twilight barely able to process the whole thing. </p><p>“Oh!” Crea yelled just outside the door. “Send a few to check the hospital. They’re all unconscious but unharmed!” With nothing left to say, she spread her massive wings and did a short run before launching herself, disappearing into the night sky. </p><p>Silence followed, both Twilight and I were unsure what to say or do next. It was during this short reprieve that I finally noticed that Twilight wasn’t the only pony in the room. Spread around the main area of the library were five large white bubbles, floating above the floor. Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Pinkie, and Dash were curled up inside. The sight of them reminded me of those quarter capsule toys outside of the toy shop I visited as a kid. </p><p>Finally, Twilight broke the silence with the most expected question. “Rodney, what happened?” she asked, galloping towards me. </p><p>I realized then, that while Crea has been carrying me around like a sack, the hospital gown I wore had twisted around my body, covering my side while leaving my back and front open for display. I should probably count myself lucky it was the dead of night, otherwise my naked butt would have been paraded through town for all to see. I quickly aligned the gown to cover myself and repositioned to a more comfortable sitting posture.  </p><p>Twilight looked at me and waited for a reply but I didn’t give any. Honestly, after what happened, I was both mentally and physically drained to a point where I just didn’t care. Not even when the five closest ponies I knew were sleeping inside bubbles hovering above the floor. </p><p>Well, almost.</p><p>“Are they ok?” I asked in a tired tone, gesturing towards the bubbles. </p><p>“Yes they’re just fine; they’re asleep,” Twilight quickly replied. “The Professor came by and- Look they’re safe, that’s the important thing. Now what happened?” </p><p>I let out a long tired sigh. “I saw a ghost,” I mumbled randomly. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>My eyes drifted towards Rarity who, despite being curled up and pressed together, still had her perfectly manicured appearance. “Twilight,” I called, “I need you to go to the boutique.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>I looked at her. “Sweetie Belle’s all alone.” For a second she just looked at me before slapping herself with a hoof for not thinking of that. </p><p>“Ok, I’ll take everypony back home and then you’ll explain what’s going on.” </p><p>Again I didn’t reply, didn’t make a sound as I just laid there in a state of ‘I don’t give-a-damn’. Seeing my impassive expression must've finally made her realize that I just wanted to be left alone. Instead of waiting, she just turned and trotted next to Rarity, her horn glowing. </p><p>“Check the hospital,” I added, reminding her of what Crea said earlier. </p><p>“I’ll wake the mayor; she’ll round up a group to go.” Twilight’s horn glowed brighter as she gathered magic, her trademark purple aura spreading and covering all five bubbles that held her friends. As soon as they were all enveloped, Twilight and everybody disappeared and a flash of purple light. </p><p>“Huh,” I mumbled to myself, “she really can teleport.” My body started to sag as I just let go of everything, my head resting back while I stared at the ceiling. “Dammit, that would’ve been useful.” I made a note to ask Twilight the details later. </p><p>Surprisingly, I didn’t immediately fall asleep as I had expected to. I just laid there with my thoughts wondering about. First, Jo or whatever that thing was, the fight with Inquest, the spells he casted, and finally why I deserved to suffer like this. </p><p>“You still there?” I asked the empty room.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Unfortunately.’</span></p><p>“You’re being rather quiet, nothing to say about all this?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘A lot actually. But luckily for you, I’m too busy holding us together. I’m the only reason you haven’t lost it all already.’</span></p><p>“Wait, so my symptom of insanity is...keeping me from going crazy? That doesn’t-”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Make any sense? Kinda agree with you there. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure how I’m doing it. But trust me on this, that Jo-thing traumatized you more than you know.’</span></p><p>With Jo being brought to the discussion, I naturally started thinking of over what happened, questioning why she suddenly showed out of nowhere, where’d she come from, what she wanted with me, and of course, what she meant at the end. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><i>“One day you’ll find out who the liars are! And when you do! Come find me!!”</i></p></div><p>Just remembering those words made me question everything. Liars? Who? What kind of lie could be so horrific that I’d be willing seek her out? I can’t imagine anyone from Ponyville being involved, haven’t really been here that long. But Twilight? She had been there from the beginning. I had spent more time with her than any other pony. She didn’t seem like the person, or pony I suppose, who would betray me like that. </p><p>Unless….</p><p>“Celestia.” </p><p>It was difficult to believe Twilight could hide something, but if it was for Celestia, that wouldn’t be too farfetched. She adored Celestia too much to say no. </p><p>“Goddammit!” I yelled, rubbing my face in frustration. This was all purely conjecture from baseless paranoia; a bunch of guesswork and maybes that may or may not be true. There’s no way for me to know for sure about anything. Not yet anyways. </p><p>I stopped thinking for a moment, calmly breathing in, and out hoping to think more clearly. Jo was the enemy, that much was clear. I had no reason to believe anything she said. But at the same time, why didn’t she just kill me when she clearly had more than ample opportunities to do so. If her objective wasn’t to kill me, what was it? </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><i>“Come find me!!”</i></p></div><p>“Why the hell would I ever want-” I froze as a thought struck my mind. “Oh god, a way home?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Alright just stop right there!’</span> I felt an odd sensation, like a tap to the brain. <span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘What’s the point in speculating?’</span></p><p>“I...” </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Which is more likely; that somebody out there is hiding an earth shattering secret? Or that Jo’s just messing with us? We have no reason to trust her!’</span></p><p>Was it purely wishful thinking? That I desperately wanted to go home that badly that I’d dream up some wild situation, just so that I can believe that maybe it was still possible to go home?</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You’re not in the right state of mind, trust me, I am actually in your head! Just get some rest. That’s the best you can do right now. Or just find something else to do.’</span></p><p>I let out a sigh and tried closing my eyes, but sleep was difficult, maybe there was still a bit of adrenaline flowing in my veins. Whatever the reason, my eyes started to wander about the library, trailing along the walls of the living wooden structure and rows of books. There were plenty of novels, romance, mystery, and a surprising amount of adventures. There was even a collection based on a pony called Daring Do. </p><p>Eventually, I spotted what looked like the academic section. Nestled in their own corner were books of knowledge, encyclopedias, and guides about the world, the elements, and of course, magic. A few I recognized. I had read them myself from front to cover as part of Twilight’s training regimen. She had insisted that I needed more knowledge than practical skills. </p><p>Considering recent events, I found myself seriously questioning that wisdom. </p><p>“Magnet, maglev, levitation, propulsion, shield,” I mumbled in thought. There were a few more, but these were the spells I had grown accustomed to, and relied upon the most.</p><p>That had to change. I needed more. More magic, more spells, more ways to fight against whatever this world had in store for me. It was time to get real. </p><p>Even with exhaustion and the pulsating pain of my fractured rib, I reached out with a hand towards the bookshelf. I randomly choose a book which was enveloped by blue flames. It slid out of the tight fitting and floated to my hand. </p><p>“Book Three: The Art and Craft of Runes,” I read the title aloud. Of course, I had no idea what runes were, and I doubted it had anything to do with the kind of runes you find in fantasy video games and the like. “Whatever,” I mumbled. With the book balanced atop my chest, I flipped to the first page…</p><p>...and fell asleep before I even finished the first paragraph. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/fc4f65524ee8f0e669e022dbffe351a04413b594?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fbj84mkv.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[Credit to Holly for the new art.]</p></div><hr/><p>“How is he?” the regal alicorn asked, her tone heavy with concern. She trotted on down the quiet hallway, deserted except for the occasional sentry. </p><p>“We don’t know,” the pegasus replied, eyes still glued to the initial reports held by her wings. “But based on those who saw him, the injury appears to be extensive.”</p><p>“Of all the foolish...,” Celestia started before stopping herself with a sigh. “Is his life in jeopardy?”</p><p>“Possibly,” the pegasus, wearing a doctor’s coat, answered. “Reports suggest he’s bleeding heavily. One of the staff noted two of his hooves were bound by magic with some sort green paste. I’m guessing he tried to dress his wounds in the field.” She suddenly dropped the reports in frustration. “But none of this matter if we can’t even get to him! He’s-”</p><p>“Locked himself in, I know,” Celestia finished. </p><p>She had only been informed of the situation moments ago, that Inquest had suddenly teleported in the main laboratories. He immediately ordered all the staff on duty to leave. Worse, he then activate the emergency containment system, a series of enchantments placed on every door and window for emergency purposes. Or in most cases, when one of his experiments ran amok. It was Inquest’s own design, both formidable and complex, which only a few key individuals, aside from himself, were given authority to activate and release. </p><p>But it would appear as though Inquest had tampered with the locking spell in some way. Shining Armor, one of those individuals with the authority had failed to lift the enchantments. The only other option would be to break the enchantments and spells apart one by one. That, however, would take a team of skilled unicorns at least a day or two to accomplish. It was a difficult and tedious tasks, like pulling apart a massive tapestry thread by thread. What troubled Celestia the most however, were the reports given from the staff who witnessed Inquest’s appearance. </p><p>He had brought something along with him, encased in a giant white sphere of pure magic. From the description, Celestia immediately recognized it as a containment spell of sorts Inquest had created, often used to deal with dangerous materials in large quantities. Celestia’s hooves trotted faster as she pondered what could be inside. Only one guess stood out amongst the rest. </p><p>The other ‘visitor’.</p><p><i>‘Has he done it?’</i> she thought. <i>‘Actually tracked it and captured it? How? Did they fight? Who started it?’</i> Celestia quickly shook such thoughts away, fussing over them now would do nopony any good. For the moment she needed to focus on gaining access to the research wing and making sure Inquest didn’t kill himself. </p><p>Both Celestia and the doctor trotted on in silence as they made their way outside. The research wing was located as a separate building directly east and next to the castle walls, connected with a skybridge for ease of access. The cold night wind greeted Celestia as she stepped onto the bridge, which offered her an excellent view of the castle grounds. </p><p>Most nights, the gardens were peaceful and beautiful to behold. Small luminescent gems were placed along the ground, glowing with a soft light. Only the occasional guards on their patrol would ruin the serene scene.</p><p>But this night was anything but peaceful. There was a large group of ponies milling about the research building, either curious, worried, or both. The look of concern on all their faces was understandable. The building - and tower that stood above it - had always been full of magical activity. The massive amount of magic inside made the building glow and you could always hear ponies working inside and around no matter the time. But now it stood dark and foreboding. Lifeless. The only indication that somepony was inside were the occasional sounds of clatter, metal clanging and glass breaking, as if a manticore was rampaging inside. </p><p>“Princess!” called a familiar voice. Celestia turned her attention forward where she saw Captain Shining Armor trotting urgently towards her. </p><p>“Captain,” Celestia greeted, “what’s the situation?” </p><p>“We’re still locked out,” he answered, moving to trot next to her. “A group of the research staff are currently at work trying to break the enchantment on the door, but it’s progressing slowly. I’ve ordered my guards to begin carving right though the walls, with luck it might be faster.”</p><p>“You still couldn't undo the lock?” Celestia asked to affirm. </p><p>“No, Your Highness,” he answered. “Whatever’s going on inside, The Professor clearly wish to be left alone.” </p><p>“I’ll not have him bleed to death in there. What of Crea?” Celestia had hoped to question her, thinking she might shed some light to the situation.</p><p>“No signs of the griffon ma’am. I do have guards watching the sky; we’ll know when she arrives.”</p><p>“Princess, if you will,” the doctor spoke, “I’d like to get my own team ready.” She turned to the captain. “Sir, I’d like a gurney and a few ponies brought close to the door so we may immediately administer emergency treat-” </p><p>“Do it,” he cut in. With a respectful bow to Celestia the doctor immediately departed, leaving the two alone. </p><p>“Captain, I would also like the area cleared.” Celestia gazed down at the gathered ponies below. “One of The Professor’s experiments could escape in all this commotion. I do not wish to see another rampaging carpet, or any other furniture, harm anypony.”</p><p>Shining Armor turned his attention towards a single pegasus, a night sentry, that hovered just outside. “Sergeant!” he called out. “I want crowd control! Clear the grounds!”</p><p>The sergeant gave Shining a salute before gliding down towards the crowd, his squad following behind. Hovering above the crowd, they started ushering the ponies away in an orderly fashion. By the time Celestia had had crossed the bridge, the building was already isolated with spectators standing a good distance away and the guards standing in between, keeping the perimeter.</p><p>As Celestia stepped off the skybridge unto the building, she saw a group of unicorns standing in front of large double doors. Unlike the ones from the throne room, which were intricately decorated with gems and gold, the doors leading to the research wing were plain and simple. They looked like ordinary polished wood often found in many common homes, the only difference being the size. A pair of brilliant diamonds embedded on each door were the only decoration. Many considered such a dull statement unworthy. Afterall, it was the entryway to where the most gifted ponies worked to further the advancement and understanding of magic. A place where the most complicated, dangerous, and ambitious spells were created. </p><p>But the choice for it’s appearance was not due to sloth or budgetary reasons, rather out of necessity. At a far closer inspection, one would discover that what looked like wooden grooves on the surface, were in fact thousands of extremely minute runes. These magically strengthened the door’s durability and strength many times beyond its physical limit. The diamonds provide the needed supply of magic. Moreover, for both security and to ensure that the supply of magic remained full at all times, The Professor made it mandatory that a unicorn had to be present to open the doors, for it would only allow entry when an appropriate amount of magic has been ‘offered’. </p><p>These doors were Inquest’s first product after he took the title of The Professor. Each took three months to create, a marvel of runecraft, spellweave, and enchantment. </p><p>“Progress?” Captain Shining asked loudly. Though they had heard them, none of the unicorns even glanced their way as they approached, engrossed with the unbelievably difficult task of dismantling the enchantments on the doors. </p><p>A pegasus, and a member of the night guard, stepped forth from the side. “Excruciatingly slow,” he answered. </p><p>“Steadfast!” the Captain called in pleasant surprise. </p><p>“Captain,” he greeted with a salute before bowing to Celestia. “Princess.” It was easy to tell the gesture was painful, the bandages visible under his armor were a dead giveaway that he hadn’t fully recovered. </p><p>“Heard you took some dragonfire to the face,” Shining spoke humorously. </p><p>“Wasn’t to the face, sir,” Steadfast answered.</p><p>“Are you fit for duty, lieutenant?” Celestia asked in a caring tone. </p><p>“Fit and able, Your Highness.”</p><p>“Is that the doctor’s opinion, or yours?” Shining asked with a knowing look. Steadfast only smiled. </p><p>“Lieutenant,” Celestia continued,“had I known a dragon would attack Ponyville, I would not have sent you and your squad so poorly prepared as I did.”</p><p>Steadfast gave another bow. “Part of the job Your Highness.” Though Celestia expressed her regret in her inability to foresee such danger, she held herself from apologizing. To do so for sending them into danger would be a disrespect to their commitment. </p><p>Celestia turned her attention to the looming doors. “How long?”</p><p>Steadfast sighed. “With the way things are going, three days. Maybe four.”</p><p><i>‘Too long,’</i> Celestia thought. </p><p>“Things outside aren’t going so well either,” Steadfast continued. “They just brought in some heavy duty tools but it’s hardly making a scratch. Looks like the enchantments on the building are just as tough as the door’s.”</p><p>“Well, it was designed stand against every assault imaginable,” Shining added. “I suppose this shows we’ve done a good job.”</p><p>Celestia moved past the line of unicorns and stood right in front of the entryway. Right in between the doors was a small circular cut for a keyhorn, a locking mechanism that would only open for certain individuals; the same kind that guarded the Elements of Harmony. Obviously, only a unicorn or alicorn would be capable of unlocking such doors. </p><p>Celestia dipped her head and pushed her horn through the slot. She felt the tingling sensation as magic touched and prodded her horn. One second later, she heard the familiar sound of grinding gears as the locking mechanisms started moving. However, it didn’t take long before she heard a sudden clamp on the gears, straining and grinding as if something had been unhinged. </p><p>Celestia sighed as she pulled her horn out. <i>‘He must’ve burned one of the runes controlling the locks,’</i> Celestia deduced. <i>‘I’ll have to do this the hard way.’</i></p><p>“Captain, please-”</p><p><b>“Sister!”</b> a loud familiar booming voice shouted accompanied by a burst of deep blue light as Luna appeared, appearing especially irked. <b>“Who is this that dares-”</b></p><p>“Luna,” Celestia interrupted in a calm voice, “inside voice.”</p><p>“Oh, ahem, pardon us. Now, what has that arrogant pony done this time?” Luna asked, keeping her voice in check. </p><p>“I’d like to know that as well,” Celestia replied. “It would seem we would need to ask Inquest himself.” Celestia stared intently at the large doors. </p><p>Following her gaze, Luna immediately understood. “I see.” Without another word, she moved and stood next to Celestia. Both their horns started to glow, which quickly grew to near blinding light. </p><p>“Captain,” Celestia called in a warning tone. </p><p>“Everypony get back!” Shining ordered. “Unicorns! Erect a barrier and try to contain the damage!” With trained diligence each guard reacted perfectly, those unneeded moved out of the way while the unicorns stood in a line. Their horns burst into life as a shimmering, multicolored wall of light grew in front of them, trapping both Celestia and Luna in an enclosed space. </p><p>Celestia frowned as she stared at the doors. “He won’t be pleased with us destroying one of his accomplishments.”</p><p>“All his fault for forcing our hooves,” Luna replied unwaveringly. </p><p>“I suppose. Ready?” Celestia asked. </p><p>Luna smiled. “Always.” The radiance around their horns exploded ever more brilliantly, Celestia’s golden hue of dawn while Luna’s a dark blue from the night sky. Their clashing lights mixed beautifully together, like the twilight from dawn and dusk. </p><p>As Luna and Celestia were about to unleash their combined destruction, they both heard a multitude of gears turning. The doors began to slowly open moving only inches every few seconds. It made a loud creaking noise that made everypony’s back tingle with anticipation. , the added creaking noise of wood only seem heighten the anticipation. </p><p>They heard Inquest’s raspy breathing before his hoof came to view, and both alicorns silently gasped at the sight. It was worse than Celestia had expected. Inquest came out limping, more dragging than trotting, as he could only balance himself on two hooves, a long stretch of blood trailing behind. </p><p>For a while everypony was silent, too shocked to do anything but stare at the grisly sight. It didn’t seem as though Inquest even noticed them. His head was hanging low as he continue to limp past the door. It didn’t take long for his strength and will to fail. He collapsed on his side, the squelching noise he made indicative of how drenched his fur was in blood. </p><p>“Out of the way!!” somepony screamed from behind. Everybody turned to see a group of ponies, all dressed in white coats rush to the scene with a gurney. The line of unicorns quickly separated as each jumped to the side, the wall of light evaporating into nothingness just in time as the doctor’s charged past. </p><p>Celestia quickly reacted and levitated Inquest up, his body glowing in soft golden light. Once the gurney was placed under, Celestia gently lowered him onto it, as if placing a newborn in a crib. With the missions Celestia had sent him on in the past, Inquest was no stranger to wounds and injuries, a few even life threatening. But it never made it easier for her to see him like this, or anypony for that matter. </p><p>“Get a patch of Tyllos, a bottle of Suntouch, and as many packs of his blood type to the emergency room! Now!” a doctor shouted, the same pegasus that accompanied Celestia moments ago. An earth mare nurse quickly turned and galloped down the hallway as fast as she could. </p><p>“How does he fare?” Luna asked worriedly. </p><p>“Worse than I expected,” she replied, scrutinizing Inquest’s injured hooves as she pulled away some of the green paste with her wings. “But not beyond hope,” she quickly added. “Time’s of the essence, he’s lost too much blood.” The doctor gave Celestia a look. “Your Highness.”</p><p>Not wasting time on words Celestia’s horn immediately glowed, the golden light spread to the doctors, Inquest, and the gurney. But just as Celestia was about to teleport them all to the medical wing, she heard a gravelly voice. </p><p>“Nopony goes...inside,” Inquest wheezed, his eyes looking straight at Celestia’s. Inquest was by no means young, some would even call him elderly, despite his youthful vigor. But at that moment Inquest seemed to have aged centuries, appearing ancient and withered. “It...lies. Don’t….don’t believe...” With his last remaining strength used up, Inquest’s eyes fell shut. </p><p>Fearing the worst, Celestia unconsciously cried, “Inquest!!”</p><p>“Princess, now!” the doctor shouted. With that Celestia’s horn exploded into light, gathering more magic than was needed as they all vanished in blinding light. Silence followed after, everypony unsure what to do as Celestia stared at the floor with worry. </p><p>“I’ve...never seen him like that,” Shining spoke, breaking the silence. “I mean after all he’s done, feels like he’s indestructible. I didn’t think-”</p><p>“Captain!” Luna interrupted. “We wish for guards to be placed on duty at all times! Full measure! Nothing, living or otherwise, leaves or enters without our sayso!”</p><p>Shining Armor’s hoof shot up in salute reflexively. “Yes Your Highness!” He turned and glared at the rest of the guards in the hallway. “Well you heard her!” he barked. “I want three pegasi teams patrolling the skies at all times! Earth ponies stand at perimeter and unicorns on spellwatch! Magic or otherwise, nopony will touch this building, am I understood!?”</p><p>A resounding “Yes sir!” echoed throughout the hallway. Captain Shining Armor’s voice receded as he trotted out unto the skybridge, shouting further orders to everypony outside. </p><p>“Sister?” Luna called worriedly. </p><p>“I’m fine, Luna,” Celestia replied. “I just didn’t expect to see him so...” Her focus shifted to the large double doors in front of her, now open. “I want to see what has caused all this,” she spoke, full of determination. </p><p>“Is that wise?” Luna argued. “We know nothing of what lies within.” Unfortunately the open entryway did not offer any vision of the laboratory. A short hallway that split into a T shape lead to the main area, a measure of security preventing anypony from catching glimpses. It also helped traffic, one path for entry and the other for exiting. </p><p>Celestia stared down the open hallway in silence, swaying between caution and curiosity. It would be a simple matter to just wait for Inquest to wake and question him then. But with the degree to which he suffered, it would probably take a day or two before he regains consciousness. </p><p>“Just a peek,” Celestia finally decided, trotting cautiously inside. </p><p>“I shall remain close, sister,” Luna said, following suit.</p><p>As Celestia trotted down the hallway and turned the corner, she was greeted with darkness. The glowing gems that decorated the walls were gone. In fact, looking at the damage, it seemed as if they were torn right off their sockets, leaving scarring depression along the walls. With the light of her horn illuminating the way, Celestia continued forth and finally reached the main laboratory. </p><p>Or what was left of it. </p><p>“Inquest,” Celestia gasped under her breath, “what have you done?”</p><p>Rubble everywhere, wrecked pieces of metal and wiring were strewn about the floor. Machinery several times a pony’s height, costing thousands of bits and uncountable hours of research to build lay in torn ruins. Various prototypes, the first of their kind, that could accomplish wonders in various fields, were now nothing more than junk, their guts torn out. </p><p>Most perplexing were the experiments - pantry dishes, testing equipment, chemical compounds, cultivated rare medicinal plants - all piled up to the side like discarded garbage. Ongoing research that Inquest himself had started and protected obsessively as if they were his offspring. </p><p>The title of Professor had given Inquest some power, but that position did not not make him omnipotent to the law. Every property, even those Inquest created himself, belonged to the government and had been funded by the nobles and populace. Once all this came to light, many would protest against Inquest’s continued position as The Professor. He would not face any severe punishment, but at the very least he would be dishonourably discharged; the first to taint the esteemed reputation of that title. Pride had always been Inquest’s weak point, a humiliation such as this would be the kind that could break him. </p><p>“Has that old pony finally lost it?” Luna spoke in bewilderment, glancing about every corner of the laboratory. Her eyes suddenly fixed upon something at the far side. “What is that?”</p><p>Following Luna’s gaze, Celestia spotted a source of light in the distance. It was rather surprising how she failed to notice it before, after all, it was the only other source of light besides their horns. The sight of the butchered lab disturbed her more than she thought. </p><p>Without a word, Celestia started making her way towards the light, her hooves stepping in between scraps of metal and shattered glass. Whatever gave of the light was massive, though the brightness was dull and soft. As she trotted closer, Celestia soon realized what it was she was gazing at. </p><p>A giant sphere of light, probably the same one the staff reported earlier when Inquest first appeared. It would have required a massive amount of magic to create something like this, but what was most impressive, was how condensed and refined it was. Such magical constructs tended to leak magic, and would gradually deteriorate with time before completely breaking down. To condense the magical structure so tightly would mean minimal deterioration, ensuring a long lifespan. </p><p>The sphere was encased in a metal frame, hastily bent and fused together with heat. It held the sphere in a tight grip, preventing any possible movement or rotation. Furthermore, Celestia spotted wires of varying size trailing down the frame like plant vines. Following them, she soon understood the reason behind the laboratory’s destruction.</p><p>Gems. All of them, from large arcane gems to the miniscule battery gems plucked from the wall. They lay in a pile away from the sphere, each and every single one of them were coiled with wires connecting to the metal frame. </p><p>“Stars save me,” Luna spoke aloud, standing over another similar pile of gems. “He butchered everything in order to collect the gems that power them.” She looked back at the sphere. “All to strengthen this. Why?”</p><p>“Because he deemed whatever is inside worth sacrificing all this-” Celestia mouth froze as she suddenly heard something. </p><p>Crying. Weak and barely noticeable, it was the unmistakable sound of a filly’s cry. </p><p>“Mommy?” the voice called out fearfully. “Mommy where are you?” A soft shadow appeared from inside the sphere, hugging against the wall. Based on its form and size it definitely belonged to a small filly, likely only a few years beyond infancy. </p><p>“Don’t let the mean pony get me,” she cried, choking against sobs. </p><p>Celestia felt her heart pulled towards the filly. To the public, she was, a source of inspiration and authority. Those that had known her closely would have understood that all her motivation, strength, and will, originated from a single but powerful source. </p><p>A motherly devotion. They may not be directly connected, or even of the same species, but Celestia saw all ponies as her children. To see and hear a filly so frightened and alone reached deep to the very core of who she was. Without realizing it, Celestia’s horn had already ignited with magic, ready to break the sphere. </p><p><b>“Celestia!”</b> Luna shouted, her royal voice shaking the walls, making dust rain from the ceiling. The light of Celestia’s horn immediately died down and she blinked several times, as if waking up from a dream. </p><p>“Luna,” Celestia called softly, eyes closed. “Thank you. I...” Celestia’s expression turned to confusion as she too was surprised by her near mistake. With her wealth of experience as an immortal, she believed herself to always be in control no matter the situation. To have her emotions overwhelm her so easily, even for a fraction of a second, was disturbing. </p><p>“I think it best that we leave,” Luna suggested. “Mad as he is, I do not believe Inquest is capable of such cruelty. Neither is he prone to grievous mistakes of this scale.” Lune paused for a moment for her words to sink in. “Let us have faith in our mad subject.”</p><p>“Yes, you’re right.” Celestia gazed at the shadow inside in silence, the cries and sobs thrumming her heart. “Inquest, if anything, would never harm an innocent.” </p><p>With a deep breath Celestia turned and trotted away, Luna following soon after. Both made the effort to not glance back, even as the cries seem to grow louder and more heartwrenching. Though it affected Celestia more, Luna too had a hard time ignoring the filly’s cry for help. Luna had a special place for the young, their innocence was something she cherished deeply.</p><p>“No, mommy, don’t leave me! I don’t want to be alone! I’ll be good, promise!”</p><p>Both alicorns trotted out the laboratory, past the entryway and sealed the doors once again. Turning the whole building into a temporary tomb. </p><p>As their magical light faded from the room, the small filly slowly ceased it’s crying. It shimmered for a few moments, only to dissolve back into shadow while it laughed in a childish voice. </p><p>“All so easy.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 43 - If you do that with a pie...<br/>Edited by Andy Grey<br/>Pre-read by Andy Grey</p><hr/><p>“Still nothing?” Twilight asked after sipping her tea. </p><p>“I’m afraid not dear,” Rarity answered. “He’s surprisingly stubborn.” A few cubes of sugar floated from the small table and fell into Rarity’s cup. The two mares were seated across from each other at the Ponyville Café. “In fact I’m starting to feel rather guilty for prying. He clearly does not wish to talk about it.”</p><p>“Everypony in the hospital mysteriously fell unconscious,” Twilight argued. “Just because nopony was hurt doesn’t mean we should ignore the whole thing. Rodney’s the only one who knows what happened.”</p><p>“Well what about The Professor?” Rarity asked, she frowned after mentioning him. “Honestly, I feel betrayed. I expected more from a pony of his stature and reputation.” Rarity emptied her cup. “Putting a lady to sleep like that,” she added. “The nerve of him.” </p><p>“Well, I have sent a letter to the princess.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“She hasn’t replied yet,” Twilight answered. “So, again, Rodney’s the only one who knows what-”</p><p>“Madam, your orders,” a yellowish earth pony called as he arrived at their table. “A dandelion sandwich for you,” he offered the dish to Twilight, “and fresh salad with persimmon shaves for you,” he placed the last dish in front of Rarity in a practiced manner. </p><p>“Thank you Savoir,” Rarity replied. “Oh, this does look appetizing.” </p><p>“I’ll be sure to relay the compliment to the chef,” he replied before trotting on towards other customers. </p><p>Both mares took a moment to enjoy their dish before Twilight spoke again. “How is he though? Everything okay? I know it’s only been a week since he moved back in.”</p><p>“Not bad,” Rarity answered. “He can’t work just yet, so he spends most of his time in his room.” She looked at Twilight thoughtfully for a second. “Well, you should know, he drops by the library nearly every day now doesn’t he?” </p><p>“He has,” Twilight answered. “And that’s been bugging me for a while now.” Twilight took a bite of her sandwich before proceeding. “In the past he’s been an exceptional student,” Twilight’s expression suddenly became irritated, “when he’s not messing about. But now he has this amazing, almost starving drive to learn more.”</p><p>“I certainly hope that it won’t impede his recovery,” Rarity commented. </p><p>“It does. Which is why I refused to teach or train him until he recovers completely.” Twilight let out a sigh. “But he won’t listen. Earlier he tried attempting something on his own.”</p><p>“What? Like learning spells on his own?”</p><p>“Exactly. He just took a bunch of books, skimmed them, and tried whatever seemed to interest him.” </p><p>“That doesn’t sound so bad. Even I tend to try out new spells on occasions,” replied Rarity. </p><p>Twilight gave Rarity a serious look. “And what if he tried to teleport and failed?” Rarity grimaced at the thought. “Or maybe he discovers the principles of energy conversion and forgets to protect himself; he could burn from the inside out. Or, maybe-”</p><p>“Alright alright,” Rarity interrupted, not wanting to imagine the human in those horrific circumstances. “You’ve made your point. But still, Rodney’s not a fool dear. He wouldn’t attempt something so dangerous without proper guidance. He might be reckless and act foalish but he’s smart enough to ask for help.”</p><p>“Of course he’s intelligent, very much so even. But are you willing to leave it to chance? Magic is completely foreign to him! What if he fails to identify a danger in a spell? Remember, he’s not from-” Twilight leaned forward spoke in a quieter voice. “He’s not exactly from around here.”</p><p>“I suppose you’re right, dear,” Rarity agreed. “So then what did you do?”</p><p>“From then on, I realized that completely forbidding him from learning would only result in greater danger; for himself and possibly those around him. So, I agreed to continue teaching him if he would promise not to attempt anything magical on his own without my consent.”</p><p>Rarity gave Twilight a rather surprised look. “And he agreed to that?” </p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Rarity thought for a moment. “Hmm, I’d say he agreed.”</p><p>“He did,” Twilight replied, though in a way that suggested there was something more.</p><p>“But,” Rarity added, “knowing him, he would still do things on his own. He’ll keep to his word regarding <i>new</i> spells things you’ll teach. But-”</p><p>“But he won’t stop training by himself or experimenting on the spells he’s familiar with,” Twilight finished.</p><p>“Precisely,” Rarity replied, slightly surprised Twilight managed to speak her thoughts perfectly.</p><p>Both mares looked at each other for a moment. They started to giggle, which turned to full laughter seconds later. “Isn’t it wierd how easily we can predict his behavior?” Twilight asked as she giggled. </p><p>“It is,” Rarity agreed between laughs. </p><p>“Maybe because we’re so similar in behaviour? Sometime I wonder how his behaviour can be so pony-like.”</p><p>“He does, but it’s still rare for anypony to be read so obviously. Maybe because he thinks and acts too much like a foal?” Both mares couldn’t help but giggle and laugh some more. They weren’t insulting the human in any way. In fact, they didn’t quite understand why the notion was so hilarious. It just was. </p><p>Twilight sighed after the mirth ebbed away. “And let’s not forget he can create his own spells as well. It’s not perfect plan, studying magic always carries an inherent amount of risk and danger, but it’s better than nothing.”</p><p>A thought then came to Rarity. “Twilight, how did Princess Celestia teach you?”</p><p>“Oh,” a wide smile spread across Twilight’s face. “Well, during my first day she-”</p><p>“I meant,” Rarity interrupted, fearing the lavender mare would reminisce for hours to come. “How did she stop you from making those mistakes? And don’t tell me you weren’t like him back then; I know you Twilight Sparkle. In fact, I can imagine you being worst.”</p><p>Twilight smiled sheepishly. “That obvious?” Rarity smiled and gave her a nod. “The Princess once told me that, ‘the lessons that are ingrained are those learned by both mind and body’. I didn’t know what she meant at first until I tried doing something that was beyond me.” Twilight frowned at the memory. “I was hoping to impress the Princess with a new spell, instead I got hit with a massive backlash of magic. I was bedridden with a migraine for two days straight.”</p><p>“Oh you poor dear,” Rarity consoled. “I...had my own experience,” said Rarity with some hesitation. “In my early years I tried turning a dress I made in the very last minute a different color. The spell worked, mind you, just not on the dress.”</p><p>Twilight smiled slightly as she tried to suppress her suspicions. “Your coat?” Rarity nodded embarrassingly. “What color?”</p><p>“....Colors.”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“Colors, not color.” Rarity looked away. “I was green with polka dots of varying colors.”</p><p>For a split second, Twilight imagined Rarity with that description which caused her to giggle uncontrollably, despite trying her best to not laugh at her friend’s expense. </p><p>“I’m fine with Rodney practicing his magic at night,” Rarity continued, moving the discussion along. “I just hope he doesn’t blow up my home.” Remembering that both mares had yet to finish their lunch, they resumed eating, their eyes wandering to view the town and the coming and goings of ponies around them. </p><p>It’d been close to a month now since the dragon attack ruined Ponyville. The rubble and large debris were all gone, discarded or otherwise reused to rebuild and fix things. Several areas of the town still couldn’t get running water, the pipes under the street had yet to be fixed completely, as was indicated by the large cracks found over many streets. </p><p>Had anypony said that it’d only take a month for most of the town to be fixed, nopony would have believed. Not that reconstruction was slow, magic had always made even the toughest and largest tasks highly manageable. Rather, it was the time needed to prepare and plan the effort, contacting companies and ponies, organizing logistics and flow of supplies needed. If this was any regular incident, it would have taken Ponyville roughly three times as long to reach this point. Perhaps the fact that a dragon was responsible for the attack helped push everything along. No doubt The Princesses involvement also made the situation even more unique. </p><p>So, even though the effort was not complete, life in Ponyville had returned to normal. The ponies that were forced to camp at Sweet Apple Acres after losing their homes had left. Not all of them had returned to their homes, but many who did offered temporary boarding to those who need it. Enough so that nopony needed to sleep outside anymore. </p><p>Applejack had earned awards for being the most dependable pony, several times now. But there was no doubt that every member of the Apple family would be honored in some way. Already ponies were dropping by, either bearing gifts or offering their time to help with whatever needed. </p><p>But the Apple family were not the only ones who have earned the town’s appreciation. </p><p>“Excuse me.” A somewhat elderly unicorn approached the table. </p><p>“Clear Cut,” Rarity greeted, recognizing the old unicorn. “Twilight, this is Clear Cut. He’s a very gifted gem cutter.”</p><p>“How do you do?” Twilight greeted. To Twilight, he certainly appeared elderly. He stood with some sag in his posture, and his horn seemed to have lost its luster over the years. Perhaps the most distinguished feature was his beard, deep crimson, and unusually long. </p><p>“Well and unharmed,” he replied before he gazed away with a frown. “Thanks to your human I suppose.”</p><p>“Rodney is not <i>my</i> human,” Twilight corrected. </p><p>“Yes, of course,” he apologized, mentally scolding himself for that mistake. A box wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine appeared out of the saddlebag he wore. “I was hoping to drop this by your shop, Rarity, though I found it empty and thought to return tomorrow. But luckily I spotted you on the way back.”</p><p>“I don’t remember placing an order,” Rarity replied, gazing at the box. </p><p>“A gift, for the hu-for Rodney,” Clear Cut quickly corrected. “It is my thanks for saving the town and, I suppose, saving me as well. My shop is all I have.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure he gets it. I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.” The glow around the box changed to a shade of blue as Rarity took it with her own levitation spell. </p><p>“And this,” Clear Cut continued, levitating an envelope from his bag, “is my apology to him.” Both Rarity and Twilight gave the envelope an odd and curious glance. “It was a long time ago, in fact I doubt he would even remember. He came by my shop with one of your orders, Rarity. Anyways my….greeting to him was less than courteous. Actually it was down right insulting.” He glanced away shamefully. “I’ll be honest, wasn’t quite sure what to think when he first came to town. Him and that strange blue fire of his.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>[AN: Happened in Chapter 18.]</p></div><p>“I’ll make sure he gets it,” Rarity repeated. </p><p>“Well then, I suppose that’s it. Looking forward to your next order,” he gave a nod to Rarity. “It was nice meeting you, Twilight. Come by my shop, The Perfect Cut, if you ever need professionally crafted gems or jewelry.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you too, Clear Cut, though your work might be wasted on me. I’ve only used gems for magic and such.”</p><p>Clear Cut gave her a shrug. “Ah, you never know.” With that, he turned and left, trotting down the street and disappearing behind the many ponies going about their business. </p><p>“Well that was nice of him.” Rarity gave the envelope a look. “Sometimes I forget that Rodney actually fought a dragon. He really doesn’t behave like somepony who is capable of such a thing. It’s a bit surreal.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t believe it either if I hadn't seen him charging headlong towards the dragon,” said Twilight. </p><p>Rarity once again gazed at the ponies around them. “I think everypony won’t mind having him around now. Protector of Ponyville,” Rarity added jokingly, raising her hooves in the air in exaggeration. </p><p>“I just wish he didn’t have to fight a dragon to achieve that,” Twilight added. </p><p>“Are you saying that nopony would accept him otherwise?” Rarity countered. “You make it sound as if he <i>had</i> to risk his life for the town to accept him completely.”</p><p>“Of course not, everypony would have loved Rodney if they were willing to get to know him. There are plenty of ponies who already did, even before the dragon attack. He might like to tease and mess around, but he’s not hateful, and can be very attentive to ponies’ feelings. He’s funny, in his own weird way, and there’s rarely a dull moment around him.” Twilight smiled. “I think the best part is that he thinks differently.” </p><p>Rarity was caught surprised. She hadn’t really meant anything with that question, she just threw it out to keep the conversation going. It made her think.</p><p>“Speaking of Rodney,” Rarity started. “Is he still in the library?”</p><p>Twilight nodded. “I gave him some books to read, he’s not quite ready for the more advance spells yet. Spike and Shine Bright are keeping him company, I told them to make sure Rodney doesn’t try anything reckless. I already moved the more ‘dangerous’ books away, just in case Rodney tries to sneak a peek.”</p><p>Rarity hummed for a while, thinking as she stared at Twilight who had yet to finish her meal. “Twilight,” she called again. </p><p>“Hmm?” she replied, eating the last bit of her sandwich. </p><p>“Are you sure it’s okay? Leaving those two alone?”</p><p>“Of course,” Twilight answered. “The Princess herself sent her to help me keep an eye on Rodney. So far Shine seems capable of handling him.”</p><p>“That’s not exactly what I’m worried about.”</p><p>“Then what is?” Twilight asked innocently. </p><p>Rarity didn’t immediately answer. Academically Twilight was brilliant, there was no arguing that. But it was also clear to Rarity that Twilight lacked any real experience or aptitude for social matters. It had gotten better, of course. Rarity had seen Twilight grow as a friend and pony ever since that fateful day. But there was still one aspect that worried her. One that Rarity believed every pony, especially a lady, should experience in her younger years. In this criteria, Rarity had the superior knowledge and expertise in this compared to Twilight. </p><p><i>‘Subtle, or blunt?’</i> Rarity pondered. </p><p>“Aren’t you worried how they’re spending so much time together?” Rarity asked, attempting the subtle approach.</p><p>“Why should I? It’ll be best if they do. If Shine can learn to better handle and watch over Rodney, giving me more time researching his unique magic. In fact, I have a new theory that explains why his magic acts so violently.” </p><p>Most of what Twilight had just said flew past Rarity. It was clear to her that subtlety wouldn’t work. Twilight simply lacked the experience and knowledge to understand her hidden meanings. </p><p><i>‘Being blunt won’t work either,’</i> she deduced. Knowing Twilight, she would only withdraw from a forced confrontation. Should Rarity outright ask her suspicions, Twilight would only deny it.</p><p>Rarity would have to tread carefully. After all, it did involved two of her friends. If done too haphazardly or hastily, it could end their friendship. Rarity decided then that she needed to prepare, ensure there really was a chance. </p><p><i>‘Rodney first then.’</i></p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Golden Oak Library]=========</p></div><p>“Spike, are there any runes in the library?” I walked around the main area, trying to find anything similar to what the book in my hand described. </p><p>“Well of course there are,” Spike answered, though he still kept his attention on the comic he was reading. Yeah that’s right, they got comics. “There’s a few in the kitchen.”</p><p>“What kind of rune is it?” I began making my way there.</p><p>“Mostly wards,” he answered, before glancing away from his comic and giving me a look. “Remember the fire?”</p><p>“Ah,” I murmured sheepishly. “Yeah I’ll make sure not to touch anything.” </p><p>“Is that why you keep insisting that I take the books from the shelves?” Shine asked, a brow raised. </p><p>“Yep,” Spike answered for me. “Can’t risk him accidently touching the walls or anything. Messes with the runes. Don’t ask why cause I don’t know. Twilight never told me.”</p><p>“Then why is he inside?”</p><p>“Because I got these,” I quickly answered, raising a leg and pointing at my feet. “Shoes. I’m not actually touching anything right now. It’s all about skin contact,” I clarified. </p><p>I continued to make my way to the kitchen, chains jingling with each step, when Shine asked another question. “In that case, why can’t you just wear mittens?”</p><p>“Mittens? Cause then I...hmmm.” I was about to argue that, with mittens I wouldn’t be as dexterous with my hands as I wanted. But Shine’s question did inspire another idea, one that made me question my intelligence.</p><p><i>‘Why hadn’t I considered wearing gloves? Pretty sure Rarity could easily make me some.’</i></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You really think I know how the flow and creation of ideas work in the human mind?’</span></p><p>“Uhm, Rodney?” Shine called, her head tilted in confusion. </p><p>“Huh? Oh, no mittens wouldn’t work,” I finally answered. “Won’t be able to use my hands properly.” I wiggled my finger fluidly like worms for emphasis. “But gloves would.” </p><p>“What are gloves?” she asked.</p><p>That question stumped me for a second, although, after giving it some thought it sorta made sense. These ponies after all wouldn’t have any use for gloves. in fact, I think a horseshoe or a sock would be the better comparison. </p><p>“It’s like a fabric formed to fit comfortably around my hand. Designed to form without restricting movement.” I lifted a leg again, letting them see the white fabric showing on my ankle. “Like socks, just thinner.” I decided to leave the fact that leather tended to be used as the material for such things. I doubted these ponies would appreciate the fact that humans were wearing the flesh of animals. Hell, they’d probably freak out. </p><p>After making a mental note to ask Rarity for a pair of gloves - <i>‘Remind me to ask Rarity for a pair of gloves.’</i> - I finally made my way to the kitchen. Much as I looked though, I couldn’t find anything rune-ish anywhere.</p><p>“Spike, I can’t find any,” I yelled. Using a wooden spatula, I carefully propped one of the cabinets open, thinking there might be a rune on that wall inside. </p><p>“Chirp!”</p><p>“I found Peewee, though!” I added. </p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>I stared at the baby phoenix while it played in a bowl of oatmeal. “Nesting on your oatmeals apparently.”</p><p>I could feel Spike sigh irritably through the wall. “Yeah, he does that when you leave a bowl of oatmeals lying around.”</p><p>“Oh, sorry,” I heard Shine apologize. “I was saving that for later.”</p><p>I turned my attention back at Peewee just as he rustled the oatmeals about before nesting comfortably. Now I have no knowledge of Phoenix behaviour at all, so I can’t say for sure if I’m right in this; but I swear there is something wrong with this bird. He’s just an oddball. He would disappear randomly only to reappear, sometimes a day later, in the most random of places. Neither Spike or Twilight seemed to know how Peewee manages to get to the places he’s been. </p><p>I’m starting to suspect Peewee is blood related to Pinkie.</p><p>“You are one freaky bird, you know that?” I mumbled at him. </p><p>“Chirp!” was all he said before his eyes closed. With a shrug I just close the cabinet door and left him there to sleep on Shine’s oatmeal. </p><p>“So where are the runes Spike?” I asked again. </p><p>“Behind the fridge!” he yelled back. </p><p>“Shine could you-” I was about to ask, a finger pointed at the fridge. </p><p>“I’m on my way,” Shine replied. Already I could hear her hoofsteps approaching. I stepped back, giving Shine her space as she, with her pony physique, easily pulled and pushed the fridge to rotate away from the wall. “There they are,” said Shine, giving me room to look. </p><p>“Whoa.” Sure enough, I got a clear view of the runes, though it was far more complicated than I had expected.</p><p>Where a normal fridge would probably have a few coils and a cable sticking out of the back, the back of this fridge - and likely every fridge - had nothing. It was completely flat, which basically meant that the fridge was nothing more than a box with a door. There was, however, an immense number of lines, all connected in some way. I had to double check the book I had with me; it was difficult to separate each rune from one another. </p><p>“Uh, Shine? I don’t suppose you know how all this works do you?” I asked, pointing at the runes. </p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t read runes.” she answered.  </p><p>I sat down on the floor, legs crossed with the book in the middle, while my chains clattered on the floor. Flipping over the pages, I tried to understand the design and functionality of the runes, but they remained elusive. It probably didn’t help that I hadn't read the book properly, and had only just skimmed most of it. </p><p>“There’s definitely more to it than just keeping things cold,” I mumbled to myself, the gears in my brain turning. </p><p>“Twilight once said to read from the beginning!” Spike yelled. “Like a sentence!”</p><p>“Thank you!” I yelled back, grateful for the hint. “Uh, where exactly is the beginning?”</p><p>“From the battery!”</p><p>“That makes sense,” I mumbled. With my ‘Sight’ it was easy to determine where the battery was, all I had to do was look for the bundle of fire attached to the fridge. “Oh hello,” I said out of surprise. </p><p>“What?” Shine asked. </p><p>I didn’t answer as my attention was too preoccupied with what my ‘Sight’ showed me. Yes, finding the battery gem was very easy - it was on the inside of the fridge, at the opposite side - but what held my attention were the runes. Or to be more accurate, the magic that flowed through them. </p><p>“Now that is <i>very</i> interesting,” I mumbled to myself.  </p><p>“What is?” Shine asked again, but again I hardly noticed. </p><p>To me, it looked as if the magic from the battery gem was flowing through the lines that made up the rune. Like a tiny pipes. But that was not all. Upon closer inspection, the magic was also being shifted and molded around as it traveled on. It looked exactly like how I would weave magic into a spell, or how magic is weaved in general. Reading about it helped me understand <i>how</i> runes work, somewhat, at least, but seeing it drove the idea of runes home. </p><p>The simplest way I can describe it would be: runes are like circuit boards. </p><p>Now I might be a programmer, but I only know the basics of how my computer - or any computer - actually functions in the physical sense. I’m a software guy, not hardware. But based on my understanding so far, runes are like manufactured spells. Let magic pour through and it’ll keep weaving a spell and let it go at the end. Which is pretty much the same as casting the spell.  </p><p>Now, that’s not to say that runes rival actual spells in strength. According to the book, if you duplicated a spell with runes it would only yield roughly twenty to twenty-five percent strength, when compared to that of its counterpart. Which is why runes were mostly used for simple functions, light sources, heating, and in this case, keeping the inside of the fridge cold. </p><p>In this world, magic had almost completely replaced electricity. Except that magic far outscaled electricity in terms of usability, availability, and in ease of access; magic is practically all around us. </p><p>I don’t know how long I sat there, open book atop my legs, just staring at the back of the fridge. I would’ve stayed there longer, if Shine hadn't snapped me out of it by shaking my shoulder. </p><p>“Rodney,” she called, practically right at my ear. </p><p>“Hmm, yeah, sorry Shine.” I cleared my throat. “Lost myself in thought there.”</p><p>“You also forgot to close your mouth,” she replied, glancing down. Following her gaze I looked down at the book which had a dark wet mark in the middle of the page.</p><p>“Did I seriously drool?” I asked, just as much to myself. I quickly grabbed my shirt and placed atop the page, hoping it would absorb the liquid before damaging it.</p><p>“Are runes really that interesting?” Shine asked curiously. </p><p>I smiled and looked at her with beaming eyes. “Very.”</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes up,” I heard a familiar voice say. When we turned around, Shine and I saw Twilight standing by the entryway to the kitchen. </p><p>“Twilight,” I greeted with a smile. “When did you get back?” I started pressing my shirt down harder on the book. </p><p>“Just arrived,” she answered. “You didn’t hear me come in?” I shook my head.</p><p>“He sort of drifted away staring at your fridge,” Shine explained. </p><p>Twilight smiled as she gave me a look. “Yeah, he tends to do that.” She trotted inside and stood next to me. “You haven’t touched anything, have you?”</p><p>“Nope,” I answered confidently. “Kept my magic level in check, same as before.” She gave an approving nod, before her eyes drifted to the fridge and to the book in my lap. </p><p>“Interested in runes now?” she asked despite the obvious answer. </p><p>“Twilight, why do you keep hiding things from me?” I asked, exaggerating my irritation a bit. “First teleportation, and now this?”</p><p>“I’m not hiding them from you, I’m <i>restricting</i> them,” she corrected. “For teleportation, you’re not ready for the challenge yet. That spell is beyond your skills right now, you’ll only hurt yourself.” Her horn glowed as the fridge moved back to it’s original position. “As to why I never introduced you to runes, there are several reasons.”</p><p>“Which are?” I asked, arms folded to show my irritation. </p><p>“Well firstly, you can weave spells.” I raised a brow confusedly. “Aside from tools and machines, there are very few reasons why a unicorn would want to study runes. Runes are mainly used to spread the use of magic to those who can’t weave spells. In fact, many nations around the world trade with Equestria for machines and designs involving runes.”</p><p>I turned and looked at Shine. “Is that true?”</p><p>“It is. Runes make life a bit easier for both earth ponies like me and pegasi. I mostly live in the castle, though, so I only have a few things that actually have runes back home. My favorite is the sink. It has this little box underneath that cleans dishes for you.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Does she mean a dishwasher?’</span></p><p><i>‘Probably.’</i></p><p>I contemplated this new information for a moment. “So basically, you guys trade in magic services?”</p><p>“That’s one way to put it,” Twilight answered, she sat on the floor next to me. “we manufacture and design runes based on demand, as well as supplying the battery gems needed to power them. We mostly trade for resources that Equestria, geographically, does not posses. So again, aside for the sake of trading, unicorns have little use for runes.” </p><p>I went silent again, still seated on the kitchen floor as I pondered everything Twilight had said. Mainly the part about runes being of little use to those that could weave spells. I still found that hard to believe. Perhaps it was because I see and think things from a different perspective. </p><p>“How many races are there that can weave spells like you and I?”</p><p>“If you consider total number of races there are, very few. Technically every race uses magic in one way or another; most do it naturally like breathing. There are even those who have managed to take advantage of magic elsewhere. For example the Zebras, being expert herbalists, have knowledge and uses for plants both naturally and magically. They’re the leading expert in herbal medicine and cultivators of exotic flora.”</p><p>“Don’t forget dragons!” Spike shouted.  </p><p>“Yes, dragons too,” Twilight added, mainly just so Spike could hear her. “Although there’s very little information regarding dragon magic. Dragons that have fled their homeland, like the ones here in Equestria, have lived in seclusion and tend to keep to themselves.”</p><p>For a moment my mind wandered back to the memory of my encounter with Falnor. The way his flames could chase down targets like homing missiles, or how he could heal himself in minutes. Yeah, dragons were definitely more than capable of magic. </p><p>My hands unconsciously clenched at the memory. </p><p>“And gryphons? Do they use magic?” I asked, moving the discussion along. </p><p>“They do. At some level they use magic for flight, the way pegasi do, but unlike them, gryphons are unable to control the weather in any way. They’re actually Equestria’s largest buyer of runic machinery, with it they managed to control the weather to a certain degree. Though they never did like the idea of having to also trade battery gems from us.”</p><p>“Yeah, I bet they don’t. Not only do you guys have a monopoly on making and supplying runes, but you also monopolize the battery they run on.” I chuckled. “Not sure if I should criticize or applaud you guys on that. You’ve created a market for products that would only work with the help of unicorns.” </p><p>Surprisingly, Twilight looked proud. “For your information, we ponies have always been excellent traders.”</p><p>I let her have that and I closed the book. “I don’t know Twilight, I would still like to give runes a go.”</p><p>Twilight’s gaze drifted down as she considered it. “Learning runes is a costly, mainly because of the supplies needed to make them, and extremely time consuming. Unicorns that trade in runes spend years honing their craft. I can read runes rather easily, but by no means does that mean I’m an expert at making them. I may not even be qualified to teach it.”</p><p>I sighed at that. “So learning runes isn’t an option?”</p><p>“Well I won’t stop you, and you’re certainly welcome to read about them.”</p><p>I raised a brow, surprised. “Really? What happened to restricting and making sure I don’t blow myself up?” I asked jokingly.</p><p>“Runes aren’t all that dangerous, you would have to try hurting yourself for it to be dangerous. Still interested in learning?”</p><p>I gave another thought. “Yep.” </p><p>Twilight’s horn immediately glowed. “Then you’ll need these to get started.” A second later three thick books suddenly materialized in front of her, landing on the floor with a thud. </p><p>“Okay, now you’re just showing of,” I said irritably. Twilight just smiled before disappearing in a flash of purple light, only to reappear a few feet away, in the main area of the library. “Annoying!” I yelled. </p><p>“Here,” Shine offered, moving to stand next to me. </p><p>“Thanks.” Careful not to touch the floor, I placed a hand on Shine’s back and used her to pull myself back up. All my injuries had pretty much healed, and only that one rib was still giving me issues. </p><p>Once I got back to my feet, I made my way back to the reading area where Spike and Twilight were, the books Twilight brought burning blue as they hovered behind me. The light from outside the window had a tinge of orange, indicating that the sun was starting to set. </p><p>“I guess that’s it for today,” I announced. “I’ll be back tomorrow Twilight.”</p><p>“Remember your promise,” she reminded in a stern tone. “Don’t-”</p><p>“I won’t,” I interrupted. “Especially seeing as I’m living in somepony’s house.” </p><p>“Ha!” Twilight suddenly yelled, catching my by surprise. </p><p>Looking back, I saw she had a hoof pointed at me with a look of victory. “What?” I asked dumbstruck. </p><p>She smiled smugly. “You said ‘somepony’.”</p><p>I thought for a moment. “Huh, I guess I did. I suppose that happens when you hear the word in almost every conversation.” I then figured out why Twilight reacted the way she did. “You would consider that a victory for ponies over my kind?” I asked with a smile. </p><p>“I’ll take my victories where I can,” she replied proudly. </p><p>I chuckled. “Fine, you can have that. But be warned,” I raised a hand and pointed at Twilight while striking dramatic pose, “counting victories means you and I are at war Twilight Sparkle! Do you dare challenge me? The Champion of Humanity!”</p><p>Twilight just smiled as she rolled her eyes at me. “Go home, Rodney. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>I smiled back and returned to normal mode. “See ya, Twi.”</p><p>“I’ll trot you home,” Shine offered, following me to the door. </p><p>“No thanks,” I said appreciatively. “I think I can find my way to the boutique without destroying something. You could open the door for me, though.” Shine moved towards the door and I followed, tired but still excited to start reading once I got back. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘The letter.’</span> </p><p>I stopped and sighed. <i>‘Right.’</i> </p><p>I reached into my pocket and pulled out a folded paper and stared at it hesitantly. Today had been a good day. It reminded me of my days back in the castle. Back then, I would spend all day studying and learning magic with Twilight. No dangers, no worries, and no dragons or shapeshifting horrors to torture me. Wouldn’t mind Blueblood's company either. </p><p>As much as I would like to, I could not afford to ignore what happened. To be in the dark for too long could be very dangerous. As things go my life at the moment isn’t all that bad. But at the same time, I couldn’t ignore her words.  </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><i>“One day you’ll find out who the liars are!”</i></p></div><p>“Spike,” I called, turning around. “Can you send this to Celestia for me?” I walked towards him and offered him the paper. </p><p>“Sure,” he replied casually. </p><p>“Rodney,” Twilight called in a long warning tone. Like a mother who just caught her child about to do something nefarious. </p><p>“Don’t worry Twilight,” I quickly replied. “It’s not a prank like last time, honest. It’s just a letter. Paper and ink only. No magic.”</p><p>Her suspicious gaze lingered for a moment before disappearing. “Well, ok then.”</p><p>I turned back to Spike. “Spike, if you would.” With the letter between his claws, Spike drew a deep breath and blew a stream of green fire. The letter instantly turned to ash before being carried out the window on a non existent wind. </p><p>“Done,” he spoke casually, before he went back to reading his comic. He would make an excellent geek.</p><p>“Thanks,” I replied, my gaze following the ashes as it flew away. I smiled mischievously. “If you do that with a pie, will it-”</p><p>“Rodney!”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Canterlot Castle]=========</p></div><p>“You’ve crossed the line, Inquest,” Celestia warned. Her tone was cool and calm, masking her displeasure. </p><p>“I’ve crossed many lines in the past,” the old unicorn replied, not losing his ground. “Most for the sake of the mission you’ve given me.” Despite his condition, weak and injured, his eyes never wavered under the glare of both alicorns. </p><p>“Do we look to be in a gaming mood!?” Luna yelled angrily. “You acted beyond your station and authority!”</p><p>“I’ve captured an enemy!” Inquest defiantly yelled back, unflinching. “In all honestly I am surprised,” he continued in a calmer tone. “There was something out there, one that sent a dragon to attack Ponyville, and you want me to do nothing?” His gaze turned to Celestia. “What happened to ‘protecting my little ponies’?”</p><p>“Inquest, I have tolerated your behaviour because I consider you more a friend than my advisor.” The room went dim as the sunlight from the window suddenly waned. “But don’t you ever question me like that again.” Despite her keeping her calm tone, Inquest felt a sudden pit inside himself, which forced him to remind himself who he was talking to. </p><p>“I apologize Princess,” he spoke solemnly. “I spoke out of place. Yet I still stand by my actions. What I did, I did for the sake of Equestria.”</p><p>Celestia sighed. “And never would I question your loyalty. It is your judgment that we are losing faith in. Crea has told us what happened, and of your actions.”</p><p>“No doubt she’s told you that my suspicions of the ‘visitor’ was correct,” he added. </p><p>“True, she has,” Luna confirmed. “This Jo, a shapeshifter with aptitude for exceptional manipulation of the mind. If what both of you claim is true-” </p><p>“It is,” Inquest bravely interrupted. “I am not some senile old pony with delusions of reality.”</p><p>“Certainly not,” replied Celestia. “But your actions, forcing the elements into a spell induced sleep? By law, you would have woken up in prison. You even involved the human.”</p><p>“I was thinking clearly.” Inquest winced in pain as he accidently moved his injured hoof. “I had the foresight to prepare should I fail in apprehending the ‘visitor’. Or worse, if I were to fallen under the creature’s control. The elements would have been safe with Twilight, as I left her with a plan. She would have brought them to Canterlot, where they would be under your protection and ready to be called upon, should you need their aid.” Inquest drew a deep breath to calm himself before his emotions run rampant again. “As for the human, he was apparently the target all along. I’ll admit, that was a miscalculation on my part. But his involvement was inevitable.”</p><p>“All the more reason to announce your intent,” Luna argued. “Entering a battlefield against an unknown enemy, we thought thee wiser than this. Thou should have called for aid.”</p><p>“Enough!” Celestia yelled, silencing the two. “This argument is going nowhere. What is done is done.” Her expression turned kind as she gazed at him. “I know you did what you thought needed to be done. We will not question that again. However, it is also clear that you’ve stepped beyond your authority. Especially regarding the research wing.”</p><p>Inquest, for the first time since they started talking, gazed away in shame and regret. “It was...necessary. I needed to ensure that <i>thing</i> would not escape. Too dangerous.”</p><p>Celestia sighed. “Nevertheless, you will be punished for this. The nobles would not stand by silently once they hear what has happened to their investments.”</p><p>“The nobles can go buck themselves!” Inquest cursed. </p><p>“Inquest,” Celestia called in a motherly tone. “You know you don’t mean that. After all, aren’t you yourself a born noble?”</p><p>Inquest grumbled irritably. “Don’t remind me.” That made the alicorns smile in humor. “So, what now?”</p><p>“Now you rest,” Luna answered. “Despite our displeasure, you have still done your part. The creature still resides in the lab, and your prison remains strong. We shall handle the situation from now on.” Luna turned her attention to the door. “You may enter,” she called loudly. </p><p>The door opened to reveal Crea. She had to lower her head to enter while squeezing her body through the doorway. The room immediately felt much smaller once she stood inside. </p><p>“Your Highness,” Crea greeted the alicorns. </p><p>“Crea, please ensure that Inquest gets his rest.” Crea gave Celestia a respectful nod before both alicorns made their way out the room. Celestia stopped just after the entryway and looked back at the gryphon with a smile. “By any means necessary.” </p><p>Inquest felt his guts squirm nervously. “I hate you,” he mumbled under his breath, just enough for Celestia to hear. </p><p>“No you don’t,” she replied mischievously before closing the door. </p><p>“They are certainly a strange pair,” Luna commented as they walked down the hallway. Except for a pair of sentries on guard outside of Inquest’s room, the floor was clear of ponies. “So, what to do about this ‘visitor’. We need to act quickly before the situation becomes more complicated.” Luna thought for a moment. “I don’t suppose we could just <i>eliminate</i> the threat, could we?”</p><p>Celestia sighed. “Luna, you must abandon that archaic way of thinking. How many times must I remind you that-”</p><p>“Yes yes, we know,” Luna interrupted with a frown. “Tis a different age. Then what would you suggest we do?”</p><p>Celestia remained quiet for a moment. “Truth be told, the fact that this new ‘visitor’ wanted Rodney troubles me greatly. If possible, I’d like to know its motive.”</p><p>“You wish to interrogate it?” Luna asked, though it was more of a statement. “How? We could fall under its manipulations if we are not careful.”</p><p>“I believe that should be our first focus regarding this matter,” Celestia answered. “A way to protect ourselves from its control.”</p><p>Both alicorns trotted down the hallway silently in thought until a trail of ashes flew towards them, catching their attention. </p><p>“It appears that your apprentice also continues to seek answers,” Luna added. </p><p>“So it appears,” Celestia replied. The ashes formed in front of them, materializing into a single piece of folded paper, not the scroll that Celestia and Luna expected. “It does not appear to be from Twilight,” Celestia deduced, noting the lack of name or insignia. </p><p>“Rodney then?” Luna guessed. </p><p>For a split second both alicorns remembered the last message the human had sent, and quickly took several steps away from the parchment. </p><p>“You open it,” Celestia offered, the folded letter floating towards the dark alicorn. </p><p>“Clearly it is meant for you, dear sister,” Luna argued. “It would be inappropriate.” The glow around the letter changed from gold to dark blue as it hovered back and forth between alicorns; each pushing it away from themselves with their magic. </p><p>The most powerful beings in Equestria, each an embodiment of a celestial body, leaders of their nation, afraid of a piece of paper, sent from a human. A pity there was none to witness the scene. </p><p>“Oh very well,” Celestia resigned. “Once again it appears I will be the mature one.”</p><p>“We shall gladly admit our immaturity on this matter,” Luna replied victoriously with a smile, comfortably falling back to her archaic dialect.</p><p>Celestia braced herself as she hesitantly pried the paper open. After several seconds without any explosions, both alicorns finally opened their eyes. Knowing she was safe, Celestia started to read, though there wasn’t very much. The letter consisted only of a single sentence. </p><p>“It seems,” Celestia spoke, all humor gone, “that the situation has already become more complicated.” Celestia offered the letter to Luna.</p><blockquote><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>I want to talk to her.</p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>~Rodney</p></div></blockquote><p>“I bet now you wish it had exploded, don’t you, dear sister?”</p><p>Celestia could only sigh.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 44 - Fancy meeting you here<br/>Edited by some crazy person (partially)</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>“There is no red pill, no blue pill. There is only, the pony.”</p></div><hr/><p>“Huh,” I mumbled, staring at the mirror. Standing in the bathroom with a towel wrapped around my lower half, I stared at my reflection. I took a step back and allowed a broader view of myself.  </p><p>“I’ve changed,” I concluded. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Finally noticed eh?’</span></p><p>Sharper, that would be the word to describe my new appearance. Perhaps it was because the change had been gradual and slow that I had failed to notice till now. It was only because of the new scars I had received that I gave my reflection a second look. </p><p>The scars obviously attracted the most attention, I knew I had gotten a scar on my back from that incident with Rarity’s fire ruby, but now I’ve got a few new additions in front. Courtesy of Falnor. I’ll always count myself lucky for making it out of that confrontation alive, and with all my limbs still attached and functional. Oddly the scars made me feel a sense of pride. Sure, I mostly ran around like an idiot, and who wouldn’t with a dragon chasing your ass, but by god, I survived a dragon! I’ll take that trade any day. </p><p>But the closer I looked, the more I noticed other subtle changes. There were still some fat on me, no doubt about that, but at least my stomach wasn’t as buldgy as it had been before. My muscles, especially around my chest and shoulders, were more defined. Even the fat on my face had receded, leaving my facial features more pronounced and my jawline sharper.</p><p>These were likely the results of living a more active lifestyle. Living here in Ponyville, I had come to realize that we humans had it easy with all our technology and innovations. You wouldn’t think a little bit of physical work every day would have much effect, but it did, and in the end, it all adds up.</p><p>Want food and groceries? Get your bag of heavy coins and walk to the market, stand all day bargaining, move to the next stall and do it again. Since Rarity was in the fashion and textile trade, I had to go purchase cloth and other raw materials in large quantities and carry them back. Of course a simple levitation spell was always on option, especially if the load was too heavy, however I had to be careful not to rely on it too much. The only way for me to replenish my own magic reserve was to take it from someone. Meaning constant vigilance not to waste when I don’t need.</p><p>According to Twilight’s explanation, ponies and most other natives of this world regain their magic from the world itself. Unfortunately she couldn’t explain the details on how that actually works, said that’s just how it’s always been.</p><p>Another odd realization was how indifferent I felt at the shackles on my arms. I remembered feeling uneasy and awkward when I first saw them. They really did make me look like an escaped convict, one with very expensive looking shackles. But now, well I suppose I had just gotten used them on. Even Rarity seemed to glean some inspiration for her designs from them. I had seen one dress that had small interlocking chains as part of the outfit. It looked a bit goth from my perspective. </p><p>Before I could appreciate my new visual appearance, I heard somebody knock the door. </p><p>“Anypony in there?” </p><p>“Be right out, Sweets,” I answered. </p><p>“Hurry! I’m going to be late!” she yelled shortly after, knocking impatiently. </p><p>I quickly dried myself and put my clothes on before stepping out, chains jingling loudly all the while. </p><p>“All yours Swe-woah!” Soon as I stepped out Sweetie Belle rushed right between my legs and slammed the door behind me. </p><p>“What’s gotten her in such a hurry?” I mumbled, staring at the bathroom door. </p><p>Leaving Sweetie Belle to do her morning routine in private, I started making my way downstairs and to the kitchen for breakfast. There I found the table already laden with food; fruits, bowls of hot oats, and some salad as an extra. </p><p>No matter how many days had gone by, I would still scan the breakfast table hoping to see bacon somewhere. I could only hope some pork nearby dies of unnatural causes soon. Don’t judge me, you would too in my position. Though I would then need to find someone willing and able to do the butchering. </p><p>“Morning Rares,” I greeted. She was in the middle of adding the finishing touches on the table. The occasion never really mattered to her, Rarity would always add a bit of garnishing to her cooked meals.  </p><p>“Goodmorning dear,” she greeted back in her usual elegant tone. “Your timing is impeccable, breakfast is ready.”</p><p>“I can see that.” I sat crossed legged on my usual spot at the table and waited. Similar to back home, it’s considered polite to wait till everybody is ready before you start eating, and Rarity is all touchy about etiquettes and manners. </p><p>“Anything happening today?” I asked. </p><p>Rarity took her seat across from me. “More or less the usual, I’ll be busy all day making new outfits. I have enough to work with so you don’t need to tend the shop.”</p><p>“If you say so.” Working for Rarity isn’t all that bad, on occasion she dives into her work full force which usually meant a free day for me. She hasn’t quite trust me to run the boutique all on my own, which is understandable since I had only just started rather recently. “And Sweetie Belle? Anything going on with her? She said something about being late.”</p><p>“Oh that’s right, school is starting again today,” she informed. </p><p>“School? I didn’t know she attended.” </p><p>“Well of course she does, why wouldn’t she?”</p><p>I shrugged. “You act as if that’s obvious but I’ve never actually seen her, or any other children in town go to school before. Now that I think about it, this is the first time I've heard the word ‘school’ being mentioned.”</p><p>At that Rarity seemed to realized something. “If you put it like that I suppose it makes sense. I think you arrived in town during school reprieve, that’s why you haven’t seen any of them attend.” </p><p>Seeing as this might lead to another chatty breakfast, I took the initiative and poured a cup of tea for Rarity and a glass of water for myself. </p><p>“In fact,” Rarity continued, “school was supposed to continue two weeks ago, but-”</p><p>“The dragon,” I figured. </p><p>Rarity nodded. “Everypony had to spend all their effort in getting the town back into shape, and we didn’t know if it was safe for the children to go to school with all the collapsed buildings and debris all about. Thus everypony agreed to suspend school activity till a safer time.” She sipped her tea. “Furthermore you spent most of your time recovering in the hospital, so it’s understandable if you’re oblivious to much of what happened after that horrid night.”</p><p>“I suppose with school starting again it means everything is starting to go back to normal?”</p><p>“That’s true. If you look outside you would question if Ponyville really was attacked by a dragon.”</p><p>“Anytime you need help convincing someone of that,” I raised a hand. “I’ll be more than happy to prove them otherwise,” I offered jokingly.</p><p>“Thank you dear but I don’t think that’ll be necessary,” she replied with a smile. A moment later Rarity got up, trotted towards me, and gave me a heartfelt hug. Her two forehooves rested over my shoulders while the side of her face pressed against my cheek. </p><p>I froze in place with my glass of water in hand, eyes wide in surprise at Rarity’s sudden show of affection. “Uh, Rarity?” I asked hesitantly. </p><p>“Just wanted to thank you again for what you did,” she answered softly. With the reason behind the hug revealed and the awkward feeling gone, I let her to cling unto me for a few more seconds before she finally let go. </p><p>Likely because she also heard Sweetie Belle coming down the stairs. She galloped into the kitchen and rushed to the table, carelessly knocking a few things over. Fortunately as both Rarity and I were accustomed to Sweetie’s wave of destruction, we caught each item with a spell and placed them back before any real damage was done. </p><p>As usual, Sweetie Belle herself seemed oblivious to it all. I’m starting to wonder if I should advise Rarity to bring her sister to the hospital for a checkup, both physical and magical. Sweetie Belle’s affinity for wanton destruction is just unnatural. </p><p>“Is it okay if I go to the clubhouse with the others after school?” Sweetie Belle asked excitedly. Without waiting for an answer she started eating her oats, though it looked as if she was more vacuuming it in. </p><p>“Manners dear,” Rarity reminded sternly, glaring disapprovingly at Sweetie’s behaviour. </p><p>“Showwy,” she quickly replied with a mouthful. After swallowing and remembering to breath, Sweets continued eating at a normal pace with a bit more etiquette. “So can I?”</p><p>“Just remember your saddlebag and be home before the sun goes down,” Rarity answered casually. Though I suspect deep down she’s somewhat relieved to have some peace and quiet in the house while she worked. </p><p>The three of us then went on with breakfast with the usual bit of conversation, mostly sharing each other’s plan for the day so we all know what’s happening. With the lack of instant and mobile communication like cellphones, it’s important that everybody make themselves aware of such things at the start of each day. That way we can find each other or notice when something’s gone wrong.</p><p>“I’ll be going now!” Sweetie Belle announced loudly as she stood by the front door wearing a small saddle bag. </p><p>“See ya Sweets!” I yelled from the kitchen while I cleaned the dishes. “Say hi to Bloom and Scoots for me!”</p><p>“Be careful now!” Rarity yelled after, still at the table calmly finishing her tea. </p><p>“Is it safe for her to go alone?” I asked, once I heard the front door open and close. </p><p>“She’ll be fine. They know to stick to the road at all times and everypony in town keeps an eye on them as they pass by,” Rarity answered. </p><p>“Hmm, if you say so.” </p><hr/><p><i>‘Has his clothes always been that tight?’</i> Rarity pondered as she eyed the human. His back was facing towards her while he was busy cleaning the dishes from today’s breakfast. Her eyes traveled over Rodney’s form, with her experience and expertise as a seamstress, Rarity had an eye for catching details. <i>‘He got bigger, just a bit. His mane is also longer.’</i></p><p>Rarity made an effort to remember that in case she needed to adjust his current attire or when making new ones. </p><p><i>‘In any case, now would be a good time as any.’</i> After a moment of careful consideration, Rarity decided that due to his mentality and nature, it would be fine to approach the matter casually. </p><p>“Rodney,” Rarity called out breaking the silence. </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“How are things with Shine lately?” she asked nonchalantly. </p><p>“Shine? She’s still alive, which is something if you consider how much time she spends with me,” he answered jokingly. “Why you ask?”</p><p>“As I recall the Princess sent her to,” she coughed, “ ‘help Twilight keep an eye on you’. Exactly how long is that?” </p><p>With a plate in hand he paused while tapping it, clearly thinking. “I never bothered to ask. I guess she’ll be around till otherwise told to,” Rodney answered as he resumed washing. </p><p>“I see,” Rarity replied thoughtfully. Silence followed as Rarity sipped her tea several times, carefully planning the proper words to say. “I guess that means you’ll be spending a lot more time with her,” said Rarity, hoping to inch the conversation a bit to her objective. </p><p>“Well isn’t that obvi-” Rodney suddenly looked up from the sink in a way that suggested he realized something. He turned his head and gave Rarity a serious look. “No,” he said, or rather, commanded. </p><p>“What?” Rarity asked feigning innocence. She wore her mask perfectly but deep down she was caught off guard. </p><p><i>‘Did I slip?’</i> she thought, surprised. </p><p>“I know what you’re doing, stop it,” he said with an irritated expression. </p><p>“And what exactly do you think I’m doing?” Rarity asked with a slight teasing tone, hoping his suspicions were misplaced.</p><p>Rodney sighed audibly. “Either you're fishing for gossip, or trying to hook me up with Shine.” He placed the last plate to dry on the side and wiped my hands before joining her at the table. He leaned in and stared right at her. “You’re getting neither.”</p><p><i>‘Close, but it’s not Shine I’m trying to “hook” you up with,’</i> Rarity thought silently. </p><p>“And why, pray tell, would you assume that?” she asked. </p><p>At that the human gave her an ‘are kidding me?’ look. “Have you read the books in this house? Aside from the reading material for customers and the library books I borrowed, all the books you own is one way or another; a romance. Ranging from heartache, drama, and whatever else.”</p><p>He paused for a moment whilst giving a smug look. “Sometimes it’s not that hard to figure you out Rares.”</p><p>She frowned at that remark, not insulted but neither was she happy to be told she could be so transparent. Despite having her intentions discovered, Rarity didn’t relent. Rather, seeing as it was out in the open, there were no reason to play around with words.</p><p>“Well then I suppose we can skip the formalities and get to the juicy center,” she declared. </p><p>“I don’t suppose that ‘No’ meant anything to you?” he asked irritably. </p><p>Rarity’s smile only seemed to widened at that. “So what’s the story between you two?” she asked with enthusiasm. </p><p>“You really aren’t letting this go, are you?” Rodney took a deep breath and exhaled loudly. “Alright let’s get this over with,” he continued before speaking in a very flat monotone manner. “I am not in any romantic relationship with Shine, or with anybody at the moment.” He marched forward till he stood over the table. “There is me, and that’s it. I have friends, like you, who happen to be female, but in no way approach what I consider as intimate.” He leaned slightly forward, eyes unfaltering as he stared Rarity down. “Does that answer your question boss?”</p><p>For a moment Rarity couldn’t think. She expected Rodney to deny such relationships with Shine, and she knew enough he wasn’t with anypony. But the degree and weight as he rebuked her further suggested that such notions will never occur. That threw her off as she gaped at the human, unable to respond. </p><p>“Uhm, Rodney dear,” she started, her tone wavering. Hoping that perhaps she misunderstood. “You will of course, one day, find somepony who-”</p><p>“No,” he interrupted, knowing what she was about to say. “I don’t see myself ever being in such a relationship with anybody.”</p><p>Again Rarity couldn’t respond, this wasn’t something she was familiar with. She was aware that somepony might possess more hardened hearts than others. But Rodney spoke with such conviction and in such a way that Rarity actually believed he would live throughout his life without intimate love.</p><p>As the type of mare she was, Rarity couldn’t fathom this. Nor could she accept it. </p><p>It seemed that this confusion and surprise showed through Rarity expression, which promoted Rodney to further explain his reasoning. He closed his eyes for a moment, as if in concentration, and reached upwards to the ceiling with an open hand causing his chains to jingle. Slowly blue flames appeared at the tips of his fingers as it closed in as if to grasp something invisible.</p><p>“Rwaaar!!” came a loud hiss from above. Rodney’s hand and fingers moved in motions where it gradually aimed towards the stairs in the living room. Soon enough Rarity spotted her pet cat Opal hovering down the stairs towards them, she too was wrapped with blue flames. Surprisingly the feline didn’t appear bothered by it, rather she looked absolutely annoyed at being levitated without warning and forcibly brought into the kitchen. She also seemed to be aware who was responsible, as she stared daggers at the human. </p><p>“Do you love Opal?” Rodney asked while said cat hovered towards Rarity. </p><p>“Why of course dear,” she answered, plucking the cat out of the air and into a gentle hug.</p><p>“Enough to give her some affection?” Rodney continued to ask. </p><p>“Of course.” She pulled Opal closer and rubbed her muzzle affectionately at the cat. </p><p>Rodney waited a few seconds before he asked the next question. “Enough for sex?” </p><p>“What!?” she screamed. </p><p>“RWAAAR!!” For whatever reason Rarity reflexively pushed Opal away with such force that the cat actually flew right out the kitchen. </p><p>“Opal!” Rarity yelled apologetically. She was about to chase after and check on her pet before spotting Opal quickly running back up the stairs, now looking livid. </p><p>Rodney on the other hand drank his cup of cool water with a smile on his face. “<i>That</i>, right there,” he spoke confidently, “is the exact same feeling I have.”</p><p>Rarity stared at the human, pondering his words.</p><p>“And it’s not just for you ponies,” Rodney continued, “I don’t see myself ever being in a relationship with anybody. To put it in a nutshell, having an intimate relationship with any being that’s different from my own kind, is very unlikely. It’s a stigma for me, one that I have serious doubts am able to break out of.”</p><p>Rarity drew a calming breath. “I...see. I had ideas but...”</p><p>“It’s fine,” he replied with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Considering how noisy you ponies are, I figured I’ll have to explain myself eventually.” With the dishes washed and drying, he made his way out of the kitchen. “Now with that out of the way, I’m heading out. I’ll be visiting Bronze before dropping by the library. You can find me there if you need to. I’ll be back to help you with dinner.” </p><p>As he exited the kitchen and headed towards the front door, a bag floated down the stairs much like how Opal did and flew to the human’s open hand. It was a simple bag Rarity made based on Rodney’s description that easily hung around his shoulder. </p><p>“See ya Rares.” And like that he was out the door, leaving a still somewhat confused mare sitting in the kitchen table. </p><p>At some level Rarity seemed to understand what Rodney was trying to say. If it really was such a strong stigma as he described it, a relationship would be almost impossible. At least that’s what most ponies would think. Rarity was not like most ponies.</p><p><i>Almost</i> impossible.</p><p>Oddly she felt a strong drive to suddenly help Rodney break out of his stigma. This was mainly due to the fact that she cared deeply for the human. To live one’s entire life without having someone to love and be loved in return was not something that she could accept.  </p><p>“This might be harder than I thought,” Rarity mumbled thoughtfully. </p><hr/><p>“Welcome to the-oh it’s you monkey.”</p><p>I stood some distance away, gazing at the building in front of me. “So it is true. You don’t just serve booze.” </p><p>“What?” Bronze Sky looked at the store behind him. “This?” Unlike most stores in town, the one Bronze stood in front of lacked any signs or banner to indicate the type of trade. But the fact is he doesn’t need one, one look at the shop and its clear to anybody what it was.  </p><p>An iron anvil stood in front at the center, worn with scratches and dents to show its age. There was a giant rack to the side, hanging from it were various tools of his trade; hammers of different sizes, pliers, a poker, and a few other things. But don’t assume they're exactly as you think they are, I had to give each a second look to realize what they were. These tools were the rare exception where they were actually designed to be used by ponies. Or at least, beings that couldn’t grasp like a human. </p><p>However the centerpiece was without a doubt the massive stone furnace built to the building at the other end. Along with the large chimney having above the whole thing easily dominated the front space of the store. Black and covered with soot and ash, the center glowed bright red even in the daytime. A small hose extended from the bottom which then connected to what looked like an air pump.</p><p>It was a metal shop, pure and simple. From the setup it seems Bronze would work and do his craft outside while all his finished products lay inside in the store. The shop appears to be connected to the bar as a single building, only the bar’s entrance is on the opposite side facing a different street. Were I to go down the side alley towards the back, I would find myself standing by the entrance of Ponyville’s one and only source of booze; The Bronze Sky. </p><p>“I never told you I own this?” he asked with a raised brow. </p><p>“No but Twilight did. Mentioned it a while back when we were still in the hospital.” I looked at his right wing, still encased with a cast. “How’s the wing?”</p><p>He moved it around a bit. “Getting there. If I’m lucky they’ll break it in a few weeks.” His eyes traveled up and down as he looked at me. “You’re looking good though.”</p><p>“Mostly.” I softly patted my side, indicating my rib. “This thing is still bothering me. But like you said, it’s getting there.”</p><p>He nodded and turned back to his work, which at the moment seemed to be filling the furnace with a bag of coal. Though it seemed like he was having some issues figuring out how, his wing being in a cast restricted his movements. </p><p>“Are you sure you should be working?” I asked worriedly, though I’m pretty sure I know the answer. “If Redheart sees you-”</p><p>“What’s she going to do? Drag me back to the hospital?” he asked with a laugh. He only got two laughs out before he stopped with a sudden worried look in his eyes. “Please don’t tell her.”</p><p>Fortunately my rib had healed enough to let me laugh without much pain, only some irritation.</p><p>“So what made you come by?” he asked with a grunt, trying to push the large bag of coal to across the floor. “Sorry to say but I ain’t ready to open the bar just yet.”</p><p>“That’s unfortunate, but no I’m not actually here for a drink.” I rummaged through the bag I carried and pulled out a book. “Here,” I approached him and held the the book open for him to see. “I’ve got some ideas and I need your help to see if they’ll work.”</p><p>He stopped pushing for a moment to stare at my drawing, eyes moving here and there. “Well, for one thing you can’t draw worth a feather,” he commented. </p><p>I rolled my eyes. “Can you fabricate it or not?”</p><p>“Nope.” He turned and went back to pushing, the rough floor making it difficult for the bag to slide across. </p><p>“Why not?” I asked. I reached forward with an open hand aiming for the bag as I cast a spell. Blue flames engulfed the bag before it floated up into the air. “Is it too difficult?”</p><p>“Thanks, just have it hover over the furnace.” I complied and with a few subtle finger movements the bag floated towards the furnace while Bronze took a large knife-like tool from the rack. “And no it’s not too difficult. I need more than just a pretty picture,” he mumbled, holding the knife with his jaw. He didn’t seemed bothered that the knife was covered in black soot, so I figured I shouldn’t either.</p><p>With my hand reaching to maintain the spell, I turned my attention to book, at the diagram I drew. Of course it wasn’t just a picture as Bronze had said, I knew enough that he would need some measurements along with it. Tried to make it as professional looking as I could, adding numbers for length, size, and so on.</p><p>“These measurements aren’t enough?” I asked.</p><p>“Not really. But that’s not the problem.” With the blade Bronze punctured the bag and ripped the bottom open. All the coal inside dropped into the furnace creating a dark cloud of soot and ash that exploded outwards into the street. </p><p>“Sorry,” Bronze apologized. I waved at the air in front of me clearing the black cloud away while I coughed the stuff out of my lungs. Luckily I reacted fast enough to snap the book shut, so my drawing should be fine. </p><p>“It’s alright. Rarity would be annoyed about getting dirty but that’s nothing new. So what was the problem then?”</p><p>With the same blade he poked and spread the coal evenly out till it flattened before placing it aside. “I need to know what it’s for. I can certainly make something with diagrams and measurements, but I need to know what I’m making. Or at least, what it is intended to be used as. That way I’ll know how to work the metal in order for it to perform effectively. Which part to make tough or flexible.”</p><p>“Can’t you just make it?” I argued, trying to convince him. “It’s just a prototype. Hell I don’t even know if it’ll actually work they way I think it would.”</p><p>“Well why don’t you just tell me what’s it for then?” he argued back. He gave me a smile. “Don’t worry I know all about keeping secrets. Let’s just say I’ve got a few clients in town who would prefer that I keep their orders private.” He leaned in close as his voice dropped to a whisper. “Let’s just say there’s a few ponies whose into some weird fetish and leave it at that.”</p><p>I sucked in a breath as I struggled to stop my imagination from projecting unforgettable images. Which was understandably difficult, add the fact that I could hear my subconscious only made it worse.  </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Pony BDSM? Has to be. Unless...well the gender ratio in town is severely unbalanced. Maybe something to keep the lonely mares company at nights? Like a dil-’</span></p><p>“Anyways!” I shouted, hoping to drown the image away. “Don’t worry about the integrity or stuff like that. Just make it with what you consider as ‘normal’, that should be enough.”</p><p>“Even if you don’t care, I do. I keep a minimum level of quality in everything I make, that includes forging things to their intended uses.” </p><p>Again, I had to stop from brain from hurting itself with horrifying images. </p><p>“Exactly what are you asking me to make monkey?” he asked. There was the tiniest bit of suspicion in his tone. By now I realized that arguing or avoiding any further would only make things worse, and if I just suddenly dropped the subject he’ll start pestering to tell him just for the sake of it. That’s just the type of pony Bronze Sky was. </p><p>I opened the book and showed him the diagram again, this time with a finger pointed at a specific part. “Everything should be rather sturdy. But this part right here, the chamber,” I tapped my finger at the diagram, just to make sure Bronze knows which part I was talking about. “This part needs to be as tough as you can make it. It’ll hold a lot of pressure and heat in instantaneous bursts.”</p><p>Bronze peered closer at the diagram, his muzzle almost touching the page. “Pressure and heat,” he mumbled. “I’m guessing magic is involved?”</p><p>“What isn’t?” I jokingly asked, hoping I don’t have to answer seriously.</p><p>“Any specific type of metal you want?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. Not yet anyways. This is just a prototype.” </p><p>Bronze hummed thoughtfully. “Most of it doesn’t look too difficult. But that part, the one you call ‘chamber’ is a bit complicated. This is a bit more intricate than what I normally make.”</p><p>I felt relief, it didn’t look like Bronze was going to poke for more information. Fortunately I managed to give enough information without actually giving any hints as to what I intend to use it for. </p><p>“It doesn't have to be perfect,” I replied. “Like I said it’s just a prototype, just testing if the idea could actually work. Just try your best.”</p><p>“Hmm, alright then. Let me have it.” With a big smile I carefully ripped the page of the book and handed it to Bronze. </p><p>“So how much would it cost exactly?” I asked, realizing we haven’t discussed the price. </p><p>“For something like this,” he said, giving the diagram another look. “About ninety bits.”</p><p>“Ninety!?” As a single purchase that’s fine, but seeing as I’ll likely make future orders with design improvements, this would be a costly endeavor over time. </p><p>“Something like that will take a while to make.” He smiled. “Don’t worry, just give me what you got and you can pay the rest whenever you’re able. Besides, I won’t be able to start making it for a good long while. With my wing as it is I won’t be able to move properly, meaning I’ll be working substandard. And after I have a few things to fix before I start on your little project.”</p><p>I looked at the building. “Dragon got your house?” I asked. There wasn’t much damage that I could see, they might have been there before.</p><p>“Nah, I got lucky. Though the roof needs new tiles from all the shaking.” He turned and trotted towards a corner, there laid a large cloth was covering something massive. “But more importantly I need to repair these.” With a bite, he pulled the end of the cloth to reveal a mass of mangled pieces of metal. What I recognized first was the large bronze colored shield he loved so dearly. The rest however looked like a pile of scrap metal. After a closer look though, I started recognizing parts of it and managed to put it all together in my mind. </p><p>“Is that...your armor?” I asked. “The one you wore that night?”</p><p>“The very same. With all that’s happened and being stuck at the hospital, I haven’t managed to make the repairs.” </p><p>He pulled apart one of the pieces to reveal the many tears and dents, some were twisted while others still has bits of broken green dragon scales embedded in them. Looking at the amount of metal, not counting his shield, it was easy to tell that flying with all that weight was an impossible feat. </p><p>Under ‘normal’ curcumstances at least. No doubt pegasi magic had something to do with it, after all, physically they wouldn’t have been able to fly in the first place with such small wings. Still, that’s a serious load to carry. If Rainbow was built for speed, Bronze was built for strength of flight. Like comparing a fighter jet to a transport plane.</p><p>“Yeah she’s mangled up good this time,” Bronze said worriedly. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘This time?’</span></p><p>“Not sure if I can repair it back to what it was. It might be better to melt it and remake the whole thing. But that’ll take months and who knows, I might need to save another hairless monkey from danger,” he added jokingly.</p><p>I ignored that last bit and simply stared at the mangled armor, then at Bronze sizing him up, and finally at his shop. It finally dawned on me that, despite what Bronze and I had been through, I know nothing about him. Not really.</p><p>“Bronze,” I started, now very much interested in finding out. “Who are you exactly?”</p><p>“Eh?” he replied, in a dumb fashion, no doubt making fun of me. </p><p>“I’m serious. Who are you really?” I started counting with my fingers. “First I thought you were just a regular bartender. Still weird to use your own name for the bar if you ask me.”</p><p>“It’s a good-”</p><p>“Second,” I continued, ignoring his interruption, “you came flying out of nowhere in full armor, diving headlong into a fight with a dragon. Drunk if I remember correctly!”</p><p>“I saved your sorry flank!”</p><p>“I know, and I am forever grateful for that. One day I’ll find a way to repay you for that. But still, nobody just does that. It ain’t normal!”</p><p>“Well I’m not normal!” he declared proudly.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘He can say that again.’</span></p><p>“And third!” I continued, the conversation somehow escalating into a shouting contest. “Celestia knows you! Ruler of Equestria knows you by name! Also...damn what was his name. Eh...that pegasus in charge of the Royal Guards that came to town.”</p><p>“Steadfast?”</p><p>“Yeah him! He visited us in the hospital while you were asleep, he didn’t say it but it looked like you were in the service with him. Meaning you were in the army!” I waved my hand towards the store behind Bronze, my chains jingling at the gesture. “To top it off, you run a metal shop. The only one in town as Twilight told me.” I paused to catch my breath, not realizing that I was getting a bit too worked up.</p><p>He waited for a few seconds while I tried to catch my breath, amused at the sight. “Do you need to sit down or something?” he asked mockingly. </p><p>I took a deep breath. “Look, all I’m saying is; who are you exactly? I mean, those that know you, the way you act, not to mention the skill set you possess. I might be new to you ponies, but I still know those things aren’t normal.”</p><p>I didn’t realize it at the time, perhaps I really wanted to know more about the pony I owe my life to, but I was being <i>far</i> too intrusive with all these question. Bronze might not have wanted to answer them. Luckily though, he didn’t seemed to mind. Heck he was probably enjoying the fact that I was so flabbergasted. </p><p>“Okay okay,” he replied with a humoured smile. “You want the long or short story?”</p><p>“The lo-” </p><p>“Short one it is!” he interrupted. I gave him an annoyed look which he seemed to relish. “Like I said, got a lot of work to do. Anyways, yes I was in the service, though I wouldn’t call it an army. I joined because I wanted to see more of the world, but didn’t have the finance for travel.”</p><p>“Wait, didn’t you say you wanted to own a bar?” I asked. </p><p>“No I liked drinking, that’s what my mark is.” His good wing moved to point at his mark, a foaming mug filled with amber liquid. Instead of a handle it had a pair of wings spread outward as if flying, a patch of cloud on the background depicted the mug’s flight across the sky.</p><p>I thought for a moment, remembering Sweetie Belle’s explanation about marks. “You’re special talent is flying drunk?”</p><p>“What? No! Well...maybe?” He shook his head. “I just like to drink okay! Now where was I?”</p><p>“You joined the service,” I reminded. </p><p>“Right. So I signed up, thinking I could still see the world while getting paid. Went through the training and all that, and was surprisingly good at it. Unfortunately a bit too well.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“It means that instead of being stationed at different parts of Equestria, I get sent to Canterlot Castle on guard duty! No offense to the Royal Guard but that’s not what I wanted. What they failed to realize was that I didn’t have the mentality to be a Royal Guard. Standing there like a statue for hours on end? Day after day? And they call me crazy?!”</p><p>I smiled. “Did they?” </p><p>“Not the point!” he yelled back.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Haha! That’s a yes.’</span></p><p>“As hard as I tried, I couldn't get out of it. So the Royal Guard it is. It wasn’t all that bad at first, thought I could pull through. But silent, the monotone existence, and especially the boredom, it all drove me closer to the edge. One day it really did push me over.”</p><p>Bronzed paused for a moment, his eyes moving to stare into the distance. No doubt reminiscing in past memories, though the memory must’ve been an enjoyable one. Bronze suddenly smiled broadly as he continued his story. </p><p>“Now I must’ve snapped or something cause I hardly remember what I did, I had to rely on the other guards to tell me what happened. So I was standing guard to the side like the others while The Princess was addressing some noble. Right where she was talking, I decided to scream.”</p><p>“You...screamed?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Yeah, not much to it, I just started yelling.” He then smiled with a prideful look. “Then I jumped out the window.”</p><p>I stared at him. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I jumped,” he repeated smugly. “I screamed, I ran across the throne room, and jumped out the window. Right there, in front of The Princess and everypony else. I should add that the window couldn’t be opened, one of those large stained glass.”</p><p>I closed my eyes and thought for a moment. I shouldn’t believe him, or at the least, have a hard time doing so. But after reconsidering everything that I know regarding Bronze, his behaviour and nature, it all suddenly became easier to believe.  </p><p>“I’m guessing you got in trouble for that?”</p><p>Bronze bellowed a loud laugh. “Actually I didn’t. Officially the incident was due to ‘stressful environment’. Now don’t tell anyone I said this, cause I’ll deny it, but shortly after that the Princess actually paid me a visit to thank me.” He smiled. “I must’ve left an impression.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Now that does sound like Celestia.’</span></p><p>I sighed with a smile, shaking my head. “So what happened after? Did you finally get out of guard duty?”</p><p>“Thankfully, yes,” Bronze answered. “Got a more active job in a patrol, watching the wilds and all that. Making sure all the dangerous creatures and animals stay where they should be.”</p><p>“Oh, so in the end you got what you wanted.”</p><p>“Sort of, not as much as I wanted but better than before that’s for sure. After I gave them my years, I quit. It was rough at first but if anything the training prepared me for the journey. At the end I saved up enough to actually travel anywhere I wanted to. Bought a large wagon, supplies, and just left.”</p><p>“Why didn't you just fly?” I asked confused. </p><p>“Are you serious?” he asked with a raised eyebrow. Seeing as I didn’t answer he started to explain. “Two reasons; first, and most important, is that I couldn't bring as many supplies if I flew. I'm strong but not that strong. Second, and I’m not sure if you noticed, but the sky is empty. Flying might be fast and all, but there’s nothing interesting up there. It’s just clouds. At most you can hope for a rogue thundercloud. To me the whole point of traveling is to experience every trot of the way. Both the good and the bad.”</p><p>For a moment there it sounded as if Bronze just gave me some sagely advice. Can’t be.</p><p>“So how far did you go?” I was pretty much hooked on his life story now. </p><p>He frowned, which confused me. “Not much I’m afraid. I managed to reach Yanhoover, but things didn’t work out there.” I could tell something bad must have happened, for split second I caught a look of regret. “I was so full of myself back then, and it all lead to one mistake.” He scowled. “One stupid, giant mistake. When the dust settled I found myself indebted to a pony.”</p><p>It was clear that he didn’t want to go into the details, with the way he brezzed through the story. Still, I tried probing for a few details. “You owed somebody bits?”</p><p>He chuckled. “I wish it was that simple. But no. Let’s just say I had to spend the next five years working for him.”</p><p>“Whoa five years!?” I yelled without thinking out of surprise. I was about to ask what happened, but thankfully I stopped myself. Realizing that I was treading on sensitive grounds. </p><p>His gazed off to the distance, most likely lost in a memory. “Care to guess what I spent five years doing? Here’s a hint.” He tilted his head to point at the shop behind.  </p><p>“That’s where you learned how to work metal?”</p><p>“Yup. The pony I worked for ran a similar shop. Was forced to learn the trade if I wanted to repay my debt and hold my honor. In fact it’s also where I made that.” With a hoof he pointed at the large bronzed colored shield. “That shield was the last thing I forged from there. Both he and I spent an entire month forging it with all the skill and knowledge we had. It was his goodbye gift to me. At first the days were like punishment, but looking back those years were the best years of my life.”</p><p>Silence followed, Bronze seemed to gaze further away into the distant. I was quite sure why but I felt compelled to wait, giving him some time in private with his thoughts. </p><p>“Did you finally get to travel then?” I finally asked. “After you paid your debt?”</p><p>“Nope. By that time the urge was gone. Looks like all the hammering I did have also beaten down my wanderlust. But at the same time I didn’t really have a place to go back to. I sold my home when I originally left, thinking I wouldn’t return. It would be nice to have stayed there at Yanhoover, but the situation didn’t permit. Too much bad blood.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Hold now, bad blood? The hell does that mean? Didn’t think these ponies can have bad blood.’</span> As tempting as it was to ask for him to elaborate, I held my tongue once again in respect and let him to continue his tale.</p><p>“In the end I decided to go back into service. Not that I wanted to, in fact I didn’t know what I wanted to do after I left Yanhoover. I just thought that protecting everypony sounded worthy of my time, at least till I find something.” </p><p>Bronze gaze went distant again, but not like before. He looked past me, at the street as ponies were going about their business. “Then on the way to Canterlot I dropped by this place. I was on the train and this was simply one stop along the way. I looked outside the window and just took in the sights. Not sure why, but it hit me that Ponyville might be a good place to die.”</p><p>I blinked several times. “What?”</p><p>“Ponyville is a good place to die,” he repeated. “Look around monkey. If you could choose a place to grow old, wouldn’t this be it? A lot of ponies would think a town like this would be dull and boring,” he gave me a knowing smile. “But you and I know better. <i>Things</i> happen in this town.”</p><p>“....I don’t think ‘dragon attack’ is a plus when choosing a home,” I pointed out. </p><p>“Like I said, I ain’t normal.”</p><p>I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. “So what about the bar? How did that happen?”</p><p>“Ah well, despite losing my will to travel, I still wanted adventures. So I thought, ‘why not at least hear it from those that had them’. What better way to gather adventurers than a bar? I had hoped to attract some stories as pony pass through town. Hear about the places they’ve been, who they met along the way.” He gave a long sigh. “But I didn’t exactly think things through. My mistake being that Ponyville isn’t exactly a tourist attraction.”</p><p>“No kidding.” If you judge from outward experience, Ponyville is the perfect, carefree, countryside town you’ll ever see. The only thing worth noting is the proximity to Canterlot, and maybe Sweet Apple Acres. But definitely not a place anyone would consider a tourist location.</p><p>“But still, I like to drink and the bar offered me reasons to keep ample supply.”</p><p>I laughed. “So basically you keep that bar open mostly for yourself?”</p><p>“Shhh! Not so loud,” he warned. “Nopony knows that.”</p><p>“Your secret is safe with me,” I assured him. “So you’ve been here since then?”</p><p>“Yup, and enjoying every minute of it for fifteen years.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Fifteen years?’</span></p><p>“How old are you?” I asked. </p><p>“I’ll be forty-six this year,” he answered casually. “Why?”</p><p>Being a different race and all, I find it difficult to judge a pony’s age based on looks. The fur covered most signs of age like wrinkles, except of course when you’re as old as Applejack’s grandmother. But forty-six? All this time and I never realized that Bronze nearly doubled my age. He certainly didn’t act forty-six.  </p><p>“You’re old,” I declared in a flat tone. </p><p>“Thank you for reminding me,” he replied, annoyed. “Now with my riveting life story over, could you please leave so I can get to work?”</p><p>“Hey sure, no problem.” I smiled. “Though you should be careful, wouldn’t want to pull a muscle with you age.” I dipped my head just in time as a large piece of charcoal flew over. Quickly making my escape, I turned gave Bronze a second look. I couldn’t help but see him under a different light, yet at the same time nothing about him has changed. Rather it solidified the things that make Bronze who he was. </p><p>Still the same drunken crazy pegasus who would fly right into a dragon to save somebody he hardly knew. Thinking back, this might have been the moment when I realized Bronze would be somebody I could rely on for a long time. Despite how annoying he can be at times. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><img src="https://camo.derpicdn.net/b415fdce5f16fe6c549720ec69c2a81e156b6430?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FO8FYnGT.png" /></p></div><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Golden Oak Library]=========</p></div><p>“...”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘So...what’s going on here?’</span></p><p>I stood there, just outside the library’s front door, staring at the scene before me with a flat expression. Looking around, I saw ponies going about their business. At most they would throw a glance but nothing else, which shows this was a common sight. </p><p>Turning my attention back at the scene, I stared at the pegasus whom I recognized, as well as her reputation. She’s the town’s only dedicated delivery pony, not much different from a mailman. Not the brightest of the bunch I can tell you that, caused and involved in plenty of problems all over town on a near daily basis. But everybody tolerates her, including myself. Even though I’ve only talked to her once, her cheerful personality was oh so very lovable. She’s like a child that never grew up, somehow retaining that innocence. </p><p>I’ll admit that it took me a while to acclimate to her...tendencies. If you think Sweetie Belle’s natural affinity for destruction was bad; you have not met Ditzy Doo. </p><p>At the moment, the pegasus in question was currently occupied trying to put Twilight’s mail in her mailbox. Apparently she’s trying to break the laws of space as she continues to stuff letter after letter inside, despite how it was already filled to the brim. Yet she kept at it, somehow finding a way to stuff in one more letter.</p><p>One problem though, there was a large sack resting next to her, and from the looks of it she intends to force them all in that one poor mailbox. An impossible feat unless one was a unicorn armed with some sort of space-bending spell to make the mailbox bigger on the inside.</p><p>“Uh, Ditzy,” I called, curiously, “what are you doing?”</p><p>“Delivering mail!” she replied cheerfully, one hoof forcing the letters to stay inside while the other pushes another one in. </p><p>“Why don’t you just drop them off the front door?” I asked, trying to keep the question from sounding insulting. </p><p>“Oh I can’t do that. That’s where I drop of packages, letters go into the mailbox. That’s why they call it a <i>mailbox</i>,” she explained as if teaching me. </p><p>“....I see.” Unable to find the energy or the will to argue with her, I turned my attention to the sack full of letters. “Are these all for Twilight?”</p><p>“Twilight got two letters today, and I already put those inside.” She turned and looked at me, or at least her right eye is looking at me. I should probably mention she was cross-eyed. “The rest are for you.”</p><p>My left brow rose. “For me? All of them?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>I reached down and pulled a letter from the sack. One the front, clear as day, was written:</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p><b>To Ponyville Human</b></p></div><p>The funny thing is, ‘Ponyville Human’ was more accurate than my own name. I don’t know if there’s anybody or anything out there that has the same name as me, but with this, there would be no argument as to who the letter was intended for. </p><p>What caught me by surprise though, was that the sender used what looked like crayons to write. Furthermore, the letters were resembled squiggly lines than actual letters, suggesting the writer was young and still learning. </p><p>Grabbing several more letters, I realized they really were all for me. A few actually did have my name, some only had ‘Human’, and one actually said ‘Monkey’. I’ve already decided not to open that one. </p><p>The obvious question would be: Where the hell did all this came from? It only took a moment of thinking for me to come up with a reasonable guess. </p><p>Being stuck in the hospital most of the time, and the recent incident with Jo, I had forgotten the fact that I was in the newspaper quite recently. Once you think about the circumstances, something like this should have been expected. The real question though, why the sudden appearance? I would have expected to receive a steady flow of letters, not a sudden sack full of them. It’s a very big sack.</p><p>“Seeing as their all for me and that I’m here,” I said, dropping the letters back in, “can I just take it?”</p><p>“Hmm I guess that’s ok.” Before I could say anything else she let go of the mailbox which immediately began spewing letters all over the ground. </p><p>I quickly covered the area with a spell, holding the letters in place before the wind could blow them away. I then lifted them all off the ground and pulled them back into the sack now in my hands.</p><p>“See you tomorrow,” said Ditzy cheerfully as she flew away. Her saddle bag of mail kept bouncing with each flap of her wings, sometimes a letter would fall out and dance in the air like a leaf. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘You have to wonder how mail in this town remains functional with her doing the delivering.’</span></p><p><i>‘Be nice.’</i></p><p>With a sack full of what I hoped weren’t hateful mail, I picked up a small rock and threw it at the library’s front door. After a few seconds of nothing, I threw another one before I finally heard movement inside. Rarity still haven’t finished my gloves, and I can’t really press her since she was making it out of the kindness of her heart. So for a while, throwing a rock at the door was the only way to knock without touching. </p><p>Twilight and I have already got a good understanding of how my touch would siphon magic, it being limited to the object I’m actually touching. The door should be safe, despite it being connected to the building it is still a separate object and not part of it. But we figured it be best to play it safe until we were both firmly aware and confident of how my natural abilities work in detail. Or at least until my gloves are done. </p><p>Shine appeared as the door opened, and immediately I noticed something was wrong. </p><p>“Rodney what did you do?” she asked. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh that’s never good.’</span></p><p>“I’m glad to see you too Shine,” I replied, ignoring her question. “How’s everything?”</p><p>“This serious Rodney,” Shine retorted. “What did you do?”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Ok, I’m getting nervous here.’</span></p><p>The fact that she didn’t even register the large sack of mail I was holding showed how troubled she was. Her eyes were staring straight at mine with a worried yet accusing glare.</p><p>“Okay look,” I started with a sigh, knowing trouble had just reared its ugly head. “Explain from the beginning, cause I really have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Is that Rodney!?” I heard Twilight yell from inside.</p><p>“Yes,” Shine answered back.</p><p>Suddenly my ‘Sense’ came alive as I felt the air suddenly shift, at least I thought it was the air. I didn’t realize it back then but what I actually ‘felt’ was the ambient magic twisting and converging at a point beside me. Next thing I saw was a familiar burst of purple light as Twilight teleported right next me, looking at me with the same accusing look as Shine’s. </p><p>I took a deep breath as I calmed my ‘Sense’, otherwise I tend to get overwhelmed with the amount of information. Like most sensory input, my ability to ‘Sense’ magic would ‘awaken’ itself when something significant happens, at least if I didn’t expect it. Had I known or expected Twilight to teleport in next to me, my ‘Sense’ would have remained dormant. It’s still somewhat vague in that regard, back then I had yet to dedicate myself to understanding and experimenting with my own abilities. Far too occupied with learning spells and runes. </p><p>“Check it out,” I spoke ignoring her look. “I got fanmail! Would you like to read them with me?”</p><p>“What did you do Rodney!?” she yelled looking up at me. Like Shine she didn’t even notice the sack.</p><p>“Look,” I sighed, a headache already starting to develop, “let’s all take a deep breath, and you two start explaining what got you all riled-” Again my ‘Sense’ woke up, though unlike with Twilight’s teleportation where it merely nudged at me, this time it screamed. </p><p>An insane source of magic had stepped into my ‘Range’, it felt like a furnace was slowly approaching and I was merely feeling the radiating heat. I recognized this, I’ve ‘felt’ it before, you don’t forget something like this. </p><p>Celestia was here, and based on my ‘Sense’, she was inside the library and approaching the front door. </p><p>At least that’s who I suspected at first, until my manly orbs suddenly decided to shrink. Shine trotted out of the way and gave a bow as the alicorn stepped out into view. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh-’</span></p><p><i>‘-shit.’</i></p><p>“Greetings Rodney,” she spoke. </p><p>“Oh, hey Luna,” I managed to mumble. “Fancy meeting you here.” An awkward silence followed as the two of us stared at each other. She didn’t look pissed, in fact her expression was unreadable. Which scared me even more. A few ponies stopped in their tracks to stare at the dark alicorn with reverence while others simply froze, eyes wide with surprise. </p><p>“So…” I started nervously, the silence becoming unbearable. “Did Celestia get my letter?”</p>

<p>So how should I apologize for this MASSIVE delay in update?</p><p>Actually scratch that, I won't apologize. Not really. I certainly regret that I couldn't work on this as much as I normally could. But circumstance got in the way. It's really that simple. </p><p>If you read my blog on this story, you'd know that I broke my arm. It's still broken, I'm still wearing the cast, typing is still a bit odd at the moment. </p><p>Still, even when I could work on this fic, I couldn't. The breaking of my arm put a strain on my job. The big bossman understands, hell I still got paid when I'm not working. But he expects me to make it up when I can, and that's what I've been doing. A huge backlog of work and all that, training the new kids, making sure their scripts work, stuff like that. </p><p>Seeing as how late it's been, I choose to upload this chapter without my editor's consent. Though I did edit it myself as much as I could. Please, if you spot a mistake I would appreciate it greatly if you could comment on it. </p><p>Thanks again for sticking to this fic after the long absence. I'll try to make it up with a special chapter or something.</p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 45 - Scatterbrained<br/>Edited by AndyGrey<br/>Pre-read by AndyGrey</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>“Hasbro does not own ponies. Ponies own Hasbro. A part of their master plan for world conquest.” <br/>~ From operative within Hasbro before he went missing</p></div><hr/><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Two days ago, Canterlot Castle]=========</p></div><p>“What do you mean I can’t go in!?”</p><p>“Direct orders from The Pr-”</p><p>“The Princess! I know!” Inquest yelled. “You said that already!” He glared at the guard, wishing he could just teleport the stubborn pony atop Canterlot mountain. He could, of course, but that would only worsen his already strained relationship with Princess Celestia, and Princess Luna harbored no favors for him. </p><p>Still recovering and physically confined to bed, Inquest was forced to teleport himself along with his bed and everything attached. Once out, he simply levitated his way towards the sky bridge leading to the research wing. Only to find it heavily guarded. At first he was relieved to see the place under such extreme security, but was immediately angered to find himself barred from entry. </p><p>“Inquest!” a voice chouted from behind. Unable to even turn his head around to look, Inquest was forced to rotate his hovering bed towards the voice. He groaned at the sight of Captain Shining Armor’s approach.</p><p>“Unless you’re here to order these stubborn fools out of my way,” Inquest spoke in a heavy and tired tone, “I suggest you turn and trot away. I have neither the time nor the energy to argue with you.”</p><p>“You are injured!” the Captain shouted. </p><p>Inquest glanced down at his body, two of his limbs heavily bandaged and hanging off supports. His eyes widened in a feign look of surprise. “No? Really!?” he replied with heavy sarcasm.</p><p>Inquest knew such a response would serve no purpose but only worsen the situation. But at the moment he didn’t care, either due to being heavily medicated or simply because he was still mentally exhausted, likely a combination of both. Certainly not the best condition to approach the ‘visitor’, but time was ticking and he needed answers to crucial questions. </p><p>He needed to interrogate this ‘Jo’ as soon as possible. </p><p>If Inquest’s reply had any effect, the Captain didn’t show it. His stoic glare remained as he move right next to Inquest’s hovering bed. “Should I remind you that you are currently under tight scrutiny of the nobles? After the damage you’ve done, losing your title should be the least of your worries.”</p><p>Inquest glared hard at the Captain, eyes unflinching and fierce. “Thirty-seven ongoing research destroyed. A hundred and eighty-nine ongoing experiments stunted or botched beyond salvage. Roughly  three-hundred-and-sixty-four-thousand bits worth of destroyed machines, tools, and instruments. Twelve of which were prototypes created by myself. Including the battery gems and damage to the building, I estimate the total cost of my actions to match what Equestria generates in three-point-two years. But those are merely monetary costs, the loss of data and potential discoveries I have thwarted, those costs are incalculable.”</p><p>The air filled with tension as Inquest’s expression hardened. </p><p>“And I would do it again,” Inquest continued, his voice was low and calm, yet it seemed to carry a great weight. Shining Armor had to struggle not to flinch. “I am fully aware of the extent of my actions. I don’t need anypony to tell me what I have or have not done. Especially not from a youngling like you. I’ve held my position and done my part in defending Equestria longer than you’ve been alive <i>colt</i>.”</p><p>Shining Armor couldn’t argue against this fact, it was all true. He would never admit it, but at one point in his life Shining Armor looked up to and perhaps even idolized the old pony. He heard the rumors, the stories, read in detail Inquest’s accomplishments. Many originally assumed Inquest’s greatest gift to Equestria would be in the progress and research of magic as well as in advising the Princesses. </p><p>But many then realized that Inquest is a unicorn of many gifts. He has acted as ambassador and once helped the Gryphons select their next leader. But most of all, he was willing and able to take action when it was needed. </p><p>An avalanche threatened a community of bisons at the foot of the Frozen North. They were saved simply because The Professor had been there to study their unique powdered medicines. Such feats of magic and bravery were inspirational to many, though some found it hard to believe a single pony could accomplish so much. It was only when Shining Armor obtained his position that he gained access to certain sensitive information. He quickly discovered what he had known about the old pony hardly scratched the surface. </p><p>Despite knowing all this, Shining Armor would not back down. He might not have matched his accomplishments to Inquest, but he was still Captain of the Royal Guard. He was the Princess's guardian and protector of Equestria’s seat of power. He worked tirelessly, literally through sweat, magic, and blood to earn his rank. </p><p>He would not back down. Not even from his childhood hero.</p><p>“Return to your room,” Shining ordered with renewed determination. His voice and tone matching Inquest’s in intensity. </p><p>Perhaps it was because both were unicorns, for as they glared each other down with neither flinching or giving in, magic seem to hum in their confrontation. Whether or not their realize it, both horns had a near imperceivable glow as their determinations clashed. For the two unfortunate guards nearby, it suddenly felt harder to breathe, hair standing on ends as static seem to crackle in the air. </p><p>If there was a sudden opening for an expedition to the deepest depths of Tartarus, they’d jump in. Anything to get out of this situation.</p><p>“That’s quite enough you two.” To the relief of the guards, the tension in the air completely dissipated as both Inquest and Shining Armor turned and immediately bowed, though Inquest only managed a low nod.</p><p>Celestia trotted with an air of calm, casually gazing at the two with a slight irritable expression. </p><p>“You know it saddens me to see you two so hostile towards each other,” she spoke, her voice ever so motherly. </p><p>“I apologize Princess.” Shining Armor distanced himself from The Professor further nullifying the hostility. “But The Professor refused to return and is demanding entry into the research wing.”</p><br/><p>Celestia sighed. “Captain, I would like a private moment with The Professor please.”</p><p>“Of course Your Highness.” With a bow both Shining Armor and the guards trotted away. </p><p>Celestia waited till they were out of earshot before she started. “What do you want Inquest?” she asked in a flat tone. </p><p>“To interrogate the ‘visitor’,” he replied in an equally monotone voice. </p><p>“Can this not wait till after your recovery?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“For two reasons. One, I believe time is a factor here. I have no proof of this other than my instincts, I simply feel that we must act now. Two, I also need to create a more suitable containment for the ‘visitor’. Due to circumstances at the time, I was rushed in creating the prison without due planning. It was merely to hold her long enough till I am able replace it with something more appropriate.”</p><p>Celestia closed her eyes in thought while Inquest waited for her judgement. </p><p>“I shall grant you access,” Celestia began, “but only for you to create a better prison. Not for any interrogation.” Celestia expected Inquest to argue but he merely waited expressionlessly for her to finish. “You will also be accompanied by no less than six guards at all times during the entire process. Am I clear?”</p><p>“Then exactly when will she be interrogated?”</p><p>“Soon. I am currently contemplating how to approach this matter.” Celestia paused for a moment. “We are not the only ones who wish to question her.”</p><p>“The human,” Inquest replied immediately. </p><p>Celestia smiled at this. Inquest hardly needed any time to contemplate to deduce that answer. Age had not dulled his sharp mind, it may have further polished it. </p><p>“I strongly object to this Princess,” Inquest advised. </p><p>“Under what grounds?”</p><p>“Whatever it originally had planned, the ‘visitor’ obviously needed the human-”</p><p>“Rodney,” Celestia interrupted. </p><p>Inquest nodded. “The ‘visitor’ obviously needed Rodney for something. She did, after all, target him in the first place. Having him so close to her, even under watch, may prove to be a mistake. At least not until we know, explicitly, what her objectives are. ”</p><p>“You prefer them kept afar?”</p><p>“Yes. Though I understand him wanting to question her. In the brief time they interacted, I saw Rodney had been greatly disturbed. What they spoke about I cannot say. It is perhaps best that we question him as well. He might know of her intent.”</p><p>“...I will take that under advisement. Though I will not coerce him. What he chooses to reveal will be up to him.”</p><p>While he didn’t agree with that decision, Inquest choose not to argue against it. “I would also wish to implement a strict rotating system when guarding her. As I’ve said, this creature has an uncanny means subvert one’s mind. No less and no more than two guards should venture inside for inspection, and should be given two days reprieve to recover from any mental tamperings. Despite her ability, she would still need a certain amount of time to implant any suggestion or gain control.” </p><p>Celestia gave him a nod. “I will allow you to work together with the Captain on both rotations and creating the new prison.” Celestia gave Inquest a look as he grumbled. “Be nice to him Inquest.”</p><p>“Fine,” he sighed. “I suppose making him feel important once in a while won’t hurt.”</p><p>Celestia could only shake her head. </p><p>“When and who will question the human? As I’ve said before, keeping him away from her is imperative. So it’s best if we send someone to him rather than bringing him here.” </p><p>Celestia gave him a nod. “Would you care to go? After you’re done?”</p><p>Inquest thought for a moment but shook his head after. “It’s best I stay here, close to the ‘visitor’ as I can be. I’m needed both in keeping her imprisoned and recapturing her should she escape.” </p><p>Much as she wished to give Inquest the rest and relaxation he needed and earned, Celestia couldn’t argue against that reasoning. Even if she could, Inquest will no doubt talk himself out of it, as he always did on such topics.</p><p>“Then who would you recommend?”</p><p>Inquest’s first impulse was to choose Captain Shining Armor, just so he could be rid of him. But then another idea came to mind. Celestia chose not to question the human under duress, but there was another who could challenge her authority. That’s not to say she would, but her presence alone tended to place  ponies on edge. She had her own ways of getting answers. </p><p>Inquest smiled. “I have somepony in mind.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Presently, in Golden Oaks Library]=========</p></div><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Oh god this is so uncomfortable!’</span></p><p>That was an understatement. After our initial meeting in front of the library, Luna and I moved to the main room of the library. Luna told the others, not so subtly I might add, to leave while she and I have a moment of privacy. So at the moment Twilight, Shine, and Spike are somewhere in town doing...whatever. </p><p>So now it’s just me and Luna, alone, and neither of us have spoken anything. Which made things tense and worrying. She was just sitting there across the table staring at me. I can’t even tell whether she was accusing me of anything or not, she’s impossible to read. </p><p>I tried several times to start a conversation, but every time my voice would get stuck at the last moment. Once I actually ended up choking. Despite how suffocating the anticipation was, I also didn’t want the conversation to start. Considering recent events, it was easy to guess why she came. Furthermore this visit was...different. For one thing none of her usual guards were nearby, in fact I saw no sign of them anywhere. Which likely meant this visit was ‘behind the curtains’ as they say. </p><p>“Rodney.”</p><p>“Ah!” </p><p>Ok, I for one would like to just say that I was merely startled hearing her call me all of a sudden. My voice did not, in any way, ever come close to what anybody would consider as ‘girly’. </p><p>“Uhm, sorry.”</p><p>While her expression was still stoic, she did tilt her head slightly to the side as if puzzled. “What happened during your abduction?” she asked, her voice calm and clear. </p><p>I didn’t immediately answer her. Rather I spent a few moments contemplating how or whether or not I should really answer that question. Knowing this was coming, I had originally come up with some semblance of a plan. But I never expected Luna herself to question me, I was expecting some official or a member of the Royal Guards. So what plan I had went out the window. </p><p>“Uhm,” I mumbled while nervously twirling my fingers, and old habit. “N-no comment.”</p><p>“Do you know this entity?”</p><p>“No. This is the first time we’ve met.”</p><p>“Hmm, though reports mention you seemed to-”</p><p>“No comment.”</p><p>“I see.” She didn’t press for answers, but merely stared at me again in silence. That only made me more nervous. </p><p>Then, out of the blue, she asked, “So have you begun to teach?”</p><p>“...What?”</p><p>“Teach,” she repeated, this time with a smile. “Is that not what you said you wish to do? School has already begun if I am not mistaken.”</p><p>“I...” It took me sometime to actually remember what Luna was talking about. Yes, last time we talked in person was back in Canterlot. I had in fact told her I wanted to be a teacher, which she encouraged. To her that might have been my entire reason to leave for Ponyville. </p><p>“Well-uh, no. I mean not yet.” I answered, the nervousness slightly ebbing. “I kinda got caught up in some things. First I was focused in making sure the town accepts me, you know, so they don’t go all crazy with this.” I raised an open hand and from my palm blue fire ignited to life as I focused my magic outwards. </p><p>“A wise decision. Though from what I’ve heard it was a rough road.”</p><p>I sheepishly scratched the back of my neck. “Yeah, you could say that. It’s how I ended up living with Rarity. I’m kinda indebted to her for...things.”</p><p>“Things, as in, levitating her entire abode and throwing the entire town into panic?” </p><p>Surprisingly I managed to smile and even chuckle. “Yeah, something like that. But completely an accident! I swear!” I quickly added.</p><p>“Yes, I know,” she replied calmly. “And of course, then comes the dragon.”</p><p>I gulped. “Yeah, him too.”</p><p>Her horn started to glow softly as a pair of cups levitated from the kitchen towards us. As it landed on the table in front of me, I saw it was already filled with golden liquid. Tea no doubt. But something confused me. I held the cup, felt its warmth, and turned to look at the kitchen. </p><p>“Did you…” I glanced at the cup, at the kitchen, then at Luna. “Did you make this?” With a curious look she gave me a nod. “Just now?” Another nod. “How exactly?”</p><p>“I don’t understand, I simply made it. Twilight keeps a small supply in case my sister happens to drop by for a visit.”</p><p>“But you made it just now right? How did you make it without actually being in the kitchen? Even if you knew where everything was in the kitchen, to make this with magic without actually being there is, well, just how? Did you actually control each object, draw water, steep the tea, drain it and serve with magic and without looking? How could you even tell where things are?”</p><p>Luna looked at me, her smile widening. “Now I see what Twilight means.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Luna chuckled lightly, which sounded almost like bells. “As you know Twilight keeps both my sister and I informed of your progress.” I nodded at that, it was obvious. “Out of the many descriptions she has for you, the one most often mentioned would be ‘scatterbrained’. And I can see why.” I’m not exactly sure what expression I had but Luna chuckled again at my reaction. “I’m certain she meant it in the best way. In fact, that’s exactly how Celestia describes Twilight when she reminisce. Always leaping onto something new, trying to learn everything at the same time and hungry for more.” She gave me a smile while taking a sip of her tea. “You see? Scatterbrained.”</p><p>“Whatever,” I grumbled, not quite buying her reasoning. </p><p>Luna’s smile merely widened at that. “But back to the original topic, are you still interested in teaching?”</p><p>I sighed. “To be honest, not at the moment. I spend most of my time working the boutique and studying with Twilight. Most of my free time goes to learning runes.”</p><p>“Ah, runes. A favoured subject of mine. A warning however, it is a venture you must commit a great deal of time in order to truly earn its benefits. No matter how talented one is, you will need to spend decades to truly master.”</p><p>“As Twilight have warned me, and I’m starting to see that as well. I’m already having trouble with the introductory books Twilight gave me. Also doing the actual engraving is getting costly, I’m going to have to save up to buy the proper tools and stuff. But as I’ve told Twilight; I have a feeling it’ll be worth it. There’s something there. I just know it.”</p><p>Luna gave a nod. “Hold to that feeling, in this age many have forgotten how to listen to their instincts.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Well you certainly won’t have that problem eh?’</span></p><p>“But I still encourage you to teach, not only for your future students but for yourself. Ponyville school would be an excellent start. You will learn the small nuances of our world and customs by simply being there and observing the children behave.There is plenty to gain and little to lose.”</p><p>I gave her words some thought. She was right, just because I’m a teacher doesn’t mean I won’t learn anything. Despite the amount of time I’ve already spent in this world, there are a few things I still find strange and odd. Who’s to say I won’t insult someone or break a taboo by accident due to ignorance. Still, the question remains, the hell am I suppose to teach?</p><p>“I’ll think about it.”</p><p>“That is all I ask,” she replied with a pleased smiled. “Now, where are you and what are you having trouble with?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Did I not mention that runes are a favoured subject of mine?” she reminded. Luna threw a look as she sipped her tea. “If I were you, and I found myself in the presence of a wise and experienced individual…”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Self-praising much?’</span></p><p>“...who happens to be a master of an art that I endeavour in. Would it not be a wasted opportunity if do not ask for some guidance?”</p><p>My face was split into a wide smile that showed my teeth as I, almost without effort or thought, magically pulled out an empty book and writing utensils from Twilight’s personal supply cabinet. I’ll apologize and pay for them later. </p><p>Luna mirthfully laughed, certainly delighted at my sudden enthusiasm. “I thought as much.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Many hours later, Canterlot Castle]=========</p></div><p>Celestia impatiently tapped the floor with a hoof. She tried her best to divert her attention, but even revisiting tax laws could only do so much. She was tempted numerous times to send an envoy to Ponyville, or a letter to Twilight. But she knew Luna would disapprove, she was entrusted with this task and any attempts to pester or question her progress would only draw her ire. Luna had always been the type of pony to finish what she set out to do at her own pace. </p><p>Though at times, Celestia wondered if Luna purposefully prolong her tasks just to irritate. </p><p>Gazing out the window of her private room, Celestia watched as the sun continue its slow descent over the horizon. As a precaution she closed her eyes and attuned herself to the burning celestial body, double checking if everything is in order. Finding things as it should be, Celestia let out a tired sigh as she continued to wait. </p><p>“Luna, what are you up to?” she spoke nervously, her voice barely a whisper. </p><p>Celestia’s hoof started tapping the floor.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Golden Oaks Library]=========</p></div><p>“I’m not asking whether it’s possible or not! I’m asking, <i>if</i> it’s possible, is there a limit to rune size?”</p><p>“Rodney, how many times must I repeat myself? No instrument of any kind can engrave runes at a scale as you described! The idea is unfeasible!”</p><p>“But let’s say we can!” I yelled defiantly. </p><p>Luna let out an audible sigh. “Then yes, I would say there is a limit. You cannot infinitely make runes smaller. Though I doubt we would ever need to engrave runes in the...what was it you called it?”</p><p>“Microscopic,” I answered. </p><p>I drank what might have been my seventh cup of tea before grabbing the pot and refilling it again. What started as a teaching session quickly turned to an all out debate regarding both practical and theoretical knowledge on runes. As our arguments of what’s possible and impossible with runes became more heated, we started shouting till our throats dried out. Hence the ever flowing tea. I don’t even like the stuff, a bit too bitter for my taste. Though I really didn’t care, I simply drank what was there to wet my throat so I could throw my arguments back at Luna’s face. </p><p>I had also given up writing all this down, my hand still ached from all the writing. Besides I had gotten enough earlier on to give me a head start on my own studies. Still there was plenty of loose paper strewn about the large table. Most were my work, notes from Luna’s impromptu study session. But a few contained diagrams, magically drawn by Luna herself, detailed drawings of runic designs and their workings that were <i>way</i> beyond my understanding. Though it would end up being extremely helpful later on as I approached more advance material.</p><p>Needless to say that both of us lost track of time, or even if we didn’t, neither of us wanted to stop. It became a matter of pride almost, neither of us wanted to let the other have the last word. This was as fun as it was enlightening for me. </p><p>“I cannot even imagine how complex and delicate such an instrument must be in order to engrave runes at such a minute scale.” Luna shook her head in disbelief. “Smaller than the edge of a single strand of hair, preposterous.”</p><p>I merely rolled my eyes at that. “You know, for someone who calls herself “wise and experienced”, you’re surprisingly closed minded.” Luna’s eyes quinted ever so slightly as she stared me down from across the table, looks like she took offense at that. “If you could create runic systems at such a level, it opens up new doors to incredible things. For one thing, objects like tiny accessories that were once too small to work with suddenly becomes viable. Heck pretty much anything becomes viable if you can engrave on a microscopic level.”</p><p>Despite that argument Luna didn’t seem satisfied after being called “closed minded”. </p><p>“Look, we’re just throwing ideas here. Of course I know it’s not possible, <i>yet</i>. But it’s certainly an interesting idea isn’t it? That’s kind of the problem I’ve noticed with you ponies.”</p><p>This certainly took Luna’s attention. “Would you care to elaborate on that?” she asked with a raised brow. </p><p>“Well, to put it simply, you ponies lack imagination.” Luna’s mouth had already moved but before she could get a word out I continued. “Actually, sorry, I think “imagination” is the wrong word to use. And in no way am I saying you ponies are dumb,” I quickly added. “I mean, have you met Twilight?”</p><p>This caused Luna to chuckle. </p><p>“Twilight’s intelligent, talented, driven, all that and more.” I scratched my head as I tried to piece together a way to properly explain what I meant. “Which is why I find it odd that I managed to impress her so easily. Like <i>really</i> impress her.” I casually raised a hand and gathered a small amount of magic to the surface of my skin, making it burn like a torch with blue flames. “Pretty sure you’re aware that Twilight’s been doing research on my magic and all that, how it works, unique properties, etc.”</p><p>Luna gave a confirming nod. </p><p>“Well, what I meant by impressing Twilight has nothing to do with my magic.” The flames winked out as I pulled it back inside me. “I’m talking about ideas. Not a theory or even a hypothesis, just ideas based on what I’ve read and what I learned from her. A few actually drove her up the wall when I shared it with her.” I relaxed and leaned back as Luna patiently waited and listened to my explanation, which went on longer than I expected. </p><p>“So, Twilight, being far more intelligent and knowledgeable than most, if not all ponies, acts as an excellent test base for Equestria’s accumulated knowledge on magic. Thinking about it longer, I realized there’s a good chance that the ideas I share, the ones that surprise or impressed her, were of ‘the first’. And what I mean by that is, until I arrived in this world, nobody has ever thought of them. Or at least, not yet or in the way that I had.”</p><p>I paused to let that last sentence linger. Luna’s far-off look showed she was mulling this over, at least I think she is. Expecting a counter argument I waited, but seeing as she didn’t speak after some time, I took that as a sign to continue. </p><p>“I’m more inclined to say that it’s a difference in how we think. Now I’m not saying that all humans are like me. I’m not saying that I’m special or unique amongst humans, it’s quite possible it’s just who I am.” Then, finally, it clicked. With a clap, which startled Luna, I continued with a smile. “Explorers, that’s what you're missing.” </p><p>“Explorers? Let me inform you that ponies, especially pegasi, are excellent explorers. And we have more than enough.” Luna informed. “And I don’t see how being an explorer has anything to do with-”</p><p>“Not in the traditional sense, no,” I interrupted. “I’m talking about the mindset. Researchers like Twilight break things apart, see them in detail, and try to figure out how each component work with one another. They focus on the question; how does it work? But explorers have a mindset optimized for discovery. Rather than breaking things apart to answer ‘how?’, they do it to answer; what’s possible?”</p><p>This, finally seemed to click for Luna as I noticed her eyes widened ever so slightly. “I see,” she confirmed. “This is rather enlightening. Continue.”</p><p>“The main difference between Twilight and I is not in how we learn or discover, we pretty much do the same thing. We break things apart to its components and research them. The difference, is the question we’re trying to answer. Again, Twilight is mainly interested in knowing <i>how</i> things work. Where as I ask the question; what can I make these components do for me? That’s discovery. That’s how explorer’s think.”</p><p>“And how exactly do <i>you</i> go about answering that question?” Luna asked, her eyes curious. </p><p>I shrugged. “I just mess about.” Luna would never accept that as an answer, and I knew that, which is why I gave it. Just to dangle the real answer a bit for fun.</p><p>“And exactly how does this “mess about” work?” she asked irritably. </p><p>“Not sure really. It depends. We break something apart and find A, B, C, and D. Twilight and I would then figure out how each work with one another. However, when putting them back together I would go B, D, A, and C in that order then see what happens. You know, mess about.”</p><p>“And what happens if that combination results in something dangerous? Something you can’t foresee? Your idea of ‘messing about’ sounds like a recipe for disaster.”</p><p>I gave Luna another carefree shrug. “Never said exploring is risk free. All we can do is pray and hope to survive whatever discovery we stumble upon.”</p><p>“Truer words have never been spoken. Which is why I find it hard to believe it came from you,” Luna replied mirthfully. I rolled my eyes letting that jab pass by. “Thank you Rodney. That has truly been enlightening. Though I must rebuke you, we do have ponies such as you describe.”</p><p>I waved that off. “Of course, I’m sure there are. What I’m arguing is that maybe we humans have more of them in number than you do. Perhaps we’re simply more inclined to that kind of mindset. But look, I’m not trying to make myself grander or larger than I am. I’ve just been wondering why Twilight seemed so easily impressed by ideas that, for me, seemed to come naturally. Besides, just thought you’d like to know the reason should you see Twilight acting all crazy and driven all of a sudden.” I smiled. “Well, more than usual.”</p><p>Luna laughed. “I appreciate that. Thank you.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I hope this doesn’t jinx it, but did we just had a pleasant evening with Luna?’</span></p><p>My smile widened. <i>‘I guess we did. Who would’ve thought.’</i></p><p>“Well I suppose it is time I head back,” Luna informed. She stretched her neck here and there getting the stiffness out. I stood and did the same, cracking a few joints in the process. </p><p>“Holy damn what time is it?” I looked out the window to see it was already night. “Shit, I told Rares I’d help with dinner. Sorry Luna but I gotta split.” I quickly gathered all the notes, loose papers, and carefully stuffed it inside the book I used. </p><p>“Ah, I almost forgot.” Luna turned to look at me with a flat look. “In regards to your letter; due to the complexity and sensitive nature of the situation, your request has been denied.”</p><p>Hearing that, my hand immediately froze. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Ah, looks like I did jinx it.’</span></p><p>It was only for about a second before my brain kicked back into gear. “Yeah I figured that would be the case,” I replied, faking a casual tone. “Didn’t think you guys would let me. Still, figured I should at least try.”</p><p>There was a lingering silence as Luna gazed at me, likely analyzing my reaction and what not. “May I ask the reason behind such a request?” she eventually asked, her eyes still analyzing. “There's no doubt that <i>she</i> is no ally, which makes your request that much more...confusing.”</p><p>Should I explain why I’ve refuse to answer her questions? If you think about it logically, there really isn’t any reason why I shouldn’t. In fact, I should cooperate with Celestia and Luna regarding the incident. It might be the only way they would allow me to talk to her. </p><p>But that’s never going to happen. This…this was too close to the heart. That might sound cheesy and cliche, but that’s the truth of it. I wanted to see her, but I know that face is just a fake. I wished to hear her voice, but she would use it to lie. I knew if I reached out to feel her skin, she would hurt me in return. I even prayed to forget her, but now she’s always in my dreams.</p><p>“The reasons are my own,” I answered, in a tone that told her not to question it any further. “However,” I continued hesitantly, “it's nothing...damaging for you or Equestria. It's purely personal.”</p><p>Luna gave a nod as if she understood, whether she did or not I’m not sure. “In that case, I shall convene with Celestia again and discuss this further. Nevertheless, I thank you for your time. This was a pleasant evening. It was refreshing. Far more enjoyable than dealing with wor-” Luna suddenly shut her mouth tight, her eyes slightly wide. </p><p>I too froze, though I had a huge, and I mean huge grin spread across my face. I caught that slip. </p><p>“Luna,” I called slowly with a slight teasing tone. “You wouldn’t happen to have spent all this time with me just to skip out on your responsibilities did you?” Luna’s lips pressed tight as she suddenly found the wall to the side interesting enough to stare at. “You couldn’t be. Cause that would be awfully irresponsible thing to do. Certainly not the kind of behaviour suitable for someone of your stature and position. Imagine, Princess Luna, skipping work. The scandal! How would your subjects react to that I wonder?”</p><p>“Oh enough with thy allegations! Thou art dismissed!” she snapped. Apparently I had annoyed her enough for her to revert back to that olden style speech manner. She gave me a murderous glare full of ill intent, which would have been effective were it not for the embarrassed blush on her cheeks.</p><p>I had a lingering suspicion Luna might have let that slip intentionally for my own sake. Just to diffuse the tension. If she did, I can respect that, and I appreciate it too seeing as she allowed herself to be teased like that. With a smile and all the things packed, I bid a hasty retreat with a grin on my face. Besides, the best is yet to come.</p><p>I couldn’t help giggling as I walked back to the boutique. Several ponies along the way gave me suspicious looks as I chuckled and laughed to myself like I had gone mad. Couldn’t help it I just kept imagining what Twilight’s reaction would be tomorrow. She’s always taken immense pride in being Celestia’s student, but she’s never been Luna’s. Which is why I can’t wait to tell her that I spent a whole evening being tutored by and brainstorming with Luna herself. That’ll blow her head off with envy. </p><p>Once she calms down, then I’ll mention the notes and runic diagrams Luna drew herself. </p><p>Oh yeah, definitely looking forward to tomorrow’s session with her.</p>

<p>So this chapter took a bit more time than I thought it would. Had a bit of trouble getting it the way I liked it. </p><p>The initial scene with Inquest and Shining Armor might not push the plot forward, but I wanted to further show you a bit of the &quot;inner&quot; relationships within the Castle. </p><p>As for Luna, well it feels good to write with her again. I realized sometime ago that Luna and Rodney never actual got a somewhat casual time together. </p><p>A bit of sad news however, in the near future (mid March to be precise) I will be leaving to attend a boot camp for 12 weeks. Not the military type but programming. It's called HackReactor and its all about web development and stuff like that. So I'll try to pump out as much chapters before that cause I doubt I'll have much free time. </p><p>Well at least I can consider it a vacation from the pink menace. </p><p><span style="color:#EA80B0;font-size:1.5em">HEY!</span></p>						</aside>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em">Shackles and Friendship</span><br/>Chapter 46 - I dun goofed<br/>Edited by <a href="/user/Aussie+Hard-Dick" rel="nofollow">Aussie Hard-D***</a><br/>Pre-read by <a href="/user/Aussie+Hard-Dick" rel="nofollow">Aussie Hard-D***</a></p><p>AN: You know you’re screwed when you have to censor your editor’s name.</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>“Humanity won a small victory today. We convinced the Ponies that Santa Claus is real.” ~ High Command of the Resistance</p></div><hr/><p>“I must say, I’m rather surprised.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Shine looked at me as we continue making our way to the edge of town. “Well at first I was somewhat worried when you suddenly wanted to visit the school.”</p><p>“And what’s so worrying about that?” I asked, a hint of accusation in my tone. </p><p>“Nothing,” Shine answered, a bit too quickly. “It’s just...well,” she began nervously, “you and young children together in an enclosed room. That just sounds like-”</p><p>“A recipe for total, wanton destruction and chaos?” I interrupted with a serious look before smiling humorously. “It’s alright Shine, you’re not the first to think so. But don’t be surprised if things actually work out, I’m actually somewhat good with children.”</p><p>Shine and I continued on in silence, sometimes greeting or replying to ponies we passed by. The closer to the edge of town we got, the less ponies we saw. Eventually the only sound we heard were the chirping of birds and the light jingling tone  of my chains dancing with my every step. It only took maybe fifteen minutes or so to finally reach the schoolhouse. </p><p>I was confused when I heard that the schoolhouse was located outside of the town perimeter, it’s not that far but it’s still beyond the town’s limits. Thinking about it I came to the conclusion that the school itself was an unexpected variable during Ponyville’s original construction. Perhaps they never expected the town to grow as it did, and realized too late that they needed a dedicated place to educate their kids. </p><p>Whatever their reasons, there’s no doubt that the schoolhouse was beautiful. Rather than a school, it looked more like a small red-ish church with enough space all around for kids to play. They even got a decent sized playground with swings at the back, another strange similarity to my world that I won’t bother questioning. </p><p>“I just realized,” Shine began as we approached the building, “don’t you think we should’ve come by on a non-school day?” Like myself, she must’ve heard the many cheerful voices talking animatedly from inside. </p><p>“Actually, I originally planned on going along with Sweetie Belle, she goes to school and I just wanted to watch for a bit.” I explained. “Mostly to introduce myself to the rest of the kids that I haven’t met. Basically let my presence be as normal to them as possible so they feel comfortable.”</p><p>Shine briefly stared at me with a blank expression. “That’s...a really good idea. Why didn’t you do that then?”</p><p>I shrugged. “I was busy earlier today with an experiment.” The moment I mentioned ‘experiment’ Shine immediately tensed up. </p><p>“Rodney you promised!” she yelled. “No new spells without Twilight!”</p><p>“It’s completely harmless! I promise!” I argued. “It’s a medical spell and before you argue, no I didn’t use it on any living being. I’m not crazy enough to use magic on my own body or anyone else, even on an animal.”</p><p>Shine’s look of disapproval stayed. “Twilight’s going to get angry if she finds out.”</p><p>“The promise was mainly for the sake of dangerous spells, this was not. Now as I was saying, I was experimenting earlier today but I hit a snag. Can’t for the life of me figure out how to fix it. I thought about helping Rarity, but she locked herself in her study room in search of “inspiration”. So I figured I’d at least drop by the schoolhouse and introduce myself to Cheerilee, the teacher.”</p><p>“So you're not actually teaching today?” she asked, still with a frown.</p><p>“Of course not. Cheerilee probably has something planned out and I can’t just drop by and start teaching willy nilly. C’mon Shine give me some credit here, I’ve thought this through.”</p><p>“Alright I’m sorry. I guess I’m still worried about the Princess’s unannounced visit a few days ago. I’ve lived in the castle long enough to know they neither would go away alone like that unless it was a special case.”</p><p>I let out a sigh. “Okay I’ll be honest, Luna showing up like that did have something to do with this. She knew I had interests in teaching and came to remind me.”</p><p>Shine glanced thoughtfully at me. “Is that all she came for?”</p><p>“That’s all I’m willing to say.” I looked at her with a neutral expression. “Everything else is a private matter between me and her.”</p><p>This time it was Shine’s turn to sigh. “Fine I won’t ask anymore. You know I’m just worried about you right?”</p><p>I rolled my eyes. “It’s amazing how similar you are to Twilight in that regard.” Rather than walking up to the schoolhouse door and knocking, I went and sat on the ground and leaned against the building. </p><p>“Aren’t we going in?” Shine asked confused. </p><p>“Later. I can hear that she’s still teaching?” I gestured towards the muffled voices from inside. “From what Sweetie Belle told me, the class will be dismissed for a break in a bit. I’ll introduce myself to Cheerilee then.”</p><p>“I see.” Shine joined and sat next to me on her rump, the both of us staring back at Ponyville in silence. “So what problem were you having?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You said that you hit a problem early today with your experiment. What was it?”</p><p>“Ah, well...”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[At the same time, in Carousel Boutique]=========</p></div><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><p>“Rodney dear? Are you in here?” Rarity opened the door and entered the room. Seeing no sign of the human she looked confused. “Funny, I could’ve sworn I heard somepony in here.” </p><p>Looking around the room a second time, Rarity took in the state of the room and let out a sigh. It wasn’t what most would call messy, in fact most of Sweetie Belle’s possessions and furniture were exactly as they were when Rodney moved in. Unfortunately said items were buried under a large amount of stuff Rodney brought in. </p><p>Most prevalent were the large number of books strewn about. Some lie open on the floor, table and bed while others were stacked atop each other in various places. All no doubt belonging to the library or perhaps Twilight herself. On one side, away from the bed, was a box filled with discarded gemstones Rarity had given permission for Rodney to use in his work, whatever that may be. </p><p>What attracted Rarity’s attention the most however, were the many random assortment of items huddled together at one corner of the room. There were blocks of wood and bits of shavings in the floor along with a few sharp tools like knives. Looking at one particular wood block, Rarity immediately recognized the runes inscribed on them. This was likely where Rodney spent most of his time putting what he learned about runes into practice. Rarity knew that wood was an excellent material to use for practice and training, just one of those random bits of knowledge she picked up when spending time with Twilight. It's really quite impossible for anypony <i>not</i> to learn something from that mare.</p><p>“I’ll have to tell him to clean this up once he returns home,” Rarity told herself. Despite the mess, Rarity felt pleased to see this. It showed her that Rodney was spending his time diligently on something fruitful. “Well then, back to work.”</p><p>Rarity had just about closed the door behind her when her ear twitched when she heard a sound from inside the, supposedly, empty room. She stayed perfectly still, her ears standing up at attention as she strained her senses. Hearing nothing after some time, Rarity blamed the wind and trotted back towards her study. </p><p>Thud. Thud.</p><p>“Now I know I heard that!” Rarity declared, rushing back into the room. Once inside she stood still once again, ears swivelling suspiciously. One minute, two minute, three minute, she continued to wait patiently. </p><p>Thud.</p><p>Her head turned fast towards the simple table with drawer sitting quietly to the far side of the room. There were books laying atop heavy objects blocking the drawer from opening. She approached it tentatively and was about to reach with her hoof when the drawer tried to open itself only to be blocked by pile in front of it. This was the source of the sound that’s been teasing her. She contemplated her next move carefully, on one hoof this is her home, on the other she should respect Rodney’s privacy. </p><p>Thud. Thud.</p><p>To make it worse, whatever was inside the drawer kept on teasing her curiosity. Almost as if it was daring her to open the drawer. </p><p>“Well I can’t work with this annoying me all day.” With that, Rarity reached, pushed the pile of objects out of the way. Using the edge of her hoof, she pulled the drawer open. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Outside Ponyville Schoolhouse]=========</p></div><p>“You’re lying,” Shine declared with a flat expression. </p><p>“I’m not!” I defended. Shine stared at me trying to find any hints of a lie while I confidently locked eyes with her. “It’s real, you’ve seen it before remember?”</p><p>“Yes I’ve seen that flying gem of yours, but what you described seems...I don’t know, impossible.”</p><p>I smiled smugly. “Not impossible, just never been done before. And truth be told, it’s not even original either.” That seemed to confuse Shine. </p><p>“How is something that’s never been done before not original?”</p><p>“Because all I did was take existing spells, break them apart, take what I needed, and stitched them together. You see? Nothing original. Just different.”</p><p>Shine looked at me thoughtfully for a second. “I don’t know, that sounds pretty original to me. Or are you just being modest?”</p><p>I let out a fake dramatic gasp of surprise. “Me? Modest? Oh goodness, maybe I should check myself at the hospital, this could be serious!” With an irritated look Shine struck my shoulder with her hoof which made me laugh. </p><p>“But seriously, back to topic, yes I really did make a gem that can <i>see</i>. Originally the spell I created only latches on to me as both a target and anchor, add a [Levitation] spell and the gem would follow me around. It might look and act as if it can see, but that’s only an illusion.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>AN: For clarity sake, spell names with be referenced with brackets, ie. [‘spell name’]</p></div><p>“And now? It can actually see? As in with eyes?”</p><p>“Of course not! It’s a rock, how can it have eyes?”</p><p>“Then how-”</p><p>“How does a blind pony see?” I asked, hoping to explain it easier. </p><p>“Er, they don’t.”</p><p>“Then how do you give them the ability to see? And I don’t mean with instruments.” Shine thought for a moment but eventually she shook her head, unable to answer. “There was a spell mentioned in a history book that I read. It’s intended to be used for blind ponies. By using their own magic, the spell allows the blind to ‘see’ with magic. Much like how bats use their ears and sound to ‘see’, and the proper term for that ability is echolocation. The creator decided to name the spell [Arcane Vibe].”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘I’ll say it again, it sounds like a sex toy.’</span></p><p>Shine’s eyebrow rose in surprise. “Are you serious? That’s amazing! I may not be a unicorn but it’s still surprising I haven’t heard about that spell before.”</p><p>I frowned. “Wouldn’t be surprised if you didn’t. I tracked down a book that includes detailed accounts and information about the spell. Like I said before, this was a harmless medical spell so don’t worry. The reason it never got popular is due to the low success it has despite it working perfectly.” This really seemed to confuse Shine further. </p><p>“See, the spell depends on two things, the magic of the recipient and their ability to ‘attune’ themselves to the spell. Their magic determines how effective the spell can work, like how far the spell can reach around the recipient. But the hardest part comes after. Even if you had plenty of magic you need to, and I’m quoting here, ‘be able to attune and listen to the spell talk back.’ This apparently takes months of training, and the only ones who managed to successfully use the spell were unicorns. This is probably because unicorns were more accustomed to magic than pegasi and earth ponies. Based on the book, it’s like teaching yourself to see a color or hear a sound that you’ve never seen or heard before.”</p><p>Shine’s expression went from thoughtful to confusion. She probably tried doing it and simply couldn’t understand how that was possible, imagining a sight or sound that you’ve never experience.  </p><p>“Yeah, I don’t know what that last part meant either. Let’s just be grateful both of us ain’t blind.” Shine agreed with a nod. “But in any case, I took that spell and, with some creative fine tuning from yours truly,” I saw Shine roll her eyes, “I made it workable for my gem. Unlike ponies, the gem works off the spell itself, which means it has no problem ‘listening’ to the feedback. So now, using the magic stored inside, it would ‘see’ by expanding a small amount of magic around itself.”</p><p>I let out a long frustrated sigh. “And that’s where my problem lies.” </p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well...”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Carousel Boutique]=========</p></div><p>Rarity dove to the floor in fright as the flaming rock continue to wreak destruction above. She quickly crawled her way under the table seeking shelter while she witnessed the gemstone crash into walls creating dents like a fly to a window. Worse it was also knocking things off creating a mess. Papers and diagrams were flying, furniture breaking and toppling over. </p><p>It’s as if the flaming gemstone was the embodiment of Sweetie Belle’s passive destructive nature in its perfect form. </p><p>She heard the sound of glass shattering before all seemed to quiet down. Rarity poked her head from under the table and saw the room clear of the infernal stone. Unfortunately the peaceful silence was disrupted when she heard several voices yelling in fright from outside. </p><p>“What is that thing!?”</p><p>“My lunch!”</p><p>“That’s Rodney’s fire thingy!”</p><p>“Someone call Twilight!”</p><p>“That thing hit me! Am I on fire!?”</p><p>Turning towards the window, her suspicions were confirmed at seeing the large hole in the wall where a window use to be. Quickly looking out, she saw the many ponies outside running for cover much like she did as the flaming gemstone started to cause chaos upon Ponyville. </p><p>“Oh dear,” Rarity softly mumbled quietly. It was all she could say. </p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Ponyville Schoolhouse]=========</p></div><p>“I don’t get it. If the [Arcane Vibe] spell allows the gem to see, why is it flying blind and hitting things?”</p><p>“Because being able to see and having the intelligence to <i>not</i> hit things are two completely different and separate points,” I explained with a sigh, frustrated at my inability to fix the problem. “I actually already have an idea on how to go about fixing it. Unfortunately it won’t work because of the layering.”</p><p>“The ‘layering’?” Shine asked. </p><p>I nodded. “It’s the term when you apply a spell over a pre-existing one, whether it be an active, passive, or hybrid type. Basically, you can easily stack simple spells on top of each other and they’ll work just fine, so long as each spell doesn’t contradict or disrupt one another. Though there is still a limit. Unfortunately the [Arcane Vibe] spell is a very complicated and large spell. So much so that even a spell as simple as [Levitation] layered on top is going crazy. Had everything worked as it should, the gem would’ve just stayed still in the air since it has no other commands to carry out.”</p><p>“And that’s why the gemstone’s gone crazy?” Shine deduced. </p><p>I breathed in and let out a long sigh. “Yup. the layering problem is causing the [Levitation] spell to go batshit crazy. I spent all night reading and trying to fix the problem but no luck so far.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you just go back to the original way then? Sound like this shouldn’t be a problem when you had it working before.”</p><p>I thought for a moment, thinking how to best explain it so Shine would understand. “If I wanted the gem to follow me or someone and do only that, then you’re right. But it’s all about establishing a flexible groundwork.” I paused to let that sink in. “See, if I could actually make the gem ‘see’, then the next step would be to give it a form of ‘recognition’. With those two features alone, it would be possible for the gem to actually know who is who. I could make it find someone, deliver messages, and so forth. If a kid goes missing and I had someway to store an ‘image’ of said child, I could send out hundreds of gems to go look for whoever based on that image.”</p><p>Shine stared at the ground, pondering my words.</p><p>“You see? With just two basic features, ‘sight’ and ‘recognition’, the potential of my work multiplies several times. Dare I say, limitless?” The last part I spoke with a bit of flair. “Now do you understand why I’m putting so much work on something so simple? It’s for potential.” </p><p>“Well don’t worry. If you’re stuck I’m sure Twilight can figure it out, she’s Princess Celestia’s student after all.”</p><p>I rolled my eyes. “Well gee, thanks. You sure know how to motivate someone,” I replied sarcastically. </p><p>“Happy to help,” Shine replied back with a teasing smile. “So how long until you can get another one working?”</p><p>“What do you mean another one?” I asked with a raised brow. </p><p>“Well you have to make another one. You have to keep making new ones to experiment right?” I tried my best to keep my face frozen, but something must’ve twitched cause Shine’s expression drastically changed. “Rodney, you did cancel the spell on the gemstone, right?”</p><p>I hesitated to answer, and that was all Shine needed to confirm her suspicion.</p><p>“You didn’t!?” she both asked and declared. “Why? From what you told me that gem sounds dangerous!”</p><p>“Look,” I began to explain, “as I mentioned before the [Arcane Vibe] spell is huge and complicated, plus it’s a modified version. It took me hours after many failures to get it to work the way I wanted it to. I didn’t want to go through all that again. Besides it’s not <i>that</i> dangerous, at the most it’ll just cause a slight bruise if it hits you. It’s more of an annoyance with the mess it makes.”</p><p>Shine took a deep breath to calm herself before asking, with a hint of threat in her tone. “Rodney, where is the gem right now?”</p><p>“Safe,” I answered confidently. </p><p>Before Shine could ask further questions, the large bell above the schoolhouse rang low and long followed by the clamour of excited voices and small hoofsteps, indicating the break I’ve been waiting for. “Welp, time to go introduce myself,” glad to of the timing.</p><p>I could feel Shine’s gaze drilling at the back of my head as I turned and knocked loudly on the front door, no doubt she’ll bring this up later after I’m done. </p><p>Rather than seeing an adult pony, the door opened revealing a young gray colored pegasus that I didn’t recognize. Likely just one of the many children in town that I haven’t met, or perhaps I did and simply forgot. </p><p>“Hey kid,” I greeted casually, “mind telling Cheerilee she’s got company?”</p><p>“I’m not a kid,” the young colt corrected, looking slightly peeved at being called such. I immediately discerned his character to be the type that, either thinks his old enough for everything, or wished to grow up quicker. </p><p>“My name’s Rumble,” he continued with childlike confidence, “and it’s <i>Miss</i>Cheerilee. And no, I don’t mind telling her.” He stayed there, unmoving with a grin on his face. </p><p>I rolled my eyes. “<i>Will</i> you please inform <i>Miss</i> Cheerilee she has company?” I clarified.</p><p>“Sure.” With that grin still plastered on his face he turned and trotted inside leaving Shine and I waiting by the open door. </p><p>It took several minutes for Cheerilee to show up. If I had to guess she was probably busy with a kid or two who needed her attention. </p><p>“Mr.Rodney,” Cheerilee greeted...well, cheerfully. It’s not surprising that she knew my name, not because of Sweetie Belle, but because after everything that has happened, I’ve become something of common knowledge. “And…”</p><p>“Ah, this is Shine Bright”, I informed, stepping to the side so Cheerilee could see better. “She’s here to make sure I don’t blow up the kids.” I received an irritated poke for that, even though it was partially true.</p><p>Cheerilee giggled. “I’m certain we’ll all make it through the day. Now what can I help you with?”</p><p>“Actually, I was hoping it’ll be the otherway around.” Cheerilee raised a brow. “If it’s at all possible, I would like to take on a teaching position.” Both her eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Nothing big,” I clarified, “something more like a assistance position.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to say but I don’t think that’ll work.” Cheerilee continued to explain before I could argue. “Not that I don’t appreciate it, it’s just that their only foals. Meaning the teaching material isn’t that complicated at all. Rather, having somepony the children aren’t familiar with suddenly showing up to teach would-”</p><p>“Do more harm than good,” I finished with a calm smile. “Don’t worry, this request isn’t something I haven’t considered in great detail. For now it’s enough that you know of my intent. I’m hoping in the future I’ll drop by time to time and let the kids familiarize with me.”</p><p>Cheerilee paused for a moment, giving my offer a bit more thought than before. “I can see how that would help, but to be frank, I just don’t need the help. As I’ve said the teaching material is very basic.”</p><p>I nodded to her. “Yes I know. I realized that after helping Sweetie Belle with some of her homework.”</p><p>“Ah, I have noticed her results improving,” Cheerilee commented. </p><p>“Glad to hear my efforts aren’t wasted then. But back to my point, even though I offer to help teach, I’m hoping to be a student myself.” Cheerilee tilted her head to the side with a confused expression. “Think of me as a far away traveler new to Equestria, by helping you I aim to learn many of the nuances of Equestrian lifestyle I may be ignorant of.”</p><p>“Well in that case you’re more than welcome to just join the class.” I heard Shine snort as she tried to stifle her laughter. She probably imagined me sitting in one of her class surrounded by foals. </p><p>“That might be true,” I said ignoring Shine, “but I’d like to offer something in return as well. But please, you don’t have to make that decision now. Like I said I’ll drop by till the kids feel comfortable with my presence, till then you can mull this over and we can discuss further after.”</p><p>“I can agree to that,” Cheerilee agreed, looking relieved that she had time to properly evaluate my offer. “Would you like to see the children now? At the very least you could help me keep an eye on them as they play.”</p><p>“Gladly, I’m sure Shine wouldn’t mind helping as well,” I said pointing my thumb over my shoulder at the mare behind me. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said teasingly. “It’s hard enough keeping one foal from causing trouble.”</p><p>“Ha. Ha. Ha. Very funny,” I replied with heavy sarcasm. </p><p>“Come this way.” Cheerilee lead the way with a smile, humoured by our banter.</p><p>I was quite surprised at how simple the inside of the school was. There was only a single large class that made up most of the building, the rest divided between hallways and basic facilities like bathrooms. Thanks to its size, the classroom had plenty of room for many drawers and bookshelves that line themselves up against the wall. I saw a simple telescope, a globe, plenty for arts and crafts, and the usual stuff you’d expect to see in a preschool classroom. </p><p>We came across a few kids along the way, they looked confused at first but seeing Cheerilee nearby seemed to eradicate any suspicion. It didn’t take long before a few were following us out of curiosity. The same grey pegasus from before, Rumble, having already interacted with me at the door, had no problem trotting up next to me while trying to strike a casual conversation. If I had to guess, he’s probably trying to show off his bravery by approaching me so casually. </p><p>“Rodney?” was the first thing I heard as we exited to the playground. I saw Applebloom nudged Sweets and Scoots turning their attention to me. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Scoots asked as the Crusader trio approached me. </p><p>“Aw c’mon Scoots,” I cooed teasingly. “Do I need a reason to see my favorite little Crusader?”</p><p>“What about me?” Sweets asked with a small frown.</p><p>“Come now Sweets, you know you’re already special.” I felt Applebloom tug my left chain. “You too Bloom.”</p><p>“Oh it’s Rodney!”</p><p>“Ah cool!”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Ergh, those two.’</span></p><p>Leading the rush of foals, were two colts who I’ve tried to avoid when I could. Not saying that I dislike them or anything like that, after all they’re just children. It’s just...they can really test your patience. </p><p>“Snips, Snail,” I greeted, trying not to sigh at the same time. “I’m still not going to blow things up for you.”</p><p>“Ah cmon!” Snips begged. “You did it once.”</p><p>“By accident because you two ambushed me,” I argued. Long story short they forced me to throw a fireball, I made sure the two of them got the blame for the mess. “I hope you two aren’t planning anything else for all our sake.”</p><p>“Of course not,” Snips ensured.</p><p>“....We aren’t?” Snails questioned. Snips face hoofed as he grumbled and glared at Snails. I merely rolled my eyes. </p><p>Then I heard a voice talk in a very haughty tone. “You don’t look like much.” </p><p>As I turned towards the voice I heard the Crusader groan in annoyance. Sweetie Belle had spent plenty of time venting and complaining about this particular filly at home. I’ve heard enough to recognize her, not from visual description, rather from the way she carried herself. </p><p>Diamond Tiara, a spoiled brat who thinks the world should worships her.</p><p>I crossed my arms as she trotted around me, inspecting me up and down. I felt her poke and prod at me with the tip of her hoof. Eventually she stood in front of me, looking up unflinching despite our difference in height. </p><p>She then declared, as if it were a fact of the world, “You couldn’t have fought a dragon. I think you lied to everypony.”</p><p>I will admit, though I’m not proud, I felt a small temptation to squeeze her head in between my knuckles and twist. </p><p>“Now Tiara,” Cheerilee warned in a teacher’s tone, “what did we learn about being polite.”</p><p>“But Miss Cheerilee, you also taught us not to accept the word of other ponies by face value,” Tiara argued back. “Just because everypony says this hairless monkey-”</p><p>That temptation grew several times bigger.</p><p>“-fought a dragon. I mean look at him Miss Cheerilee,” Tiara gestured up and down at me, “how is he supposed to have survived a dragon let alone fight one.”  </p><p>“Well he did!” Sweetie Belle yelled in anger. “I saw him charge right at the dragon! Even the newspaper said he did. Just because you’re not a wikness-”</p><p>“Witness,” I corrected.</p><p>“Witness, doesn’t mean it’s not true.” To be honest, I wouldn’t have likely believed it myself if I were in Tiara’s position. Just imagine it, even if I were some hardened Rambo-like soldier, facing a dragon and living is a hard pill to swallow. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#6495ED">‘Let’s just light her on fire like we did Blue Blood.’</span></p><p>Ignoring that horrible idea, I kneeled and raised an open hand to Tiara. She looked at it, expected something in my hand. Seeing it empty she frowned and looked at me disapprovingly, as if I was about to gift her something. before she could say anything, I gathered a somewhat larger than normal amount of magic in my arm, and pushed them all at once to the palm of my hand. The effect was...explosive, all the puns intended. </p><p>I smiled seeing Tiara fall back startled as a giant pyro of blue flames burst and rose roughly half a meter high. It looked like I was hold onto a small bonfire. </p><p>You probably thought this was a bad idea, exposing my flames to children in front of their teacher, but I was betting on the fact that my unique magic had become common knowledge in town. Sure enough neither Shine nor Cheerile acted to stop me, though Cheerilee did frown ever so slightly at having her student being scared like that. </p><p>“First of all,” I said casually, crouching down to Tiara, “I’m not a monkey. Second, even though you’re not a unicorn, you should know never to underestimate what magic can do.” I probably should mention, as I did in the interview with Quill Stride, that I didn’t actually fight Falnor. Luna finished that battle for me.</p><p>With my attention at Tiara, I barely noticed all the kids had their eyes glued at my magic still in my open palm. Except for Sweetie Belle who has seen it plenty of times, the others were wrapped with curiosity. One filly who I wasn’t familiar with, actually held out her small hoof expecting to feel heat like a normal fire would make. </p><p>“No it doesn’t burn,” I informed her, causing her to pull back her hoof and look away. “You can touch it if you want.” I syphoned a large portion back making the fire shrink into a less intimidating size before slowly moving my hand towards her. </p><p>An step I knew to help kids get comfortable around strangers, have them completely attracted and wondering about something you have. Be it a new toy, technology, whatever. Most of them had either heard about or seen my magic, seeing how I would sometime use them in public. But only Sweetie Belle has ever actually gotten close and interacted with it. </p><p>And I know what you’re all thinking, what the hell am I doing exposing them to what could easily be considered an explosive substance? Had I been here a week ago, I would probably have agreed with you. Although I’m still clueless as to the reasons behind it, I left Twilight in charge of figuring that out, we managed to discern ‘rules’ that my magic follows. </p><p>To put it simply, only in a raw state would my magic explode. Should I weave it into a spell and cast it, the magic would create the effect of the spell as normal magic would. However, in the event that after my spell is finished and there remains unused magic, it would explode. Similarly, should my spell break apart or fail before it’s done, the remaining magic would also explode. </p><p>Even in a raw state, as the magic in my hand is currently at, so long as I am in control the explosive nature stays inert. And it actually doesn’t take much, in most cases I simply have to be aware that it’s there to keep it from exploding. Although there are limits, like distance. </p><p>Twilight and I have accepted this as a hard fact, an unbreakable law that my magic obeys completely. Like amature chefs, they might be fearful of fire at first, but the more you work with it and understand it, you learn to conquer it. Which is why I was much more confident in handling my magic than before, where I were obsessed with not blowing myself up by accident before. </p><p>The filly looked hesitantly to the flames, then to me who gave her an affirming nod, and back to the flames. She reached out slowly, the others watch holding their breaths as her small hoof reached closer and closer. She let out a cute “Eep!” as her hoof got licked by a small string of fire. Seeing herself unhurt, she reached out again, a bit more confidently until the tip went in. Then, with surprisingly, she went gung-ho and immersed her entire hoof to the palm of my hand, my magic burning around her hoof as if she was fire-proof.</p><p>She pulled her hoof back, held it and twisted for her to inspect before looking at me and loudly declared. “That’s so cool!”</p><p>And just like that, the dam broke. All the foals around started sticking their hoofs at the fire, completely forgetting I was mostly just a stranger to them only a moment ago.</p><p>As far as first visits go, I’d consider this a massive success. They’ll be far less intimidated and hesitant to be around me next time I visit. If this continues, I expect it’ll only take a few more visits, probably three or four, before they’re completely comfortable with me. </p><p>I felt someone tug my shirt from the back, turning I saw Diamond Tiara and another filly. “Can I touch too?” she asked, swallowing her pride for the sake of curiosity. Children will be children I guess. Still, a lesson needed to be taught. </p><p>“I think I deserve an apology first,” I said, trying hard not to smile smugly. </p><p>Tiara’s expressions flared angrily and was likely about to throw some insult or something until I moved my hand and teased the mystical looking fire in front of her. </p><p>Her mouth opened and closed more than a few times. Shows how much she’s not used to apologizing. “I...I’m...sorry. There, I said it,” she said irritably. </p><p>Not hiding my smile, I moved my hand closer and let her sink her hoof into the fire. </p><hr/><p>“Well this is certainly surprising,” Cheerilee commented as she and Shine watched the human interact with the foals. “I didn’t expect the children to approach him so easily.”</p><p>“I know,” Shine agreed, just as surprised. “He’s literally got them eating out of his hoof-er, hands.”</p><p>Both of them continued to watch slightly awed at the sight before Cheerilee spoke again. “What’s your opinion on this? Should I let him teach?”</p><p>Shine thought for a moment. “Well I doubt he’ll have a problem with the material. I’m more worried about his behaviour.” Cheerilee’s ear twitched at this as she looked at Shine to elaborate. “Nothing dangerous. In fact Rodney has a likable personality, easy going. Perhaps a bit too care free, but I suppose that’s part of his charm.”</p><p>“Then what are you worried about?”</p><p>Shine let out a sigh. “It’s hard to say. He would never purposefully cause harm to anypony, however he doesn’t always think his actions through. He might intend to teach proper lessons, but the children might imitate his behaviour and-”</p><p>Shine stopped speaking as Cheerilee started to giggle. “Oh Shine, if that was the case I don’t think anypony is qualified to teach. Nopony is perfect, though I try, sometimes I say one thing but do something different. Rarely, but it happens. The real lesson I try to teach is for everypony to try.” </p><p>She turned her attention back to the human, now busy lifting Applebloom up as she sat behind his neck. The other children were yelling excitedly for their turn. “They certainly are enjoying his company.”</p><p>“I think that’s because they instinctively know he’s one of them,” Shine explained with a smile. Cheerilee looked at her quizzically. “He’s not showing it right now, but most of the time he acts like the foals around him.”</p><p>Making the connection Cheerilee giggled humorously. “I supposed that’s one way of seeing it.”</p><p>The bell rang once again, signalling lessons to begin again. </p><p>“Alright children that’s enough. Time to go back inside.” She was assaulted with moans, a few argued they hadn’t had a turn riding on Rodney. “I’m sure we’ll be seeing more of Mr. Rodney.” She looked at the human. “Won’t we?”</p><p>Getting the message that he was welcome to visit, he smiled happily. “Of course. Why wouldn’t I?” He picked the colt riding on him off and settled him gently on the ground. “Don’t worry guys, I promise you’ll all get a ride.” He turned to Diamond Tiara. “Unless you don’t behave.”</p><p>Tiara huffed and turned around before trotting towards the schoolhouse, head held high followed by Silver Spoon. </p><p>“Alright everypony,” Cheerilee called out. “Make sure to say goodbye to Mr.Rodney before heading back inside.” Once the last foal went inside, Cheerilee approached Rodney. “I haven’t decided, but you’re welcome to drop by next week. It’s best we give the children sometime before your next visit.”</p><p>“Not sure why but, seeing as you know best I’ll listen. I suppose this is goodbye then, see you next week.”</p><p>“Mr.Rodney, Miss Shine, till next week.” With that Cheerilee went inside the schoolhouse leaving the human and mare alone. </p><p>“Well let’s head back then.”</p><div class="bbcode-center" style="text-align:center"><p>=========[Sometime later, Ponyville]=========</p></div><p>“...”</p><p>“......Rodney.”</p><p>I reached up and face palmed. “Shine, don’t. I can see it clearly.”</p><p>“What was it you said before? Safe?”</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath and sighed heavily as signs of a headache started to form. There in the distance, at a four way street, ponies were gathered in a large circle. The area around were littered with varying items, from broken glass to fruits of vegetables knocked over from their stalls. In the center was a small clearing, hovering right above the center of that clearing was a very familiar gemstone. It was an uncut, deformed onyx roughly the size of a grapefruit. </p><p>Blazing with blue fire, it hovered above the ground, caught in what looked like a fishing net. How anyone has a fishing net when the town was smack in the middle of the continent was beyond me. Ropes attached to the net were held down by ponies, biting as they pulled in all direction forcing the net and gem trapped in the middle. A few were working on nailing down these ropes to the ground. Despite all this the onyx could still be seen tugging slightly in random directions, trying to escape. </p><p>Just outside the crowd facing towards us was Twilight, and boy she looked absolutely pissed. Being the inquisitive and genius pony she was, Twilight no doubt analyzed enough of the spell on the gem to know I had broken my promise. Which explained why she not only looked extremely angry, but disappointed as well. I felt guilty. </p><p>“So….what are you going to tell her?” Shine asked. </p><p>“The truth,” I sighed. </p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“I dun goofed.”</p>
