<p>As my body slowly woke up I immediately noticed something wrong. It was too dark. I always left the closet light on. And crinkly. Since when did my bed crinkle? I rolled around and moved my arm to brush the crinkly stuff from under my back. Or I tried to. I grimaced as my arm didn’t listen to me. <i>Come on, just move</i> I encouraged my arm. It still wouldn’t move. I groaned as I opened my eyes to see what was keeping my arm from moving. What I saw surprised me greatly.</p><p>I wasn’t in my house anymore. <i>Ooooooooh my goooooood.</i> I frantically whipped my head around, trying to find out where I was. It was when my head continued past the point it was supposed for the fourth time that I noticed. And it did nothing to alleviate my panic. I carefully turned my head as far as it would go to the right. Then the left. Turns out I could turn my head all the way backwards now...and look at my not human back. My back was covered in....space? <i>No, not space. Feathers....that look like space?</i> I noticed something sticking out between my eyes where my nose should be. Crossing my eyes I discovered it was a beak. A pitch black hawk beak. On my face. I faced forwards and looked down. Scared to find anything else wrong, but unable to stop looking. My front was covered in space feathers as well. <i>it looks like a window into space</i> I though as I stared intently at my chest.</p><p>As I watched, a shooting star shot across my feathers. Too frozen with disbelief to react, I tracked the star across my body. Across my chest and down my wing. I opened my wing to watch as the trail of space dust reached the tip of my wing and came back up the underside. <i>Wing?</i> looking even further down my body revealed pitch black talons with wickedly sharp nails.</p><p>A pine cone landed on the leaf cover ground next to me. Startled, I took note of my surroundings. I was in a dark forest filled with giant trees. <i>No, not giant. Normal sized. I’m just small.</i> Moonlight shown through the canopy in silvery streams that barely lit up the ground. Yet I could see fine.</p><p>My wings ruffled in agitation. I glanced at them before looking back up into the trees. <i>I swore I saw someth- There!</i> A flash of green drew my attention. I narrowed my eyes at the spot I saw it. Suddenly two green dots appeared in front of me. Just floating there. <i>What is tha-?</i> Teeth filled my Vision as something leapt from the trees. “KEEEEEEEEEAR!!!” I shrieked in surprise. Luckily, the wooden wolf in front of me surprised me more than the sound that escaped my beak. The wooden beast snarled at me from where it landed. “Tseee!!” I tried to yell in fear. However, all I got was bird noises. The wolf lunged once more and I cowered on the ground. All I could focus on were the giant teeth headed my way. The needle sharp, saliva dripping maw coming to consume me. And coming. And coming. And.....<i>im not dead?</i> Hearing whimpering I looked out from under my wing. All I saw was the tail of the beast running into the woods. ‘HAH!! Yeah, get outta here!!’ Was what I tried to yell at it. Instead what came out was “KEEEEAR!!!”</p><p>As the Adrenaline left my body my head sagged. It slowly drifted down to look at my chest. “KEEEEEEAR” I shrieked yet again. Instead of space feathers I was greeted by rows upon rows upon rows of teeth fading into a dark abyss. I threw my head under my wing only to see a hateful glowing green eye. That was the last thing I saw before I passed out.</p><hr/><p>Waking up for the second time was better than the first. Firstly, it was morning. The forest was much less unsettling in the day. Secondly, I could think clearer. Any doubt of this being real was removed. And my mind was putting together pieces I didn’t even know existed. <i>That was a Timber Wolf last night! But those aren’t real. I must be dreaming but I’m not. The only explanation is to insane to accept.</i> Deciding to focus on something else, I tried to replicate what I did last night. Somehow I had scared off that Timberwolf. And by gosh I needed every strength I could get right now. So I walked in a random direction while staring at my wings.</p><p>Hours past as I tried to change even a single death on my wings. To be honest, it was frustrating. To the point I was seeing red. <i>Come on!! Just change ONE feather!! ONE!!!!</i> Some bushes nearby rustled. I immediately thought of another timberwolf lying in wait. Panic flashed through me. <i>Dont see me!! Please! Why can’t I be something more subtle than a giant space hawk!?</i> The bushes rustled more. And a rabbit jumped out. It looked around for a second before running off. Feeling like an idiot, I continued walking. Only to stop when I looked at my wings. They were wooden. Or they looked wooden anyways. In fact, the space theme I had going was replaced completely by tree bark. The feathers faded back to normal as I watched them intently. Once the where normal again I looked at a single feather and thought hard about the color blue. Amazingly it changed. One bright blue feather in the middle of space. All the hours of shouting magic words when the technique had been much simpler.</p><p>My stomach growled all of a sudden. And I stared in the direction the rabbit ran in. I was hungry. And as much as I hated to admit it, that rabbit looked delicious. Focused on my feathers and they all changed. Starting at the base of each feather and working up to the tips. I was wooden once again. I quickly left after the rabbit.</p><hr/><p>I saw my target. Mere feet away. I slowly crept up on it as it nibbles on grass. It didn’t notice me as I got right behind it. Once close enough I lunged forward and sank my sharp beak into the rabbits neck. It didn’t even know what hit it. I stared down at my kill before leaning down to eat it. Only to stop when I noticed something odd. The rabbit was had bad frost bite where the bite mark was. <i>Did I do that?</i> The skin around the bite was black, but everywhere else was fine. I hesitantly took a bite of the black spot. It was very cold. But it didn’t seem to bother me in the slightest. It tasted fine. Diving in, I gorged myself. I noticed that it didn’t turn black when I bit it anymore. <i>Maybe it’s only when I try to hurt something?</i></p><p>The bushes nearby rustled and I camouflaged myself without a second thought. I stood still waiting to see what came out. There wasn’t much of the rabbit left, but I didn’t want to abandon it for nothing. To my surprise, a little.......pony came out My heart dropped at the sight. <i>Well. That just confirms it. I’m in equestria.</i> What struck me odd was the fact that this pony had a horn and wings. And was smaller than me by a good bit. <i>How big am I?</i> I wondered. This was obviously a filly. And it looked familiar. I just couldn’t put my....talon on it. Why did it look so famil-<i>Woona?</i> That was baby Luna!!</p>

<p>The filly looked around the clearing. Not seeing anything, her eyes teared up. She sniffled and sat on the ground looking totally lost. <i>But. Am I before the show? Before everything?</i> I watched as she began to cry. <i>Oh that’s awful. Don’t cryyyy.</i> She started to sob in front of me. <i>Uuuuuh. What do I do!?</i> I was on an alien planet with a child crying in front of me. Never expected that. I awkwardly walked over and stood beside her. I cocked my head and stared, wondering what I should do. Coming to a decision, I returned my feathers to normal and gently set a wing over her back.</p><p>“Tia!?” She asked in a high voice as she looked up. Seeing a giant hawk didn’t sit well with her. “Aaaah! Tia, save me!!” She yelled into the forest as she cowered on the ground. I looked around expecting another pony to jump out and start attacking me. When none came I got confused. Was she alone?</p><p>“Chirp?” I chirped as I lay my wing across her as gently as I could. She slowly uncurled when I did that.</p><p>“Your not going to eat me?” I shook my head slowly. “Can you help me find m sister?” I cocked my head to the side, once again confused. “I wandered off. And got lost.” She said, embarrassed. “I’m gunna be in so much trouble.”</p><p>“Chirp!” I looked around then took to the skies, eager to help the poor filly find her sister. I had just lost my brother after all. And my family. The thought nearly sent me to the ground, but I punched it aside and climbed higher. Once I was pretty high in the sky I started circling. Not once did I question my sudden ability to fly. Nope. Not once.</p><p>After circling for about 10 minutes, periodically checking on Luna every once in awhile, I spotted two ponies going through the forest not far away. They appeared to be searching frantically. One was unmistakably a young Celestia. The other I wasn’t sure about. He had a beard and pointy hat on. “KEEEEEEEAR” I shrieked as I dove back down to Luna. Once I landed she looked excitedly at me. “Did you find them!?” I nodded rapidly. Then I looked in the direction I saw them, trying to decide how to go about getting her back to them. I came to the conclusion that carrying her would be the fastest way.</p><p>Hovering over to her, I slowly lined my self up to pick her up. She looked with a mystified expression. Until I picked her up. Then she giggled. “Haha! That tickles!” I smiled to my self as I took off through the trees. Weaving through the forest and between branches with agility I never knew I had. Trees flew by as little Luna giggled in my claws. Wind blew past us as we raced towards her family. After a few minutes I started hearing voices through the trees.</p><p>“Luna!!”</p><p>“LULU!!! Where are you!!” I raced towards the voices, quickly a rriving behind the ponies. </p><p>“Chirp” I set Luna down as the ponies spun around. Luna ran to hug Celestia while the bearded pony lit his horn up. And shot at me!! “KEEEEEAR” I shrieked at him as I dodged the glowing blue energy beam.</p><p>“Wait!” Luna yelled. “He helped me!!”</p><p>“What!? Luna it’s a...hawk?” The bearded pony started, seeming to notice how I looked for the first time.</p><p>“What is it Starswirl?” Asked Celestia. I nearly hit the ground. <i>STARSWIRL!?</i></p><p>“I’m not sure Tia. Some kind of magical creature that I have never seen before.” He stared at me intently before approaching. I nervously landed, not wanting another beam hurled at me. I liked living. “It appears to be remarkably intelligent for an avian.” Swirl noted. Yeah, Starswirl is to long. I’m going to call him Swirl. “How did you find him Luna?”</p><p>“I didn’t. He found me. I’m not sure where he came from. One minute I was alone. And then he just popped up beside me.” Luna answered. Right, I had been disguised when she came out. The bushes nearby rustled and I flinched and turned tree like again.</p><p>“Amazing!” Swirl exclaimed as a squirrel ran out of the bushes. “Incredible! Each feather is capable of an advanced illusion spell!!” He excitedly danced around me, lifting my wings and feet. “It seems the only parts not effected are his talons, beak, and eyes.” I blinked, feeling quite uncomfortable. “No, it seems even the eyelid has feathers on it. This is incredible, I have never seen a species like this before!!”</p><p>“Caaaaw!” I exclaimed as he got a little to close to my face.</p><p>“Starswirl, as much as I love your lectures, we really should continue towards Skytown.” Celestia stated. “We’ve already lost enough time as it is.”</p><p>“Your right Tia. As much as I would love to study this creature we must be on our way. Fare the well.” He said to me before he and Tia turns away and started walking into the forest. Luna stared at me for a bit with sad eyes before Swirl called her. “Come along Luna, Skytown won’t stay this close for long.” With that she turned and ran into the woods away from me.</p><p>I sat there for awhile wondering what I was supposed to do now. I didn’t know how to get home. And I didnt really have anything I had to do. Was wandering around really the answer? Most likely not. I decided to do the most reasonable thing. I quickly took off and pushed myself above the trees. Once high enough, I turned in the direction the ponies went. Realizing I would be seen easily at this height, I focused on the sky and turned my feathers sky blue. A few of them even had wispy clouds moving across them.</p><p>Soon enough I caught up to the ponies and stopped flapping my wings. I watched them from above as I glided through the sky, only flapping my wings occasionally. I didn’t know what this ‘Skytown’ was. But my best bet to get home was to stick with the pony wizard.</p>

<p>Following three ponies through the woods for hours wasn’t as boring as you’d think. I got to learn how good my new bird eyes were. I could see for MILES! And I got to watch Luna do adorable things to her sister. Like jump on her back and act out plays. Or pounce on frogs and crickets. I realized the Tia was probably older than Luna by a good bit. Judging by how she calmly walked alongside Swirl and discussed things I couldn’t hear with him, she was a teenager already. Luna acted like she was still five or six. I also realized that Swirl was the same size as Celestia. <i>She must still be growing.</i></p><p>I wasn’t sure where we were headed, but they had been walking for hours. Every once in awhile I swore Luna looked right at me. But I knew that wasn’t possible. Swirl seemed to know where they where going, and occasionally his horn would light and he would adjust his direction slightly. It was after hours of this that I finally saw something. A white blob on the horizon slowly appeared. As we traveled in that direction it slowly got bigger. <i>What is that?</i> After a few hours it was close enough to make out. <i>Oh. My. Gosh.</i> It was a huge city in the clouds. Huge. Bigger than Cloudsdale in the show. It was probably 5 miles across. It was a giant circle of clouds that took up a good portion of the horizon as we got closer. I was so distracted by the beautiful sight that I almost missed the trio I was following stop.</p><p>I ground to a halt and hovered as they did...something. Swirl lit up his horn and shot a beam at the sisters one at a time. They were enveloped in magic for a moment before it faded. When it disappeared they were hornless. They looked like ordinary Pegasi. Strangely, Starswirl didn’t change himself. His horn lit up, along with his body, before fading to normal. The Tia picked him up and started flying up to the city. Luna looked <b>right at me</b> before following her sister. I followed as closely as I could but it was hard once they got in the city. Luckily, Tia’s pink mane made it slightly easier.</p><p><i>Where are they going?</i> I asked myself. Weaving between buildings was get harder and harder the further we went. They were about a mile from the edge now, and it was already getting crowded. Swirl must have cast a cloud walking spell on himself. He seemed almost used to the crowds. And he wasn’t the only unicorn up here. Though few and far between there were other unicorns on the clouds. He barely even got glances from the pegasi around us. I didn’t get any luckily. I doubt I would be very welcome.</p><p>It seemed I was about the same size as the adults around us. I noticed when one flew uncomfortably close to me. I don’t think the other ponies would like me as much as Swirly.</p><p><i>Look at all the stuff up here!</i> Vendors lined the street selling all kinds of Knick knacks. I was tempted to stop a few times and look but I had more important things to take care of. Following the trio around a corner, I saw Starswirl duck into a building with the sisters behind him. I hovered in place while I figured out what to do. Looking around, I dove down to a window sill. I changed my feathers to look like a dark window and landed on the ledge. I listened carefully for where the ponies went and heard voices from the second floor. I flew up to that window sill and once again landed. I heard Swirl discussing something with some pony I didn’t know.</p><p>“Are you sure you can’t help us? Your special talent is tracking!” Swirl said.</p><p>“Sorry, but I can’t help you this time Star. I have plans with family and no time for some crazy adventure.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m sure”</p><p>“Alright.” Starswirl sighed. “We’ll just find our own way then.” With that I heard hoof steps going towards down stairs and towards the door. I took off and made my body look like the sky once more. Luna, Tia, and Swirl walked out and started towards the edge of the city. I followed closely, though I stayed far above this time. It was to stressful navigating the city from street level.</p><p>Once they reached the edge, Tia once again carried Swirl. Luna followed them to the ground. Once there they walked away from the city in the opposite direction than they arrived in. Based on the position of the sun we were headed west. After a few hours they stopped and laid down. Despite gliding most of the way, I to was tired. I dove quickly into the branches above them and changed to look like I was made of leaves. Only my beak and talons were undisguised. I rested on a branch not far above them. “I can’t believe it” Swirl said, frustrated. “He would have helped tremendously.”</p><p>“It’s ok Starswirl. We’ll find it. Then we can be rid of it and move on with our lives.”</p><p>“Yeah! Besides, I’m sure mister hawk can help us! Right!?” She asked as she looked up at me. <i>What!?</i></p><p>“Caaaw!” I choked as I fell out of the tree and hit the ground. <i>Ow.</i> Tia and Swirl looked very surprised when I hit the ground. Momentarily dazed, my feathers returned to the spacey background they seemed to love.</p><p>“Ooh, pretty!” Luna cooed as she ran up and tackled me. My eyes refocused as she snuggled into my chest.</p><p>“Where you following us the whole time?” Tia asked. I nodded slowly, having a slightly harder time breathing with a filly on my chest.</p><p>“Amazing” Starswirl whispered. “How smart are you?” I shrugged, not really knowing how to answer that. I rolled Luna off me and stood up. Luna stuck to my side as she watch a small asteroid go across my body. “Why have you followed us?”</p><p>“Chirp” I replied. <i>Have fun translating that.</i> Starswirl looked disappointed for a second before perking up.</p><p>“Well, whatever the reason, Luna is right. We are tracking down a beast of shadow. We would greatly appreciate if you would help us.” Swirl started. I nodded.</p><p>“Chirp.”</p><p>“Are you sure? It will be dangerous. I’d rather more lives not be lost in vain.” Tia said sadly. I was confused. I never heard of a ‘beast of shadow’ in the show. And lives lost in vain? What happened?</p><p>“What is your name creature? You appear intelligent enough to have one.” Swirl said. <i>I'm not sure whether to be insulted or not.</i></p><p>“Chirp” I shrugged sadly. <i>My name is Josh. But I can’t exactly tell you that.</i></p><p>“Oh.” Starswirl said. He slumped slightly.</p><p>“Nightwing.” Tia said. <i>What?</i></p><p>“What?” Swirl voiced my thoughts.</p><p>“Let’s call him Nightwing.” Tia suggested. “How does that sound?” She asked me.</p><p>“Chirp!” It wasn’t a half bad name.</p><p>“I like it!” Luna said.</p><p>“Caaaw!!” I yelled as I felt a sharp pain on my new tail. I looked back and saw Luna smiling and holding a long feather in her mouth. Surprisingly, it still showed space. She walked over to Tia and proudly held it out to her.</p><p>“Look sis! I brought you a pretty feather!!” Luna exclaimed, extremely proud of herself.</p><p>“Thank you lulu.” Tia giggled. “But let’s not take all of Night’s feathers. I don’t think he would like that.” She smiled at me. I made grumbling sound, but I was smiling internally. Luna was adorable.</p><p>“Well, it’s time for bed Luna, Tia.” Swirl announced. I then noticed how dark it had gotten.  “We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.” He lit his horn and several logs levitated out of the woods. He piled the logs in the middle of the clearing and a spark jumped from his horn into the pile. The logs lit up with orange flames. He pulled some sleeping bags out of some saddle bags I didn’t notice before. They were the same color as his fur. He passed two bags to the sisters and laid his own out on the ground. “Goodnight.” He said as he lay down. The sisters did the same, and a silence fell over our makeshift camp. I flew up to a low branch and perched there.</p><p>The fire reflected in my eyes as I watched over the sleeping ponies. I didn’t feel tired, so I instead let my mind wander. <i>How is my family taking this? Do they think I’m dead? Will I ever get back?</i> These thoughts and more went through my mind late into the night.</p>

					</header>


<p>The next day we set out early. The sun was just peaking out over the horizon and casting golden light through the trees. Luna was happily bouncing along next to her sister while I flew high above keeping a look out for....anything I guess. I noticed Swirl wave at me and I descended to the ground and hovered in front of him.</p><p>“Could you look for tracks that look like this?” He asked before levitating a stick and drawing in the dirt. He drew what looked like a big three clawed animal track. I studied the track and nodded at him. “Thank you. This will make our search much easier.” I nodded again and took off into the sky. I kept a sharp eye out for anything resembling what he had shown me. After a few hour though, I started wondering if I would ever see anything like it. I hadn’t seen any tracks or big beasts. What I had seen was lots of food. Mice, squirrels, rabbits. Even a few small birds looked appetizing.</p><p>Deciding to take a break from looking, I located something to eat. I set my sights on a squirrel eating nuts. I started to descend before I stopped. I was a hawk now. And I had always wanted to try sky diving. So, thinking over what I was about to do, I lined myself up with the squirrel. And I dove. Pinning my wings to my side, I dove faster than I had before. The wind whistled gloriously past my ears and my heart raced. Right before I hit the ground I opened my wings, turning my vertical movement into horizontal thrust. “KEEEEEEEEEEAR!!!” I shrieked right as I grabbed the squirrel. It struggled for a second before I bent my head down and bit it’s neck. When I did so I noticed frost bite on the squirrel where my talons dug into it. And on the neck where I bit it.</p><p>I settled down on the ground and started tearing into the squirrel. Using my hooked beak to tear the flesh, I made quick work of the corpse. After finishing I prepared to take off. Right before I did so though, I saw something in the dirt. I went to investigate the strange marking. When I got there I quickly realized it was the track I was looking for. Taking off in a cloud of dust, I climbed as fast as I could. I slowly circled until I saw where the others were. Once I above them I let out a loud shriek. “KEEEEEEEEEAR!!” When Starswirl looked up I made a ‘over here’ motion with my head and went to circle over the spot where I found the track. </p><p>When the ponies got close to the track I descended to meet them at the spot. Landing on the ground, I waited for the group to arrive. When they walked out of the trees I went to the mark and said “Chirp!” Swirl excitedly ran over to the track.</p><p>“Finally!! Some progress!!” He joyously stated. He followed the track across he clearing before returning to us. “It seems we’re going in the right direction. We simply need to adjust our heading slightly and we will run into the beast eventually.” I cocked my head and motioned at the mark with my talon. “We never told you why we are looking for this creature did we?” I shook my head. “Well-“ he started. But he stopped when he noticed the look on the sisters faces. “Tia, why don’t you take Luna to get some palmetto leaves. It looks like it might rain tonight.” I looked up at the cloudless sky and cocked my eye brow at him. He just shook his head at me as Tia took her sister to get palmetto leaves for the ‘rain’.</p><p>“Now then. I didn’t want Luna to hear us. She’s been through enough.” I tilted my head questioningly. “You see.” Swirl began. “A week ago we were staying at a village. Luna and Tia have lived with me since their parents death.” He looked down sadly. “It was a small village, and we had been there for nearly a year. The longest we had stayed in any one place due to risk of discovery.” I tilted my head at this. “They are a combination of all three races. I don’t want them to hide it, but I’m afraid of how other ponies will react. Racism is still common despite the windigos years ago. Anyways. We were at the village. It was as normal a day as any. I cast an illusion on the sisters at breakfast and left for work while they went to do odd jobs around town. I worked at the library on the far end of town. I was about half way there when the screaming began” he looked around nervously. “I ran in the direction it came from, but it was to late. Some beast had made it through the village walls. It was huge and covered in wispy shadows. By the time I had arrived it had killed four ponies already. And it wasn’t stopping. I charged up my strongest spell and fired it at him. But it shrugged it off. I stayed a long as I could, trying to fight it off. But worry overcame me and I went to look for the Tia and her sister.” He gained a sad look as he remembered the events. “When I found them, Tia was wrapped around Luna. They where huddled in an alley. Unsure of what was happening. It was about that time that the towns oil stores exploded. I don’t know how, but the oil storage caught fire. Flaming debris and oil rained across the town. We had no choice but to leave. We hid in the woods and hoped we weren’t found. When we came back the next day, all that was left was ash and a set of tracks. Celestia swore revenge, and we couldn’t leave Luna. So here we are. Hunting a monster I have no idea how to kill.” He looked ready to collapse from stress. </p><p>I shuffled over to him a laid a wing comfortingly on him. “Comforted by a bird.” He gave a smile smile. “Never thought I’d see the day. You will make one part of our journey easier. The tracking part. All I have to do now is figure out what to do when we find it. Our best bet is these.” He reached into his saddlebag and pulled out- <i>The Elements of Harmony!</i> I internally gasped. “After they defeated Discord I hid these away under every house we stayed in. I knew ponies would either fear them, or try to make them out as some deities. I don’t want either of those things for them. They deserve a good childhood.” I stood still. Staring at the powerful jewels in front of me. “So, surely a creature such as yourself has a story. What’s is it? Why are you all alone in the middle of nowhere?” Swirl attempted a small smile.</p><p>His question snapped me back to reality. <i>My story? Oh buddy, you have no idea.</i> I motioned to my throat with a wing. “Chirp.” Starswirl looked very disappointed at this.</p><p>“Oh well. Sad to say I don’t know anyone who can talk to animals.” He said wryly. At about this time the sisters came back. Neither carried anything, but they both looked excited. “What are you two grinning about?” Swirl asked them with a small smile.</p><p>“Look what we found!” Luna said in her high voice. She pulled a bundled up leaf from under her wing and held it out to Starswirl. He took it and unwrapped it in his magic.</p><p>“Blue berries! We found a whole bush of them!” Tia exclaimed.</p><p>“Mmhmm! And sis let me carry them!!” Luna beamed happily. <i>Thats to adorable. Maybe we can throw her at the beast and she can adorable it to death.</i> I smiled inwardly at my little joke.</p><p>“Well! This will certainly make for a good dinner! Let’s save some for tomorrow to.” Swirl told the sisters. With that they dug into the berries, deeply enjoying themselves. I wasn’t very hungry myself. Maybe I didn’t need to eat as much as a hawk?</p><p>As the light faded from the world we settled for the night. As the ponies slept I sat on a branch and watched over the camp. I stared at the track left in the dirt. <i>What are we going to do when find this thing? Zap it with the Elements and hope it works?</i> It didn’t seem like a good plan to me. And I was worried about Tia and Luna. If something happened to them then this world would be in for lots of trouble. But they were alive in the show so.....nothing bad could happen. Right?</p>

<p>So, I expect a lot of mixed reviews with this chapter. I honestly didn’t like it as much as my other chapters. I had to force a little bit of it. But leave a comment about what you liked and didn’t like. Also, I feel I should explain that this is AFTER Discord. But before Nightmare Moon. This is going to kind of bridge the two together if everything goes to plan. Which it won’t probably.</p>						</aside>

					</header>


<p>We set out earlier again the next morning. Swirl and the sisters packed their sleeping bags and started walking, with me trailing them high above. I would occasionally call out if I saw any tracks to alert Starswirl. We seemed to be making good progress, except for one thing.</p><p><i>Come on you stupid wings!! You didn’t do this before!</i> My wings seemed to be dragging the air more than usual. It slowed me down and made me have to flap near constantly to keep up with the group. <i>Oh my gosh this is a work out.</i> I huffed into the wind. My wings were starting to burn and I needed to catch my breath. “KEEEEEAR!!”I screeched. Swirl stopped along with Luna and Tia to watch me spiral down. I aimed for a branch beside them but missed it by quite a bit. “Caaaaw!!!” I.....cawed. Flapping my wings to slow myself down, I hit the dirt and rolled. <i>Ooooow.</i> I laid there catching my breath.</p><p>“Are you ok!?” Luna ran up to me and jumped on my chest. <i>Oh god!</i> “Are you awake!?”</p><p>“Luna! Get off of him, your hurting him!” Tia ran up to her and pulled her off of me. <i>oh thank goodness.</i> I took in big gulps of air as the weight was lifted off of me. “Are you ok Night?”</p><p>I shook my head and took deep breaths. “Hmmmm.” Starswirl hummed. He leaned close to me and observed something he found interesting. “Have you been preening?” <i>Preening? Why would I-oh</i></p><p>“Chirp.” <i>How do I tell them I don’t know how to preen? I’m a bird to them.</i></p><p>“Well no wonder your exhausted. Everything with wings needs to preen. Why haven’t you been doing it?”</p><p>“Chirp.” I motioned to my wings with my head and shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>“What? You don’t know how?” Tia asked disbelievingly.</p><p>“That’s crazy! I learned to preen years ago!” Luna added. “How old are you?”</p><p>“Chirp.” Another shrug.</p><p>“You don’t know? That’s sad. I’m a whole three years old!!” Luna bragged. I couldn’t help but smile internally at that.</p><p>“Would you like help?” Tia asked. I nodded, a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Your a strange bird Night. A very strange bird.” Swirl commented.</p><p>And so Tia began instructing me on how to care for my feathers while Swirl and Luna rested nearby. She did one of my wings and let me do the other, only correcting me when needed. I fell into a rhythm of adjusting feathers. It was a deceptively easy task. Turns out I had oil glands at the base of each feather. I had to use my beak to straiten each feather, then coat it with a little oil. It also helped when you had what amounted to a real-time video of space to watch. Did I mention I love space?</p><p>This was also my first real chance to get really close to one of the ponies. As we both worked on my wing I studied her closely. Her mane was just shy of being a painful pink, settling on a baby pink. It didn’t flow yet so I wondered when that started. She was just barely bigger than me and Swirl. <i>I wonder how other ponies will react to a giant hawk.</i> I made a snickering noise as I thought about that. Had they discovered griffins yet? Even if they had, they where different than a full on bird.</p><p>I noticed she didn’t use her magic to adjust any feather. <i>Now that I think about it, neither her nor Luna have used any magic.</i> I moitoined with my finished wing at her horn. “Chirp?”</p><p>“What?” Tia looked at her horn in confusion. “What’s wrong with my Horn? Is there something on it?” She started rubbing her horn in an attempt to remove whatever was there.</p><p>“Chirp.” I shook my head and motioned to Starswirl, who was levitating Luna around.</p><p>“Oooh. Well, Luna and I don’t use magic because Starswirl illusion spell keeps us from using it. It prevents us from accidentally levitating something if we’re not paying attention.” She frowned a little. “Unfortunately he hasn’t figured out how to shorten the magic prevention with the illusion. So we can’t use magic for a full day after the illusion is dispelled. And we haven’t used any today because there hasn’t been a reason to.” I motioned my head at the wing we were working on. “Oh, magic is no good for preening. You can’t feel with your magic as well as you can by actually touching something.”<br/><i>Huh. The more you know.</i> She levitated a branch over to us and started spinning it in the air. “Starswirl also puts a magic blocking spell on Luna. Young unicorns tend to have a few magic surges. Especially alicorns foals it seems.” She paused to adjust a couple feathers. “When combined with the illusion spell it blocks the surges completely. The down side is that it stores the surge. Releasing it later when it’s dispelled. But on its own it just lessens the severity.” Tia explained. She looked thoughtfully at my wing before adjusting a few more feathers. I realized I wasn’t helping and leaned down to work more on the wing. <i>Apparently I’m getting a magic lesson. Never thought that would happen.</i> With a few twists of my head I finished the last couple feathers.</p><p>“Chirp!” I thanked Celestia, nodding my head at how clean my wings looked. The next second I was on the ground with something on my back.</p><p>“Your wings are even more pretty now!!” Luna yelled in excitement. It was true. You know when you get dust on your glasses, or your phone screen and you don’t notice how blurred the screen was until you brush it off? That’s how my wings where. I didn’t notice how much the dirt and dust fogged them up until they were clean.</p><p>“Yes yes. Pretty bird. Now we need to move. We have wasted enough day light by now.” Starswirl smirked at me as he saw me staring at my wings. <i>What? There cool ok!?</i></p><p>“Caaaaaw!” I flew over him and knocked off his hat. Flapping my wings was much smoother now, and I could glide full speed again. I looked down and saw Swirl grumbling as he picked up his hat and settled it on his head. I smiled internally as I looked down at them. <i>These ponies are really growing on me.</i></p><hr/><p>That night, as everyone settled down, I thought about some things that were bothering me. Namely, the fact I wasn’t as freaked out as I should be. I should be freaked out about being in another dimension. I should be depressed beyond belief at being away from my family. I <b>should</b> be more concerned about getting home. Yet I wasn’t. I was traveling through the woods with three magical ponies. As a bird. Hunting a shadow monster. <i>Just another Tuesday.</i></p>

<p>“Alright, we’ll be arriving at the town in a few minutes. Lets cast the illusion spell.” Starswirl told the sisters. The only reason I heard is because I was walking beside them. The only reason I was walking beside them is because the town would see me if I was flying. The only reason I’m stressing this point so much is because I REALLY want to be flying. It’s addicting. <i>All those years of just saying no.</i></p><p>Starswirl cast the illusion on Tia and little Luna. I watched there horns fade away until nothing was there. “Now.” Swirl turned and looked at me. “You are going to be a problem.” <i>Me?</i> I cocked my head. “Yes you. Don’t think you get out of going to town with us. Hmmm.” His horn lit and I felt a tingling for a second before it stopped. I looked down expecting a pony, but I still looked the same. “Just as I thought. I can not cast an illusion on you.” He sat down and started stroking his beard. <i>Well. I guess I could stay in the woods.</i> I looked around. <i>Probably hunt some thing to. Getting a little hungry.</i></p><p>When we started walking that morning, Starswirl had told us we were getting close to a village. Which was good because they were running low on hay. <i>Yuck. Can’t imagine dry grass tasting very good....of course I wouldn’t have thought raw rabbit was good a few days ago either.</i></p><p>“Oh well.” Swirl said, pulling my gaze back to him. “Well just have to do this the old fashioned way.”</p><hr/><p>I was not happy. <i>Hes probably laughing his head off on the inside.</i> I grimaced as my wing cramped a little, soon joined by my leg. <i>I’m gunna kill somebody when this is over.</i></p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours, the little crate I was in stopped moving. And dropped to the ground with a bang. “Caaaaw!” I grimaced as I landed on my wing. With a screeching noise, the lid was pulled off the crate. I scrambled out and collapsed on the cold stone floor. <i>Fresh air!!</i> I took big gulps of air as I lay on my back and let my wings stretch as far as they could.</p><p>“Be quiet you feather brain! We don’t want somebody hearing you.” Swirl glared at me. “Besides, it wasn't that bad.” I glared at him. “You get used to it.”</p><p>Looking away from him I took in the building around us. We were in a simple looking house. I was laying just beside the front door. A short hallway led from the door into a living room that took up the back half of the house. Before it reached the living room it had two doorways in it, directly across from each other. I stood up and looked through them. The one on the left led to a kitchen. The kitchen didn’t have much in it. Just a wood stove, a sink, a few cabinets, and what looked to be a pantry in the back. On the right side it had a door that led back to the living room. <i>I’ll have to check out the sink later. Didn’t think they had running water yet.</i> I left the kitchen to check out the other room. It looked like a mudroom, except it had a small tub in the middle with a wide, bumpy piece of wood in it. <i>A washboard. Must be where they do laundry.</i> </p><p>Going back into the hall, I turned and went into the living room. It was relatively small. Of course, the whole house didn’t look to big. It had a few wooden chairs a table and a fireplace. On the right side were some stairs leading to a second floor. I started to walk toward them until Tia started talking.</p><p>“See you later Luna. Nightwing will watch you while we’re gone.” Tia said as she and Swirl walked toward the door. <i>WHAT!?</i></p><p>“Caaaaw!” I yelled. Quickly I ran over to Starswirl and Tia. I pointed at the door and tilted my head.</p><p>“We need money to pay for food.” Swirl stated. “Usually Tia will take Luna with her while she does odd jobs, but its hard to work and watch a sibling. So you are on foal sitting duty. Congratulations!!” He smirked at me. “And remember, be quiet. Giant hawks aren’t exactly common you know.” With that he and Tia walked out the front door while I stood there, stunned.</p><p><i>I can’t take care of a filly!! I’ve never even touched a horse!</i> I started panicking while I sat there by the front door. That is, until something hit my chest and made me and it roll all the way into the living room.</p><p>“Isn’t this great!?” The object on my chest said. I looked down to see Luna hugging me tightly. “We get to spend the whole day together!!” She beamed up at me. <i>Oooh. I can’t stay upset with that face looking at me.</i></p><p>“Chirp.” I gently pushed her off and looked around. What was there to do with a little filly?</p><p>“Hey look! They have books over here!” Luna stood by a previously unnoticed book shelf. “They all look pretty boring though. Just school books on magic.” I perked up at that. <i>Magic?</i> I walked up to the book shelf and looked at the spines of the books. They all looked like the spines of boring text books. They didn’t even have names on the spines. Just some fancy squiggles at the bottom of the spine.</p><p>“Chirp?”</p><p>“Oh, I know they're magic book because of those little squiggles at the bottom. All of Star’s magic books had those.” Luna explained. <i>Hmmmm. Well if it’s about magic, then surely it can’t be THAT boring.</i> I pulled one off the shelf with my talon and laid it on the floor. “Are you actually gunna read that? It’s really boring stuff.” Luna cutely pouted when I opened the book and started reading. “Well be that way then. I’m just gunna look at your pretty wings. I love stars.”</p><p>A few minutes later had Luna pacing around the room. “Come on!! Let’s do something fun.”</p><p>“Chirp!”I replied. I was enraptured by the book. I had been right. It wasn’t boring at all! <i>Magic is awesome!</i> I thought as I looked over different diagrams that demonstrated how to do spells. A particularly interesting one was the shadow puppet spell. It stated that it was for foals to use for shadow puppets, but I had a sneaking suspicion that it was made for other things. The fact that it was an adult book talking about foal stuff was the first sign something was up. The fact it showed a pony wrapping themselves in shadow was another. <i>Must be trying to mislead people reading it. Don’t want everybody knowing that you sell books with dangerous spells in them. </i></p><p>“Uuuugh! This is boring!” Luna said. She hopped over to where I had the book. “Ooh! That looks cool!!” She looked over my shoulder. “To bad my magic is locked. I would try it out if I could.” <i>Thank goodness it’s locked. I don’t want you running around the house as a shadow.</i> Luna looked at the diagram for awhile until she decided she was bored again. She laid down beside me and lifted my wing over her. Snuggling into my side she said “Your really warm. And boring.” She let out a yawn. She was asleep in a few minutes.</p><hr/><p>By the time the others got back it was already dark. Swirl and Tia pranced into the living room, chatting away to each other. “Caaaw.” I said quietly to get there attention. Once they were both looking at me I pointed my head at Luna.</p><p>“Aaaaw! She so adorable.” Tia cooed. While Tia was watching her sister sleep, I was glaring at Starswirl.</p><p>“What?” He looked at me innocently. “You did a very good job foal sitting. And we made enough money for food! Tia even got herself a new cloak.” He pulled a tan colored cloak with a hood out of his saddle bag. “Isn’t it nice?”</p><p>I simply glared and pretended I could use that levitation spell I saw earlier. Imagine my surprise when his hat yanked itself down over his eyes. “Hey!!” He yelled. Luna stirred slightly under my wing before settling down. He turned to glare at Tia. “What was that for!?”</p><p>“I didn’t do anything!” Tia defended.</p><p>“Chirp.” I shushed the two, pointing at Luna with my head.</p><p>“So my hat just yanked itself down for no reason?” Starswirl had a ‘really?’ look on his face.</p><p>“I didn’t do it! I promise!” <i>Ok, as amusing as this is, they’re going to wake up Luna if they continue with this.</i></p><p>“Chirp!” I got the attention of both of them. I glared at them both before pointing once again at Luna. They both winced at that, realizing they almost woke her. Then I grabbed Swirl’s hat with my telekinesis. <i>I got the magic!!</i> I cheered in my head. I brought his hat over to me and set it upon my head. I gave Starswirl a cheeky grin. Apparently beaks can smile.</p><p>“You clever bird.” Starswirl breathed “You can use magic? But you don’t have a horn.” He walked up and looked me in the eye. “Do it again. Now.” <i>Stay out of my bubble please.</i> I pushed him back with my new found magic. “Amazing.”He said as the black aura disappeared from him. “It seems that your black aura appears around your eyes when you use magic. I wonder what other spells you can do.” <i>None right now. That little bit made me tired.</i></p><p>“Chirp.” I rolled onto my back and pulled Luna onto my chest.</p><p>“We have beds upstairs you know.” Tia said. I just shook my head and closed my eyes. Sleep quickly took me.</p>

<p>Ever woke up to an annoying alarm clock? It has the most annoying buzz ever? It makes you want to smack the closest thing to you and kill the sun? You know what I’m talking about? Good. Cuz that’s not what happened this morning. Or night  actually. I woke up to screaming. Not the ‘Oh god I forgot the cake in the oven!’ Screaming. Not the ‘Oh god my kitchens on fire!’ Screaming. It was the ‘OH GOD!!! I’M BEING EATIN ALIVE!!!’ Screaming.</p><p>“What in the blazes!?” I heard Starswirl upstairs. I tried to get up, only to be held down by a quickly waking Luna.</p><p>“What’s happening!?”She cowered into me and I wrapped my wings around her. </p><p>“Starswirl!! Come look quickly!!” Tia shouted. I heard rapid footsteps as more screams seeped in from outside. Presumably Tia and Swirl where looking out a window.</p><br/><p>“Great Discord!! Not again!!” Swirl exclaimed. <i>What again!? What’s happening!?</i> I rolled over a dumped Luna on the floor. Then, as an apology, I levitated her and put her on my back. I ran upstairs to where I heard Tia and Swirl. “Not here.” I heard Swirl say from a room to the side. I busted through the door and ran up to the window, standing beside them. “We’re not ready!” What I saw outside was chaos. Ponies running everywhere, knocking each other down, lying dead in the streets. <i>What did this!? What are they running from!?</i> My question was answered promptly.</p><p>A huge feline beast walked around the corner onto our street. In held a pony in its jaws, or it did, until it bit clean through it and the two halves fell to the street leaking blood. I pulled Luna into my side and covered her with a wing, not wanting her to see. I was to late though judging by the sobbing coming from under the feathers. It darted forward, almost to fast to see, and grabbed another pony. Shadows seemed to leak out it’s mouth, eyes, and even skin. We were all broken out of shock when it looked right at us. Then suddenly, it was gone....until the door below us crashed in and something pounded up the stairs. Starswirl quickly lit his horn and with a flash teleported us out. Except only him and Tia teleported. Not even thinking , I wrapped Luna in my wings and pressed up on the wall. The beast barged in right as my feathers changed to look like the wall. The only thing not cloaked was my eyes and talons. <i>Come on! Shut your eyes!!</i> I yelled at my self. Luna had quieted down, likely knowing it was in the room. But if it saw my eyes it would surely see us. Ever tried shutting your eyes with a monster hunting you? It’s not easy. <i>Shut! Your! EYES!!</i> I finally did it. And I was terrified. I couldn’t see where the creature was, but I could hear him walking. And walking. And then it stopped. And I waited. When nothing happened I released a breath I didn’t realize I had been holding.</p><p>“KEEEEEEEEAR!!!” That breath quickly turned into a shriek as it bit into my wing and tore it off. I had never felt such pain. “KEEEEEAR!!!” I shrieked once more in agony. I threw my talons forward and scratched across its face. Thinking quickly, I ran to the window and <b>threw</b> Luna through it before the creature dragged me back. “CAAAAAAA-ACK” My angry caw turned into a choke as the creature sank his fangs into my throat. I used my talons to scratch him every where I could reach, leaving trails of frost bitten flesh all over his front half. My one wing beat uselessly against his face trying vainly to loosen his hold. My scratches started to slow and weaken, and my wing stopped flapping. My body just started twitching in a final effort to get away. As my thoughts slowed to a stop, I thought one last thing. <i>At least I did something worth doing before I died.</i></p><hr/><p>Starswirl</p><p>Tia and I ran back to the house at full tilt. I don’t know why, but the spell didn’t work. Sure it was experimental, but I had tested it many times. <i>It should have worked!!</i> We both ran faster when we heard Nightwing shriek in pain. As we neared the house the window exploded and Luna hit the ground with a dull thump. “Luna!!” Tia screamed beside me. She ran ahead to her sister while I ran into the house. <i>Dont you dare die!!</i> I raced up the steps as I heard a crow call suddenly stopped by choking. I blew the door off it’s hinges just in time to see his body twitch a few final times. Just in time for the creature to glare at me with it’s one good eye left and it’s blackened front half. Just in time for my anger to boil over and charge a bolt of magic the size of my head.</p><p>“SKRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!” The monster cried when the bolt hit it. As it lay stunned I ran back outside. I grabbed the sisters and ran. I picked up every pony we came across and continued to the edge of town. By the time we got there I had six other ponies in my magic. And the beast was the only thing in our way. It appeared as if out of air, blood still on it’s muzzle, and a few familiar feathers stuck in it's fur. It let out a deep growl as it advanced on us. I looked desperately to the right. Then the left. There was no way out. The ponies in my grasp sobbed as they accepted their fate. The sisters had forlorn looks on their faces. The monster had a savage glee in his eye. And I....I said no more. <i>Lets try this again.</i> I charged up as much energy as I could into my horn. Time seemed to slow. The monster almost hovered, mid leap, as I released the magic. And the creature landed on nothing. We were gone.</p>

<p>Third Person POV</p><p>In a clearing far away, a loud POP and a flash of light lit up the forest. Nine ponies appeared out of thin air, and a bearded one collapsed from exhaustion. “Starswirl!!” Tia shouted and ran to check on him.</p><p>“I’m fine.” He grumbled. “Go check on your sister.” He pointed to the sobbing Luna.</p><p>“Where are we!?”</p><p>“What happened!?”</p><p>“Bronze!! Where are you!?” Starswirl grimaced at the shouting from the other ponies.</p><p>“Be quiet!” He shouted. The other ponies fell silent, the only sound sniffling from a few of them. “We need to start moving. I don’t know where we are, and some of you are bleeding. That’s a guarantee we’ll see some timberwolves.”</p><p>“You did this!” A earth pony stallion came up to Starswirl, A larger earth pony mare right behind him.</p><p>“Did what? Slaughter the town or save you all? Because I know I didn’t do the first one!” Swirl yelled at him.</p><p>“Forgive my brother.” The large earth pony mare said. She was huge in every sense of the word. “He can be a bit careless with his temper. The names Stone Slab! This is my brother Bullseye.” Starswirl could clearly see the resemblance. Stone Slab had a brown coat and a gray mane. While Bullseye had a dark grey coat and a brown mane. Stone’s cutie mark was a wagon with a slab of stone in it. Bullseye’s was a target with spears crossed over it.</p><p>“Just make keep your anger in check and we should be fine around each other.” Starswirl glared at Bullseye. He turned to address the sisters but stopped when an aching pain ran through his horn. He grimaced and clutched his head until somepony ran up to his side. </p><p>“Relax. You just used a lot of magic at one time. Does anyone here know pain numbing spells?” The mare pressed int Swirl’s side asked.</p><p>“I do!” A unicorn stallion ran up to Starswirl and lit his horn. His coat was a light blue and his mane a deep purple. He had a aloe plant as a cutie mark. Almost instantly the pain faded. </p><p>“Thank you..” Swirl trailed off</p><p>“Healing Touch! At your service!” The unicorn announced.</p><p>“I’m Lavender Kettle.” The mare told swirl in a gentle voice. The mare had a dark pink coat and a green and blue striped mane. Her mark was a Kettle with a piece of lavender sticking through the top.</p><p>“Well thank you both. I’m afraid further introductions will have to wait however, we need to start moving.” As if to illustrate Starswirl’s point, a loud howl echoed in the distance from far away. “Healing! Get to the front and help me light up the area so we can see. We don’t need any broken legs from tripping on tree roots.”</p><hr/><p>An hour later and the sky was just starting to lighten. Swirl fell towards the back of the line, pulling the sisters with him. Once they were behind everyone else he whispered to them. “I need to remove the illusion. We are defenseless out here and it would be better to have powerful magic late than never.”</p><p>“Are you sure Starswirl?” Tia looked nervously ahead to make sure no one heard them. “We’ve spent so much time hiding. Is it really safe to do this?”</p><p>“Yeah. You said ponies might hurt us.” Luna looked more sad than scared. The loss of Nightwing clearly affecting her.</p><p>“I know what I said. But that’s not a guarantee. It’s just a small chance. A chance I wasn’t willing to take before, but now I have no choice. I just want your permission. The decision is up to you two.” Swirl explained to them. Luna and Celestia looked at each other and nodded.</p><p>“Alright Starswirl. Let’s do it. The sooner the better. We may not have much time before timberwolves show up.” Celestia spoke for both of them. Starswirl looked down in grim acceptance. He was hoping for some way out of this situation.</p><p>“Ok, Put this on Celestia.” He pulled her cloak out of the saddle bags he grabbed from the house. Handing it to her he looked to Luna. “What to do.....aha!” He used his magic to style her mane in such a way that it would cover her horn when it reappeared. “Ok, are you both ready?” The sisters nodded and Starswirl’s horn began to glow. With a low POP the disguises fell.</p><p>“What was that!?” A pony asked from the middle of the group. Starswirl hadn’t met him yet. He was a unicorn with a gray coat and a silver mane. His mark was a anvil.</p><p>“Nothing.” Swirl assured. “Just some accidental magic. My horns still a little sore.”</p><p>“Hmm.” A mare up front with Healing Touch looked suspiciously at Starswirl. She had a light gray coat and a dark blue mane. After staring for a minute she turned around and continued walking with Healing. A few minutes later she had ended up at the back beside Swirl. “Your a terrible liar mage....I’m misty. The gray Stallion up there is Silver Anvil.” With that she flew up to the front of the group again.</p><p>After a moment of silence Luna spoke. “I like her!”</p><hr/><p>Several hours later found the group still walking through the woods. Several times Misty had flown up to look around, but she had spotted no nearby towns. Apparently she was a guard at the village. Her mark was two silver wing blades crossed over each other. She still wore silver wing blades, though it had been hard to see at night. One was snapped off half way down the length of it.</p><p>They were all sitting down for a short break at the moment. Lavender had spotted some herbs and was stuffing them in her mane due to a lack of saddle bags. She looked quite comical with leaves sticking out of her hair. Though it looked as if she did this often as hardly any fell out.</p><p>It was during this quiet time that the snapping twigs really stood out. Everyone perked up and looked towards the sound. Low growls filled the air as six pairs of green eyes appeared. “Starswirl.” Tia whispered. “Is there anyway to speed up our magic recovery?”</p><p>“No. Try to access it all you can, but unless alicorns are different you shouldn’t be able to do anything more than simple levitation at this point. And even that is being generous.” Swirl explained grimly. The ponies huddled together in the middle of the clearing as the wolves surrounded them.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can fight these guys.” Misty said. “I’m feeling pretty weak from last night.” The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Well, no choice but to fight. Eh Brother?” Stone Slab asked her brother.</p><p>“If I had my spear I might stand a chance.” He said in a deep voice. With that the wolves lept in action. One lept at the earth pony siblings and was quickly kicked away. It merely stood again and growled. One more jumped into the air at Misty, but it to was swatted away. Tia bucked a wolf away from Luna and covered her protectively. It seemed to be going good until Tia got distracted by a wolf lunging at Starswirl. She went to help only for Swirl to launch it away via magic. Unfortunately she left her sister exposed.</p><p>“Aaaah!” Luna shrieked. Celestia spun and around and looked in horror.</p><p>“<b>NOOO!!!</b>” Tia luanched the wolf through a tree and far into the woods right before it grabbed Luna. The other ponies looked at her in shock.</p><p>“How did you-?” Misty was interrupted by a wolf grabbing her leg and dragging her down. “Aaah!” She hit the ground hard. The wolves jaws went to close around her neck. And suddenly it was gone. “What the-!?” The wolves looked around in confusion. Until a blue streak took another off into the woods. And another. The fourth simply exploded into frozen splinters. And the fifth almost escaped to the woods. Almost. A blue streak dragged it into the air quickly, and then the clearing was silent. Until the wolf fell back down, dead. It’s body splintered as it impacted the ground, and it’s dead head rolled over to Lavender, dead eyes staring strait into hers.</p><p>“Aah!” She lept behind Healing Touch, who flinched at her loud scream. They all looked around the clearing, confused as to what just happened. Until a giant hawk landed in the middle of the clearing.</p><p>“Oh buck!!” Misty charged at the hawk, only to get slammed into the ground by Starswirl.</p><p>“Nightwing!! Your alive!!” Luna ran up to the huge bird and hugged him, much to the horror of everyone present. Then their confusion as it didn’t eat her. </p><p>“Oooooow.” The hawk looked from Misty to Starswirl and facewinged.</p><hr/><p>Five Minutes Ago</p><p>Nightwing</p><p>Dying sucked. Especially went you where killed by something with teeth. It was slightly less sucky when you exploded back to life in a flurry of snow that froze the surrounding area. But it still sucked. A lot.</p><p><i>OH MY GOD!!!</i> I freaked out in my head. <i>I JUST DIED!!! AND CAME BACK TO LIFE!! And I’m lost again!!! Crap.</i> I quickly checked my self over. Making sure my wing was still there. I shivered at the thought of losing it forever. That is until I heard yelling and wood impacting wood. Then a dead timberwolf flew out of the woods and shattered on the tree next to me. I stared wide eyed at the dented tree next to my head.</p><p>Shaking slightly, I took flight. Quickly locating the source of commotion, and seeing Tia huddled protectively over Luna, I put the two and two together. <i>She is never living this one down.</i></p><hr/><p>Present</p><p><i>I leave for two seconds. And this happens.</i> I looked at the ragtag group of ponies and realized this was all that Starswirl managed to grab. I turned to look at Swirl and pointed at the undisguised sisters, injured ponies, and dead timberwolves. “Chirp?” I tilted my head.</p><p>“Oh hush.” He looked genuinely happy to see me. “Like you could could have done better.” Then he actually ran up and hugged me. <i>Ooook then</i> I awkwardly payed him on the back with a wing. “We thought you were dead! You should have run damn it!!” He pulled back and glared at me. <i>Oh come on! I panicked!</i></p><p>“Um. What’s going on?” A light blue stallion asked, clearly confused.</p>

<p>Soaring through the air, I looked down on the ponies. After we all got introduced....the ponies were still nervous around me. Being a giant predator does that. Especially when their town just got massacred. A pang of regret went through me. <i>I wish we could have saved more.</i> As far as we knew these were the only survivors. It was likely others survived, but we had yet to see anyone. And with two pairs of eyes in the sky we would have seen anyone nearby. Speaking of which, my current flight partner soared her way over to me. After she got within a few feet of my wing tips, which was still pretty far, she stopped and just watched the forest with me. She hadn’t done much walking since the fight. Mostly sticking to the air. Her leg was doing good for what had happened to it. That said, it still looked pretty bad. Lavender had made some kind of healing goop to put on it and Healing Touch has put a pain numbing spell on it. The bit marks were wide and slightly long from where the teeth dragged through her flesh as the wolf pulled her. “We’re looking for ponies you know, not legs.” I snapped my head up as she spoke. Her eyes were locked ahead of her, not even glancing at me. “So, how does a giant bird end up with a mage and two....whatever they are?”</p><p><i>That almost sounded like the start of a bad joke.</i> I chuckled wryly in my head. “Chirp!” I announced.</p><p>“Right, can’t talk. How about one Chirp for yes and two for no? Got it? Good.” She turned her head as something caught her eye before she refocused ahead of her. “So...” She seemed to struggle for a way to word what she wanted to ask. After a moment of thinking she spoke again. “You all were hunting that creature weren’t you? None of you seemed as surprised as the others.”</p><p>“Chirp.”</p><p>She seemed to think a moment more before asking another question. “How did you get in town unseen? The mage doesn’t seem the type to leave someone outside in the cold.” I didn’t say anything as I flapped my wings a couple times to maintain our height. “Right, sorry. Yes or no, you were stuffed into the big box the mage brought into town weren’t you?” She smirked a little at that.</p><p>“Chirp.” I said, irritated.</p><p>She seemed to pick up on my irritation easily. “Oh yeah. I was on gate duty when he came into town. That crate looked a little small.” She snickered a little as my eyes narrowed. <i>Never again.</i> “Alright I leave that alone. It seems like a sore spot.” She laughed a little more. “So, I’m guessing you got roped into their little quest huh? I can’t imagine you just sticking with a unicorn and some half breeds for no reason.” She confidently stated. <i>Half breeds?</i> My eyes narrowed at that. <i>A little rude don’t you think?</i></p><p>“Caaaaw!” I stated my irritation with that statement quite clearly.</p><p>“What? You didn’t like me calling them half breeds? That’s what they are isn’t it? I know we’re all supposed to get along now but that’s a little far.” She looked down at the sisters. “Maybe it’s just my pegasi pride, but I don’t like the idea of unicorns with wings.” <i>Racist.</i> “That’s not bad is it? Everyone says it is. What do you think?” She looked over at me. When I didn’t respond she corrected herself. “Right. Is it bad that I think of pegasi as better than other ponies?</p><p>“Chirp!” I loudly stated. With that I glided away from her and left her to her thoughts. I checked on the group below and something caught my interest. Silver Anvil seemed to be having a conversation with Celestia. It was strange because he had said almost nothing the entire time we had been traveling. It was stranger because Celestia seemed to be blushing and acting more shy than usual. <i>Oh you sly dog. Hitting on Celestia?</i> I chuckled and raised my eyes up to scan the horizon again.</p><hr/><p>An hour later we spotted the first town in the distance. “Keeeeear!” I shrieked.</p><p>“What is it!?” Misty asked. She flew over to me and started scanning the ground for trouble. I rose an eyebrow and pointed my head at the small city in the distance. She squinted for a minute before she saw the town. “You can see that? That’s far off. We pegasi have far eyesight.” She bragged. “But we can’t see as far as you can as clearly. At least I can’t. I can barely see that.” She looked around the horizon and furrowed her eyebrows. “If I’m right, then Thoughts Mountain in the distance means we’re coming up to Brightshine. It’s a little mining town. Or it was, until they discovered massive silver deposits in the area. Along with a lot of gems.”</p><p>“Aaaahaaa!!” Someone yelled below. It sounded like Bullseye. I looked down to see Starswirl looking panicked and the sisters looking shifty. I swooped down to see what was happening. “I knew I recognized you lot! Your them ponies that defeated Discord!”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Starswirl asked. “Even if we did, how would you know?”</p><p>“Because you defeated him in the middle of Brightshine!! I was hoping to visit some family before we all died to that monster, when you all popped up in the city square! Discord a statue and you three running off before anybody could react! But I’ll never f’rget those horns and wings. Never seen a pony with both since then.” Bullseye explained.</p><p>“Now that you mention it, I do remember some ponies talking about winged unicorns defeating discord. Everyone dismissed them as crazy.” Healing Touch said. “Myself included.” Misty flew down and hovered by me.</p><p>“Well, I’m sure Star here would tell us if that was the case right Star?” Sone asked him.</p><p>“Of course I would. What your saying is preposterous.” Starswirl defended.</p><p>“Well, there’s your answer brother! Let’s just continue on our way.” She started walking again, dragging her brother behind her.</p><p>“Um, we located a town. Brightshine by the looks of it.” Misty said catching everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Really? Well then, let’s not waste anymore time!” Swirl started walking rapidly in the direction Misty pointed.</p><p>“What was that about?” Misty asked me. I didn’t answer as I watched Stone and Bullseye wink at each other before following. With that I flew back up to watch over everything. “Hey!” Misty yelled as I hit her with a wing. “What was that for!?”</p><hr/><p>A few hours later we arrived at the outskirts of town. We stopped just inside the woods so we were out of sight. “Ok. Here is where we part ways. You all can go to the town over there and we will go on about our business.” Starswirl said to everyone. I stood atop a tree branch and rested for a minute. The ponies all looked at each other with raised brows for a minute.</p><p>“Pardon me if I sound rude but, it seems you needed us as much as we needed you. We helped fight off those wolves before your bird friend showed up. Safety in numbers and all that.” Bullseye stated. <i>Bird friend? I’ll have you know I am a purebred hawk of the highest caliber.</i> I smiled at my internal joke. </p><p>“While I hate to admit it, Bullseye is right. You guys are going after that thing right? Well I’m not going anywhere. We deserve revenge just as much as you!” Misty loudly declared.</p><p>“Besides, you might need a poultice or two if you get hurt.” Lavender gently said.</p><p>“Or a spell! I’m a trained nurse you know!” Healing happily declared. Stone sSlab looked around before speaking.</p><p>“Well, I suppose I could carry stuff. I’m not a fighter like my brother, but I’m a good bit stronger.” She hit her brother in the shoulder good naturedly. </p><p>“I would like to come as well.” Silver shyly looked over at Celestia, making her blush. Starswirl looked around the group.</p><p>“Nothing I say will change your minds?” Swirl asked. Everyone shook their heads. Starswirl sighed at this. “Very well. But you all do as I say. Ok?” Everyone one agreed except Misty. She gave a pained look before finally nodding. “Good. Now, if I am correct, you and Bullseye were guards correct?” He asked Misty.</p><p>“Served for ten years.” Misty boasted. “But uh, my blades are broke. And I need a doctor for this leg before we go anywhere.”</p><p>“Yes, I noticed. We will head into town and visit the local smithy. And get you to a doctor. You don’t want that left untreated.” Swirl said. “So me and the sisters will stay here while you all go into town and get things sorted out.”</p><p>“Nice try, but no.” Stone made Swirl deflate.</p><p>“You can't blame a stallion for trying right?” Swirl asked. “Very well, let’s go.” He looked at me for a second. “Could you keep an eye on things from above? We can’t exactly have you seen.” I nodded at him and took off.</p><p>As they all walked into town, with the exception of Misty as she hovered, I couldn’t help but feel we had forgotten something. <i>What is it? I swear I’m forgetting something major.</i> “THE SAVIORS!!! THEY'RE BACK!!!” A random pony shouted from below. <i>Oh....that’s what we forgot.</i></p>

<p>The ponies of the town gathered around our group below as more and more of the town heard about what was happening. Luna hid behind Celestia, who had a worried look on her face, and Starswirl made a flickering dome around them. He had a terrified look on his face as the crowd pressed closer. And with the shield up he couldn’t teleport out. “BE QUIEEEEEET!!” Shouted Bullseye from below. I watched from above, ready to dive in at a moments notice. Though I had a feeling the town ponies wouldn't hurt them. “Now ah know your all excited!” Bullseye continued. “But we’ve been through a rough spot recently! So we wouldn’t mind if you would all kindly back off for a while! Just long enough for us to get some rest at an inn!”</p><p>“You can stay at my inn for free!!”</p><p>“I’ll pay you to stay at my inn!!!” The ponies all began offering free accommodations to the group, excitedly pestering them. With a grimace Starswirl’s shield fell down. The ponies began to press closer and Luna got a scared look on her face. Stone Slab and Bullseye got worried looks, along with the rest of the not being mobbed. As the crowd grew a little too close a few tears came to Luna’s eyes. <i>Thats enough of that.</i></p><p>“KEEEEEEEEAR!” I dropped like a bullet, opening my wings at the last moment, and landed with a wave of air beside the sisters. “CAAAAW!!” I spread my wings around them and glared at the ponies.</p><p>“Oh yeah! He’s with us to!!” Bullseye said, looking relieved. The locals looked between me, the sisters under my wings, and Starswirl. Swirl let out a tired sigh.</p><p>“We’ll stay with whoever will take us.” Swirl announced. All the hooves raised into the air. “All, of us.” Most of the hooves went down. Most ponies didn’t have the space for that many guest. “Including him.” Swirl pointed at me. At this only one hoof remained. <i>Yes yes, let’s all exile the giant hawk.</i> I thought wryly. I was a little insulted, but not enough to care. Swirl went up to the pony with their hoof up. The crowd parted as he walked through it, a couple even bowed. “What’s your name?” He asked the mare.</p><p>“Tidy house!” She practically yelled. She slapped her hooves over her mouth. “Sorry. I’m just excited.” Starswirl had a look of irritation and slight relief as he looked around at the crowd.</p><p>“Yes, well. We have had a.....long trip. Could you please take us to where we can rest? We can discuss payment letter.” Swirl told the mare. She paled slightly at the mention of payment, but nodded and started walking through the town excitedly. The crowd parted to let us through, though I saw one or two cautious looks sent my way. The crowd around us murmured quietly as we passed and it slowly began to disperse. By the time we reached the little two story building, we only had a few ponies still following us. And they left when we went through the doors. I was holding Luna under my wing while Celestia stuck close to Starswirl. Everyone except for Tidy seemed to relax when we got inside.</p><p>“That was....interesting.” Misty looked around the main room. She went to land but winced when her foot touched the ground. “Hey uh, Tidy.” She looked over at the earth pony. “Would you happen to know where I could find a doctor? My leg is pretty messed up.” Tidy gasped when she saw her leg.</p><p>“Oh, you poor thing! What happened?” She ran up to Misty and started cradling her leg. Much to Misty’s discomfort.</p><p>“Uh, Timberwolf. Sooooooo where is the doctor?” She forcefully pulled her leg out of Tidy’s grip.</p><p>“Just down the road, it’s the building with the scalpel on the sign.” </p><p>“Thanks, and uh. Would you know where the blacksmith is too?” Misty asked.</p><p>“At the end of the same road.” With that, Misty flew out the door and went to get her leg healed. Now, if you will all follow me, I will show you to your rooms!” She happily pranced down a hallway forcing us to hurry after her.  She stopped in front of a door near the end of the hallway. “You two love birds can stay here.” She pointed at Bullseye and Stone Slab.</p><p>“What!? No, we’re not-!” Stone Slab started, while Bullseye just made a fish impression. Tidy moved to the door right across from it.</p><p>“You and your daughters are welcome to this room!” She told Starswirl.</p><p>“Thank you. We appreciate this very much.” Swirl thanked her.  The sisters smiled at her as well before they went into the room to rest. The mare looks at me nervously and led me to the last room.</p><p>“The only room big enough left is this one.” She stood by the plain white door. I reached out a talon to open it, but I stopped when she flinched. Instead I tried to use my telekinesis to open it. After a moment of concentration a black aura appeared around the handle. Giving it a twist, the door swung inwards to reveal a standard hotel room....for this time period. No plumbing and all that. Still had a bathroom, sink, and bedroom/living room. The mare looked around the hall for a minute before looking back at me. “Did you open the door?”</p><p>“Chirp.” I nodded my head. Her eyes got a little wider for a moment before she remembered something. </p><p>“Oh! Right. You’ll have to share this room with that pegasus from earlier. This is the only room I have left at the moment. Some ponies came into town yesterday and are using the other rooms.” <i>Yay....</i> I didn’t really mind. I would most likely be gone for a few hours anyway. I was getting hungry.</p><p>“Chirp!” I bowed my head at her in thanks. She quickly, and excitedly, walked away to the front desk. I looked at the room then shook my head and closed the door. I would rest later. I wasn’t really tired. I went down the hall and to the front room. Nodding to Tidy on the way out, I opened the front door and took off into the sky. Soaring away from the town was hard to do without attracting attention. Ponies below looked up as I flew by. I focused for a moment and my feathers appeared to burst into fire. I smirked as I heard several gasp from below. <i>I am fire. I am death.</i> I joked with myself.</p><p>Soon enough the town disappeared and was replaced by forest. Keeping an eye out, I searched for anything to eat. <i>It’s been awhile since I last ate. Or slept.</i> Pondering over my situation, I spotted something small moving through the woods below. I looked closer to see a white bunny running through the woods. I swooped down towards him as quietly as I could. Which was apparently pretty quiet. “KEEEEEEAAR!!!” I cried as I sunk my talons into it, blackening the flesh with frostbite. Sinking my beak into the dead animal was like a knife through hot butter. It tasted just as good as the last rabbit I ate. Some part of me was a little disturbed by eating raw rabbits. But it was quickly shoved aside. The red meat tasted amazing and I made short work of it. Leaving the pile on bones where they were for some animal to find, I took off. I flew back towards town until I noticed I had some blood on my beak. Diving down into a passing river quickly solved that problem. I resumed my journey back to the inn and spotted Misty going through town. She was heading to a building that was spewing smoke from a large chimney. <i>Must be the blacksmith. I’d like to see that actually.</i> Deciding to take a small detour, I headed down to meet up with Misty. She jumped a little as I landed beside her.</p><p>“Jeez! Fly a little louder would you? I’m gunna have a heart attack.” Misty scolded me. I smiled and just pointed at her leg. “Oh yeah, the doctor fixed it up! Good as new! The unicorns have one thing going for them, and that’s magic. It has its uses.”</p><p>“Chirp?” I pointed at the blacksmith.</p><p>“Yeah, I wouldn’t mind some company. I’m just going to get my blades repaired.” She opens her wing and showed her broken wing blades underneath. “Yeah, they took a beating. But they’ve been with me forever. So I’m not getting new ones till I destroy these.” She smiled at the blades. <i>She must really like those blades.</i> </p><p>We walked up to the entrance of the blacksmith. Loud bangs and clangs came from inside. The banging was followed by a loud hissing. Like water getter put on a fire. Misty knocked on the door and a voice yelled out. “Just a minute! I’ll be right there.” A moment later a large earth pony opened the door. He narrowed his eyes at Misty, and narrowed them even more when he saw me. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Well you see. I was hoping to get my wingblades fixed-.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What?” Misty got an angry look on her face.</p><p>“I said no. I ain’t fixing no blades for a pegasi and her weird pet. Now get going.” He said before slamming the door. <i>PET!? Oh come on! Where has this guy been the last few hours?</i> I walked up to the door, raised a talon and beat the door half to death. The same earth pony opened the door. “Now I’ve done said no!! Take your business else where!” I glared at him and levitated the wings blades over to me. “No.” He looked at Misty. “Now get your freaky bird away from here. Before I call the guard.”</p><p>“Oh come on!!” Misty was furious. “At least let us talk!!”</p><p>“I’m not fixing anything for a pegasus. Not ever.” The earth pony stated. Misty got a contemplative look on her face.</p><p>“What if we just used your forge? You wouldn’t have to do anything.” Misty asked. The earth pony thought about it.</p><p>“I don’t see why not. Good luck finding someone to work it though. I’m the only pony in town who knows how.” He smirked. “Now go on! Unless you find someone to work the forge your not allowed in here!” He promptly slammed the door.</p><p>“Great. How are we going to find someone to work the forge.” Misty looked around irritated.</p><p>“Chirp.” I pointed towards the inn. From what I remembered Silver Anvil was a blacksmith.</p><p>“Your right! Silver! I sorry for all the times I called you a feather brain in my head!” She took off towards the hotel. <i>Im not sure whether to be insulted or not.</i></p><hr/><p>An hour later saw us knocking at the door again. “Now Look here. I said don’t come back till you found a smith!”</p><p>“We did! This here is Silver Anvil. He was a smith back at my town!” Misty introduced Silver. Silver waved shyly at the big stallion.</p><p>“All right, fine. I suppose a deals a deal.” He visibly deflated. “It’d probably be quicker to just let you get it over with. Darn stubborn pegasi.” He moved aside and let us into the building. “But if you leave a mess, or break my tools, I’m billing you! With that he walked off to sit and grumble behind the main counter. We continued into the back of the shop where the big forge was.</p><p>“Here’s my blades Silver. Take care of them.” Misty gave her wing blades to Silver. A smile came onto his face as he took them in his magic. At the same time, half the tools lit up with his magic and the forge burst to life. He stuck the blades into the fire for awhile before pulling them out red hot. Tools began to fly around the room as he looked through them and chose which ones he would need. <i>Something tells me this is going to be interesting.</i></p>

<p>Watching Silver repair the blades was amazing. He pounded on the red hot metal with different tools. Fixed cracks and dents, even forging a new half for the broken blade. <i>This is awesome! Never thought I’d get to see something like this.</i> Me and Misty watched from the side of the shop as Silver worked at the forge. A few times the big stallion that owned the shop would come check on us, but other than that we were left alone. We learned the shop owners name was Heavy Set. I read it on a sign he had in the back. ‘Heavy Set’s Tools’. It looked like an old business sign. “So, how much longer will this take?” Misty asked for the fifth time. She fidgeted beside me as I sighed. <i>Be patient!!</i></p><p>“Caaw!” I shouted at her. I glared as she shrunk a little.</p><p>“Ok ok. I’ll be quiet.” She stopped talking......for five seconds. “So, how long does this USUALLY take?” Silver sagged a little as my feathers flashed red.</p><p>“Hey!” I looked up to see Heavy standing in the door way. “Do that again.” I looked around and then pointed at myself. “Yes you.” I shrugged and flashed my feathers red again. “How do you do that?”</p><p>“Chirp” </p><p>“Hmmm. Here, try this.” Heavy handed me a quill and some paper. <i>Uuuuh. How, do I use this.</i> I looked up at him. “Oh right. Here.” He pulled and ink pot from....somewhere. <i>That didn’t help.</i> I decided to bite the bullet and just try it. Levitating the quill, I dipped it in the ink. I started writing on the paper, and the result was surprisingly good. ‘Magic.’ Heavy looked at the paper and then back at me. “I know that ya dumb bird!” He face hoofed. Grumbling, he walked up to me and plucked a feather.</p><p>“Caaaw!!” I yelled at him.</p><p>“Oh hush ya baby.” Heavy looked closely at my feathers. “Hmmmm, this might work.”</p><p>“What?” Misty flew up,to look over his shoulder. “All I see is a magic feather.”</p><p>“That right. Magic.” Heavy glared at her. “I’m sure a guard pegasi has heard of enchanted weapons before. Unless the pegasi have lowered their guards standards even more.” Misty glared at him, puffing out steam.</p><p>“Why you little!” Misty looked ready to charge at him. I cleared my throat and tapped his shoulder.</p><p>“Chirp?” I pointed at the feather.</p><p>“Ah, yes.” Heavy turned towards me. “You see, I had tha chance to work with a phoenix feather a long time ago. Very rare, very special. Tha properties it put in the metal were nothing short of amazing. Steel was ten times stonger. It’s cuts burned and the blades never dulled. I was simply thinking about what your feather could do.” He got a contemplative look. “I think-.” He hesitated a moment. “I’ve heard of phoenixes before.” He continued. “But I’ve never heard of a creature like you. And if I got one chance in my life to work with a Phoenix feather, well, I’ll probly never get another chance for one of yours.” He stopped and looked directly at me. “I’d be willing to forge anything you want, if you’d let me have some feathers to work with. I would love to forge some enchanted weaponry again.” He looked longingly at the feather for a moment before his face hardened and he looked back at me. “Well? What do you say?” <i>Anything I want? For some feathers? That sounds like a good deal to me.</i></p><p>“Crrrrrrr.” <i>Ooh, that’s a new one.</i></p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes?” Heavy looked hopefully at me. I nodded my head. “Great! I’ll just get these down to the smeltery!” With that he reached over and yanked a few more feathers from me.</p><p>“Caaaw!!” He ran out of the house looking like a kid that just got candy. <i>I’m going to be featherless if this keeps up.</i></p><p>“Sooooo, now you two are business partners?” Misty had an extremely confused look on her face. “It seems like you got a really good deal. And I thought he was just a jerk.” Silver continued to hammer away in the back ground. Until he stopped anyway. Suddenly my wings were extended and a measuring tape held up to them.</p><p>“Chirp?” I looked over my shoulder at Silver.</p><p>“Keep still.” Silver surprised us by talking. <i>When the mute pony speaks, it must be important.</i> I stood as still as possible until he let my wings down and went back to hammering. </p><p>“Chirp?” He didn’t respond to my questioning bird noises. Instead he just kept hammering. I looked over at Misty.</p><p>“Do I look like a mind reader? Come on, I wanna see what’s happening at the Smeltery.” With that, Misty flew out the door. Literally.</p><hr/><p>“Hurry up! Geez!” Misty shouted from the doorway. I gave her an irritated look as I waited for the elderly pony in front of me to move. When they were out of the way I walked up to the Smeltery entrance. “About time.” Misty flew in ahead of me. I walked in just in time to hear Heavy talking to someone in the back.</p><p>“Is it ready?” Heavy asked.</p><p>“Would you calm down ya youngster. This takes time ya know.” An old mare replied. Me and Misty entered into the back room in time to see an earth pony mare carry a cast iron pot or molten metal over to Heavy. “There. That should work jus fine. Now mah payment? Steel isn’t cheap to make ya know. Especially this pure.”</p><p>“Yeah, here ya go.” Heavy hoofed over a good sized bag of what I’m assuming was bits. “Now, let’s get this started.” Me and Misty watched from the back as Heavy dropped one of my feathers into the red metal. Even Hilda watched with interest. Heavy grabbed a long metal rod from a rack and began to stir the feather in. Once it was completely submerged, a flash of blue light erupted from the pot. “Quick! Grab me those molds!” He pointed at me. I looked around the room until I found an open container full of molds. I flew over and grabbed them with my claws. Carrying them over was a chore. They were very heavy. “Thank you. Now back away please.” He shooed me away. He placed the molds he needed on the floor and began to poor the metal into them. The metal cooled unnaturally quick, and was left a silvery blue color. “Amazing. I can’t wait to see what this stuff does.”</p><p>“You don’t know what it does? But you made it? What if it, blows up or something?” Misty asked. Heavy’s happy look was replaced with one of irritation.</p><p>“That’s not how this type of enchantment works. One would think that a pegasus would know that. Especially one with a military background like yer’s.” Heavy responded. “I’ll be at the forge if you need me. Trying out this new metal. Maybe make you a REAL pair of wing blades.” Misty’s face turned red with anger at that comment.</p><p>“You little!” She flew after him. Only to hit the door when he shut it. “Aaarrrrgh!! I wanna kill him!” She kicked open the door and flew off to the hotel. I looked at the mare still in the room with me.</p><p>“You’ve got yer self quite the group yungun. Hehe. Hope you can rein em in.” Hilda chuckled to herself as she walked further into the building. <i>You have no idea. Now, after that ridiculously cool display, I think I’m going to sleep.</i> With that, I flew on to the hotel. <i>Can’t wait to see what that metal does.</i></p>

<p><b>BANG BANG BANG.</b> <i>What the heck!?</i> I shot up in the bed and looked at the door.</p><p>“Night! If you don’t open up right this second imma gunna bust the door down and pluck you bare!!” Heavy yelled through the door. <i>What?</i> I looked out the window to see it was still night time. Midnight judging by the moons position. <i>Alright. Let’s get this over with. I was almost asleep.</i> I walked over to the door and opened it with an unamused look on my face. “Look at this!! Isn’t it magnificent!!” He shoved a blue silver sword into my face. I looked at the weapon unamused and then pointed out the window.</p><p>“Chirp.” I glared at Heavy.</p><p>“Pssshh, who needs sleep when there’s forging to be done!? Especially with metal such as this!”</p><p>“Shut up you idiot!! We’re trying to sleep here!!!” Someone yelled from down the hall.</p><p>“What is going on!?” Misty groaned from the roof. We looked up to see her looking over the edge of her cloud bed. “Can’t you two be quiet!?” With that she rolled over and attempted to go back to sleep. Heavy had the decency to look sorry for a second before he turned serious again.</p><p>“After I forged a sword I decided to conduct an investigation as to identify tha properties of the metal.”</p><hr/><p><b>Flashback</b></p><p>“Hah!! Take that ya scurvy dogs!!” Heavy sliced a block of wood with the sword, shattering it into frozen pieces. “Avast maties!! Take arms against these pirates!!” Another block of wood fell. “Hahah!!! Take that you dastardly fiends!!” One more block of wood. “Hahaha!! Hahahahahaaaa!!!” Heavy stood in the middle of fifty broken wood blocks. All murdered in cold blood.</p><hr/><p><b>Present</b></p><p>“Anyways, after ah pla- TESTED the sword I didn’t have much else to do. So I started thinking about how hungry I was, which led to carrots. And that led to radishes, which led to the pretty mare that owns the fruit stand in the market.” I stared at Heavy. “Anyways, I was thinking about that mare, and THIS happened.” He held up the sword for me to see.</p><p>After a moment of nothing happening I was about to send him away. Until the surface of the blade shimmered. Once it cleared, it showed a mare sleeping in a bed somewhere. <i>What!? That’s amazing!!..... Can </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">I</span><i> do that? Wait a minute.</i> I gave Heavy a disapproving glare. “What!? I didn’t see anything I didn’t want to see!” <i>That was literally the least reassuring thing I’ve ever heard anyone ever say.</i> Shaking my head at him I looked stretched out one of my wings and looked at it. <i>Maybe...</i> I concentrated on what I wanted to see, and after a moment an image of a sleeping Luna appeared on my wing. <i>Oh that is amazing.</i></p><p>“Chirp!” I excitedly showed him my wing.</p><p>“Really? Of all the things you could scry, you chose tha little filly next door? Bah, your no fun.” Another glare went Heavy’s direction. “Welp, I’m gunna go back ta playi-testing the sword at my shop. See ya around.” With that he walked out and I shut the door behind him. While that could have waited till morning, I was glad he decided to show me now. <i>Now I have something to do tonight.</i> Apparently, space hawks didn’t sleep often. Which left me to stay awake all night. While I would have loved to be able to do that at home, I didn’t have internet here. So I had nothing to entertain myself with.</p><p>“Is he gone?” Misty looked over her cloud.</p><p>“Chirp.”</p><p>“Good. At least your quiet.” Misty rolled back over, and soon light snores filled the room. <i>Well, let’s see what I can do.</i> With that, I started trying to scry on everything I could think of. I was met with much disappointment when I couldn’t scry home. <i>Dang it!</i> I tried scry int the sisters and they came into view on my wing, along with Starswirl. I even tried scrying some timberwolves. When nothing appeared I got confused. <i>Maybe I need to be more specific?</i></p><p>This time I looked for the <b>closest</b> timberwolf. Imagine my surprise when a wolf appeared on my wing....right outside of town. I jumped up, ready for to run out the door. But I stopped when several arrows hit it and it fell apart. In the distance a few ponies cheered on the border of the town. <i>Wow, good shot.</i> Then I got an idea. What if I looked for the shadow creature? I got a little excited as I started to concentrate. After a moment of nothing happening I tried harder. Slowly but surely, an image came onto my wing. <i>WHAT THE-!!!</i> I froze as I saw the monster looking right at me. It walked closer to me. And closer. It sniffed at me as it stood right on the other side of my wing. Slowly the image on my wing dripped down my feathers and onto the floor. There the drops pooled together until they made a puddle showing the creature. It seemed to smile sinisterly before it slowly reached forward.</p><p>“KEEEEEEAR!!!!” I shrieked when it’s paw started to come through the puddle. I heard fumbling around from the rooms across the hall, but I knew they would get here in time. I tried to close the portal by ending the scry. But it wouldnt respond. I tried harder and harder. By now the creature had got all of one front leg in. Right as it tried to slash forward at me, a lot of things happened. The door burst open as the paw flew at me. Misty finally got up and saw what was happening. And I managed to close the portal.</p><p>“SCREEEEEEEEEEEEeeeee!!!!” The sound came from impossibly far away, yet seemed as clear as day. Everyone was froze as we stared at where a single black paw lay.</p><p>“What in the world is going on!?” Starswirl asked angrily. Not that I could blame him.</p><p>“It’s ok, it’s ok. It’s not here. It’s not really here.” Misty sat in the corner whimpering to herself. The sisters were behind Star, looking terrified. And I was in the middle of the room next to the paw. <i>What did I </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">do</span><i>?</i> I asked myself as I stared at the disembodied limb. <i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i> I quoted.</p>

<p>We all stared at the limb on the floor. It still twitched from time to time as a mist of shadows seeped out of it. “Do I even <b>want</b> to know?” Bullseye asked as he stood in the doorway.</p><p>“Probably not.” His sister answered. Everyone one flinched as the leg twitched once again. Misty was rocking back and forth in the corner and muttering to herself. I slowly left my spot on the floor and sat beside her. As I wrapped my wing around her she leaned into me and stopped shivering.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say!!” Starswirl looked furious and confused. “Why would you be so reckless!” I opened my mouth to explain but remembered that wouldn't work. I sighed and levitated a peice of paper and an inkwell from a desk in the corner. I pulled out a feather and dipped it in ink. ‘I didn't mean to! I just meant to find it.’ I wrote. Starswirl sighed a rubbed his forehead. “Ok, ok. It was a mistake. You didnt know it could do that. And I didn't tell you.” He looked back at the limb on the ground and rubbed his head again. “We need to get rid of this before someone finds it.” Starswirl's horn lit up and with a POP the limb disappeared. “There! Now it’s gone. I’m going back to bed. We leave early tomorrow.” With that he walked back to his room. Celestia nervously followed him while Luna came over to me.</p><p>“Its ok. It was an accident!” She hugged me then hurried out the door. <i>Adorable.</i></p><p>“Soooo. Ya need anything?” Bullseye asked awkwardly. I just shook my head and him and his sister walked out the door.</p><p>“What happened!!?? Is everything....ok?” Healing and Lavender stopped at the door and stared at the mess in the room. Me practically cradling Misty, the scratches on the floor, and the small spots of dark blood. “What happened!?” Lavender screeched.</p><p>“Sorry it took us so long, we were at the other end of the building.” Healing apologized. “Are you hurt?” I shook my head. “And her?” Again, i shook my head. “Do you need anything? All we heard was screaming.” I simply waved to the door and layed my head on the wall. “Ok. Ok, try to get some sleep. Tell us what happened in the morning.” They left slowly, looking unsure about leaving. <i>This is gunna be a long night.</i></p><hr/><p>Sometime during the night i realized something. I missed video games. Theres only so much you can do for a whole night while your holding someone else. Speaking of someone else. Misty had finally fallen asleep. I guess she was more shook up about the attack on the town than we knew. Alot more. She cried for a long time before she started just sniffling. That town was her home, and the thing destroyed it. <i>I would be pretty sad to.</i> I had rocked her to sleep, so now all i could do was stare at the wall and drift through my thoughts. And even that wasnt entertaining. <i>Oh my god...I have never wanted the sun to rise more than I do now.</i> Such a long night ahead....</p>

					</header>


<p>We left early that morning. To early for everyone except Starswirl. “I would love to be SLEEPING right now!! But Instead we’re walking through the woods at-“ Bullseye looked at the sky. “-At too early!!”</p><p>“Would you PLEASE stop complaining.” Swirl asked from the front. “I assure you I am more tired than you, so I would like a little calm for a few hours. If at all possible.” Starswirl had an irritated expression on his face. He had his horn lit, and was waving his head back and forth. It seemed to glow brighter every time he pointed it West. He turned to walk in the direction it glowed the brightest. </p><p>As we all followed him I felt a tap on my shoulder. I looked over to see Silver holding a bag out to me. I grabbed it in my magic and was surprised by the light weight of the large bag. “For you.” That was all he said before he fell to the back of the group again. I looked at the bag, then at Misty. She was under my right wing. She was still shook up. Not as bad, but she shivered every once in a while.</p><p>“-My opinion, Aloe and Honey is the best treatment for burns.” Lavender.</p><p>“Well, yes. But that’s not counting magic. Magic is better than any natural remedy by a long shot.” Healing responded.</p><p>“But in the case your magic doesn’t work? Or there’s no unicorns?”</p><p>“Then yes, I have to agree. Honey and Aloe ARE very good remedies.” Healing responded. It was good to here a calm conversation between two beings comparing notes. We hadn’t had much calm in the past few days.</p><p>“Can you get off of me? I’m hot.” Misty whispered from beside me. I looked over and immediately took my wing off her. Luna came running up to us ad looked at Misty.</p><p>“Are you better Misty?” She asked in her cute, innocent voice. “I hope so. Other wise, who is Night gunna fly With? He likes flying a lot, and so do you!” Misty showed a small smile at that and nodded.</p><p>“Yes, I’m a little better. I just need a little rest.” Luna ran off happily to see Swirl, and likely update him on Misty’s condition. It hurt me to see the normally proud pegasus brought so low. “I’m sorry Night, I shouldn’t have let you see me like this.” I shook my head at her.</p><p>“Purrrrrrr.” I let out a comforting noise. I think.</p><p>“I just got emotional after being so close to that...thing.” She shivered again and I started to extend my wing. She shied away from me and continued. “It killed them. All the other guards. Ponies I’d known for most of my life. And the Captain...” She let out a sob and fell into me. “It ate the Captain. She was like my mother. She had always been there for me, and I couldn’t save her.” She started sobbing into my feathers. I slowed down a little and squeezed her with my wing.</p><p>“Will she be ok?” Stone asked. She and everyone else had slowed down with me and had grim expressions. I just looked at Misty. I couldn’t answer even if I HAD and answer. We all just walked slowly toward wherever we were going.</p><hr/><p>Misty had long stopped crying. Now she was just wrapped under my wing as we walked through the woods. We seemed to be endlessly walking, just trees ,trees , and more trees. We didn’t hear anything nor see anything in the woods. Just the sound of hooves and breathing. <i>Where are we going?</i> “Chirp!?” I called up to Starswirl, who was in deep concentration. I promptly got a scroll and ink well thrown in my face. After rubbing my sore beak, I glared at Swirl as I pulled out a feather. <i>I'm going to be featherless at this rate.</i> ‘Where are we going?’ I wrote down. I threw the rolled up scroll into the back of Swirl’s head.</p><p>“Hey!” He hollered back. I just looked innocently at the sky. “Darn avian.” He looked at the scroll and facehoofed. “I have NO idea. Ok? I am just following an obscure trail of magic that is miles away, and several days old, through a forest I do not know, leading to a place I do not know.” Ok then. He has no idea. “Is there anyway you can fly up and look around? That would be wonderful.” He said in a tired voice. I looked down at Misty, and she looked back up and nodded. With a sigh I took off to scout around.</p><p>As I rose up into the air, I noticed that there wasn’t much besides trees in the area. It’s was also turning dark quickly. In the coming darkness my eyes started playing tricks on me. I saw dark shapes moving in the corner of my eyes, only to see nothing when I turned to look. <i>HA!</i> I whipped my head to look at what I was sure was movement. <i>Oh. Nothing.</i> A few more minutes went by with me seeing things. <i>HA! Oh, never mind.</i> This cycle repeated itself as I slowly went stir crazy. I started getting twitchy as I tried to look everywhere at once. <i>HA!!</i> I swung around to look at a shadow. <i>Oh, there’s not-</i> “KEEEAAAAR!!!” I dove down as the movement kept going in the woods breaking through the tree tops, I landed on the back of a.......nothing. There was nothing. I quickly took off and frantically made my way back to the group.</p><p>I landed with a thump beside the group. The others jumped at my landing while I looked around for Swirl. “You noticed to?” Swirl asked.</p><p>“Chirp!” I nodded frantically as I jumped at every rustle of leaves.</p><p>“What? What did he notice?” Bullseye asked nervously. As Swirl started to answer, Misty interrupted him suddenly. With a barley perceptible voice, she answered bullseyes’s question.</p><p>“We’re being followed.”</p>

<p>We tried to walk as far as we could through the forest, but eventually we had to rest. With the ever present ‘twitchy shadows’ no one was going to sleep. But at least we could all sit down around the fire for awhile. Well, if we HAD a fire. That’s what we were currently working on. “There! That should be plenty of wood for a fire! Light it up Swirly!” Stone Slab told Starswirl.</p><p>“If you ever call me ‘Swirly’ again....I don’t know what I’ll do but you won’t like it.” Swirl tiredly spoke back. With a strained face, and a few seconds of effort, a spark jumped from Swirl’s horn and lit the pile of wood. The logs and twigs quickly caught fire and lit the area.</p><p>With the immediate area lit up our group relaxed a little. Just a little. “So, do you have any idea what those things are out there?” Healing asked Starswirl.</p><p>“Irritating.” Bullseye stated flatly.</p><p>“No, I don’t. Why do you think I would know?” Swirl asked.</p><p>“Well, you just seem well traveled. And you know some things other unicorns don’t, like that spell you saved us with.” Healing answered. “And I’m just trying to start a conversation. It would be much less stressful if we were talking.”</p><p>“Chirp!” I agreed. I was extremely stressed right now.</p><p>“Ooh Ooh! Could we play a game!?” Luna asked adorably. Meanwhile Bullseye was chucking random sticks and stones into the woods. This stopped when a stone came back out and hit him in the head.</p><p>“Hey!!” He yelled, grabbing our attention. “Your gunna pay for that!” He picked up a random object around him, which happened to be a apple, and threw it into the woods. It seemed to disintegrate as it touched the darkness. Bullseye quickly sat down and scooted away from the shadows. “Yeah! I’ll teach you that lesson later!! Just wait!”</p><p>“Hey! That looks fun!” Luna picked up a berry from a bush, and threw it into the woods. Again it disintegrated as it touched the shadows. <i>It’s like that one Doctor Who episode.</i> I pondered the similarities for a minute before Swirl brought me from my thoughts.</p><p>“Luna! Stop! We don’t know what’s out there. We don’t want to antagonize it.” Swirl grabbed the berries from Luna and brought them to the fire. “Besides, we can eat these for dinner.”</p><p>“Ok, fine.” Luna huffed. “I wanna play a game though.”</p><p>“What do you want to play Luna?” Celestia asked.</p><p>“I don’t know......Ooh! Maybe Night knows a game!” Luna pointed at me. Swirl hid a laugh and looked at me.</p><p>“Well Night? Do you know any games?” Swirl chuckled at me. <i>I know </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">lots</span><i>of games. I just don’t have anything to play them on.</i> It would be nice if I had my PlayStation. Or IPad. <i>Hey! Maybe I can make a game with these!</i> I looked at my feathers. <i>Of course I can. Magic can do anything!</i> It probably couldn’t actually do anything. But a man bird thing can dream!</p><p>“Caw!” I announced at Swirl.</p><p>“Here! I brought parchment for a reason you know. For you to write on.” Swirl pulled some paper from his saddle bag and tossed it to me. I caught it in my magic and pulled out a feather. I looked expectantly at Swirl and he sighed before tossing me an inkwell. <i>Thank you.</i> ‘As a matter of fact, I <b>do</b> know a few games.’ Now I just needed to think of one to play on feathers. <i>Maybe spot the difference? A jigsaw puzzle? No, I’m to tired for that right now. I haven’t had </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">that</span><i>much practice.</i> “Well? What games do giant birds play?” Swirl asked with a hint of actual curiosity. I grabbed the parchment and wrote ‘Spot the difference.’ I opened my wings and laid back. On both wings I made an identical image of an underwater scene. I put some fish in and a few old looking wrecks. But of course, each picture had a few small things different in it.</p><p>“That’s sounds fun!” Luna rushed up and stepped on my wing to get a closer look. I winced and Celestia pulled her off.</p><p>“Hmmm. This could be interesting. Let’s try to find everything Luna.” Celestia sat down by my head and looked at my wings. Luna sat down beside her And scrunched her face in concentration. “There! This picture has a small blue dish at the bottom. The other one doesn’t.”</p><p>“Wow! Your good Tia!” Luna exclaimed. I made the fish flash before it faded out of the picture. “Hmmm. There! That ship wreck has two......things. The other one only has one!”</p><p>“That’s a mast Luna. It holds the sail.” Explained Celestia. I made the extra mast flash before fading away. While Luna and Celestia played the game, I grabbed the bag Silver had given me earlier. <i>What secrets do you hold?</i> I opened the bag and levitated the contents out. My eyes widened at the beautiful wing blades that slipped out. <i>Woah!</i> They were a silvery blue color, and they looked sharp enough to split a hair. The blades were segmented where they covered the alula so it could still move, and they only went from the elbow out. “Wow! Did you make those Silver!?” Celestia turned to look at Silver, who nodded shyly. Luna was looking at her reflection in one of the blades while I put on the other one. It slid over my wing snugly and wrapped around the bones slightly so it didn’t fall off.</p><p>“Aaaah. That was fun!” Luna said as I took the other blade and put it on as well. They both fit perfectly and I looked over at Silver with a thankful look in my eyes. ‘Thank you.’ I wrote on the paper. <i>I wonder...</i> I concentrated on what I wanted and the blades shimmered for a second. When the shimmering stopped, the blades showed Starswirl by the fire. “Hey!! That’s Starswirl! How’d he get in there!?”</p><p>“Hmmm. So that’s what Heavy was yelling about. That is really something.” Swirl said as he looked at me from his spot by the fire. “Even more interesting is the fact I can’t feel myself being scried. Everyone working for the Unicorn University was trained in Scy detection.”</p><p>“You can’t detect it Starswirl? But your the most powerful wizard ever!” Celestia said is disbelief.</p><p>“Hah!!” Swirl laughed. “I am by no means the most powerful wizard. Nor am I <b>close</b> to being the most powerful. The unicorns who raised the sun and moon? Now <b>they</b> were powerful. And there are other unicorns not as powerful as them, but still more so than me.”</p><p>“Then how do you do all of your amazing spells!? You must be powerful to make all these new ways to use magic!”</p><p>“Because, the powerful unicorns who had high positions in the university were stupid. They saw no need to make new magic. They were powerful with the spells they had, so why make more. They saw no need for improvement.” Swirl looked into the fire. “I had the honor of working with some of the elder magicians. Nothing serious, just organizing papers, helping with formulas. I tried many times to tell them there were other ways to use magic. But I was not at their level of strength, so I knew nothing. Or so they thought. So I tried to show them a new spell I made.” Swirl looked saddened for a moment. “They got rid of me after that. So I left the unicorn capital and set out to explore the world. And make new spells along the way.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Celestia said.</p><p>“It is not your fault. It is mine for thinking everyone wants to learn new things.”</p><p>“Well, they weren’t smart!” Luna shouted “They lost the best wizard ever!”</p><p>“Uh, guys?” Bullseye said. “I may or may not have hit something and made it angry.” We all looked over to see the darkness slowly closing in. The camp fire stopped producing light even though it was still lit. Kind of like in the hobbit, when Gandalf gets mad in Bilbo’s house and the lights dim. Except more terrifying because it was <b>actually happening</b>.</p><p>“What did you do!?” Swirl yelled.</p><p>“Uuuuh. Throw a large rock at a snapping twig?” Bullseye looked guilty. “I panicked ok!?”</p><p>“I’m not comfortable with how close it is!!” Lavender yelled. Suddenly the darkness surged forward and the other all screamed. I was thrown to the ground by something and landed on my back. A dark silhouette stood over me. It seemed to open its mouth before throwing its head forward to bite my neck. Or it would have if a trendle of shadow didn’t slap it across the face.</p><p>“No!” Luna yelled as she slapped it again. “I’m not losing my friend again!” She slapped it again as it seemed to be stunned. The slap seemed to bring it back to reality and it made several high pitch squeaking sounds before it flew off, with the sound of others leaving as well. As soon as their wing beats disappeared the area around the fire lit up again like someone flipped a switch.</p><p>“What was that!?” Stone slab asked loudly. ‘I’m done with this forest.’ I wrote on the paper.</p><p>“I with you there.” Healing responded.</p><p>“I do not know. But as soon as the sun rises we are leaving.” Swirl stated. <i>This is gunna be a long night.</i></p>

<p>“Goodbye forever!!” Bullseye yelled at the forest happily. We made it out of the dark forest early in the morning. Now the trees were much thinner. The sun was just barely above the horizon and the sky was almost cloudless.</p><p>“I have to agree with you there brother.” Stone slab responded, “I’ll be happy if we never have to go in there again.” She shivered a little.</p><p>“It wasn’t so bad!” Luna said.</p><p>“Says the mare who can control shadows. In a dark forest.” Healing stated.</p><p>“Where did you learn that spell Luna?” Swirl asked.</p><p>“Night was reading about it when he watched me! It was really boring.”</p><p>“You need to be careful Luna. You may not be ready for all the spells in those books yet. You may get hurt.” Celestia looked at Luna with a worried expression.</p><p>“I must agree with your sister, I have seen many injured unicorns come into my home. A lot of them hurt by spells they weren’t careful with.” Lavender explained.</p><p>“Yes Luna, while we are grateful for you saving Night, please only use unfamiliar spell in a emergency.” Swirl looked back at Luna. “Ok?” Luna looked at the ground.</p><p>“Yes Starswirl.” Luna walked over to me and leaned against me as we walked.</p><p>“Hey.” Misty whispered to Luna. “I think you did great. Better than most mages I’ve seen.” Luna perked up and smiled at her.</p><p>“Thanks!”</p><p>“No problem kid.” Misty leaned back against me, looking a little happier. I grabbed some writing supplies from Swirl’s bags and wrote ‘any idea where we’re going?’ I floated it over to Swirl for him to read.</p><p>“No, I have no idea. I am simply following this magic trail.” Swirl looked thoughtful for a moment. “However, judging by the wound you inflicted on the creature, we may be headed to its home. Which means we will be at a disadvantage.” He opened up his bags. “However.” He smirked for a second. “We have these.” He pulled out the Elements. They shimmered almost happily in the early morning sun. Six gems, all perfectly cut and sized. I just had one question. ‘Where did they come from?’ I asked in the scroll. “They were a gift from harmony itself. They come from a crystal tree, one I have studied and determined to be a manifestation of harmony. We were lead to it by a strange magic signature after Discord’s reign started. It gave us these gems as a weapon against him. And now I plan for us to use them against the beast.” <i>And now I know how the Elements were found. If only I could brag about this back home.</i> Swirl looked around for a minute before saying something else. “Can you scout the area and see what is around? I do not want to stumble upon anything dangerous.” Nodding to him I took off and rapidly climbed into the sky. After a minute or two a second pair of wings joined my own.</p><p>“I figured I’d join you. You know, to make sure you don’t miss anything.” Misty smiled thinly at me. I smiled back as much as a bird could. Which was a lot in Equestria......apparently. </p><p>We soared in the air as we scouted around. A few squirrels and rabbits here and there. A river there. A deep valley here. Nothing to interesting. I circled around the group to keep an eye out for anything dangerous. As I made a loop, I saw a darker than normal shadow further behind our group. I blinked and it was gone. <i>Just stay away from us and I won’t mess with you.</i> I circled around again and continued patrolling with Misty.</p><p>After awhile of calm flying Misty flew up beside me. “Hey.” She got my attention. “I wanted to say......thanks. For staying with me and stuff. Just that helped me feel better. So. Yeah.....thanks.” With a grumble she flew away to look around some more. I smiled a little at her as she left. <i>No problem Misty.</i> I looked down at Swirl and flashed the feathers on my stomach bright green to let him know everything was good. I was feeling hungry so I veered off course and went further from the group. I scanned the trees for any small animals that I could catch. <i>Don't take it personally squirrel. It just business.......lord business.</i> I chuckled at myself as I dove down to grab the squirrel. I broke through some small branches and grabbed it off the branch before rolling along the ground. I bit into it’s neck to kill it quickly. Then I dug into it as fast as I could. <i>This is delicious. I’m probably enjoying this to much but it’s so good!</i> “So, you even hunt like a bird to?” Misty said from beside me. </p><p>“KEEEAAAAAR!! <i>Arg!! Oh my! Yoooooooooou scared the mess out of me!!</i> I held a claw to my chest and calmed myself down before glaring at her. Then I realized there was a half eaten squirrel carcass beside me and I discreetly stepped in front of it.</p><p>“What? Afraid I’ll steal your squirrel? No thanks, I’ll stick with whatever I threw into my bags. Something green.” When I didn’t move and continue eating she huffed and sat down. “I’ve seen a dead squirrel before. Heck, I’ve seen dead ponies. I’m a guard.” With that she pulled of her saddle bags and set them in front of her. She opened them and pulled out an apple. She looked back up at me. “Don’t let me interrupt your meal. I was just eating my own lunch.” With that she laid down and began eating her apple like nothing was wrong. <i>Man, ponies are different now.</i> I hesitantly moved back and started eating what was left of my squirrel. After a few bites Misty started talking again.</p><p>“So, do you always eat squirrels? Or do you eat helpless little bunnies to?” I choked a little and she started laughing. “HA! The look on your face! I’m just messing with you, loosen up.” She took a bite of her apple with a crunch and chewed as she thought of what to say next. “So, where are you from? I’m from Cloudsdale, a little cloud village in the middle of nowhere. Literally, nothing but forest for miles.” Again, I choked a little. <i>Little village? Cloudsdale? Wow, you’d never believe what it turned into.</i> when I didn’t answer she nodded. “Right, not a big talker. Here, I grabbed some paper.” She tossed a roll of paper at me and I caught it in my kinesis. ‘I’m from far away.’ I sent it back to her. After reading it she huffed. “Obviously. How far?” I put my wings together and pulled them apart in a ‘this big’ motion. “Really far huh? Maybe over the oceans? We haven’t explored over there yet. Maybe someday I’ll get to go over there. Always wanted to cross an ocean. Never had the time though.” She took another bite of apple. The last bite to be exact. “Welp, I’m done eating. See you in the sky.” She took off in a cloud of dust, leaving me to finish the last few bites of my squirrel. <i>Who does she remind me of?</i> I shrugged and finished my squirrel. I took to the sky and continued my path around our group. I spotted the shadow for a second, but it was still far away. <i>Sneaky little thing. Your on the other side of us now. I’m watching for you.</i></p>

<p>We knew we were there by the trees. On minute we were walking in a pleasant, thinly wooded area. The next the trees grew close together with barely enough room to squeeze through the. They were neither tall nor short and the trunks were black and twisted. “So uh....who wants to go first?” Stone asked.</p><p>“None of you are going.” Swirl replied. “Just Celestia, Luna, and I. It’s to risky to bring all of you.”</p><p>“What!? You aren’t gong to be able to defend yourselves in there!” Misty hollered.</p><p>“What she said.” Bullseye said in the background. I don’t think anyone heard him.</p><p>“At least take someone with you!” Misty yelled. Swirl looked at the ground for a moment.</p><p>“Fine. Nightwing, your coming to.” <i>Yay? I’m not sure if I’m supposed to be happy or not.</i> Misty looked a little upset at that.</p><p>“That’s it? Just him?”</p><p>“Well do you want to come as well!?” Swirl glared at her. “I can not risk you freezing up in there! I am risking as few lives as possible!” Lavender took this moment to intervene.</p><p>“Misty, while I’m sure you want to go with them, Starswirl is right. You would freeze up again. And we may only get in the way!” She sent a pity filled look at Misty. “I understand you want to help. Stay here and help me get a little clinic set up. With the amount of trouble these ponies get into, we may need a whole hospital when they get back.” She sent a good natured smile at us while Misty just looked at the ground in shame. “Please be careful in there. Enough lives have been lost recently.”</p><p>“To many lives. While I don’t like it, I’ll stay here and wait. If any thing comes this way I’ll keep them safe.” Bullseye motioned at the ones staying behind.</p><p>“That’s my brothers way of saying be careful. And good luck.” Stoneslab smirked at Bullseye. “Show that thing what for, ya hear?”</p><p>“Indeed. And I’ll be here when you all need a pain spell. I’m sure you’ll be sore after this.” Healing added in. Silver stood off to the side a little and smiled at us.</p><p>“Be safe.” Was all he said. I noticed he looked at Celestia more than anyone else.</p><p>“Alright, we will try to be back by morning at the latest. If we are not back by then...it may be safer if you all left.” With that, Swirl turned and walked into the woods.</p><p>“See you soon!” Luna happily waved goodbye before hopping into the darkness. Celestia just looked at Silver before following.</p><p>“Chirp!” I started walking into the forest before something wrapped around my neck. I looked to the side to see Misty hugging me. </p><p>“Please be safe. I would rather keep all my friends alive.” With that she let go and backed away, trying to look like she didn’t just hug me. “So. Yeah. You better come back safe! All of you!” She looked at the ground for a moment. “I’m getting fire wood!” With that she flew away from the dark forest to grab some wood. I waved my wing at the remaining ponies and squeezed through the outer trees. </p><p>Once inside all light seemed to disappear. I could barely see Starswirl and the sisters ahead of me. I caught up to them and enjoyed the small area of light that Swirl's horn produced. The trees on either side of us were extremely close, leaving almost no room to walk. <i>We won’t be flying out, that’s for sure.</i> There was next to no underbrush, only thin, dead looking bushes. No small animals ran through the woods and it seemed the whole forest was dead. Especially when Swirl's horn went out. </p><p>“What!?” Swirl looked at his horn as It started flickering. “The darkness is to strong for me to use my magic here. This forest is full of dark magic.” He stopped for a second as his horn went out completely. </p><p>“Are you sure about this Starswirl?” Celestia asked. “Maybe we should go back and plan this better?”</p><p>“No, we need to finish this. This creature has been a scourge on the land for to long. We need to be rid of it as soon as possible.” Swirl tried to light his horn but it only shot out a few sparks. Then the breathing started. It wasn’t loud. It was almost as if the whole <b>forest</b> was breathing. A barely perceptible wave of air going into the heart of the forest, then a few seconds later coming back out. In and out. In and out. And yet it wasn’t air. None of the leaves moved and none of the bushes were disturbed. <i>Oh man. This just got </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">waaaaaay</span><i> to creepy.</i> “All that dark magic. You can physically feel it.” He shiver for a moment. “We need to hurry. If we stay to long the magic could start to effect us in...unpleasant ways.” Swirl started moving deeper into the forest with us close behind.</p><p>We stepped over dead logs laying in the path and deep holes here and there. There was no straight path through the dark. The dark wasn’t a problem for much longer however. As we went deeper a yellow light began to shine through the trees, or from the trees. I couldn’t tell. The light wasn’t much but it was enough to navigate by. And add to the creep factor. As we walked Swirl stumbled and dropped to his front knees.</p><p>“Starswirl!” Yelled Celestia.</p><p>“Are you ok!?” Asked Luna. I cringed and looked around after their loud yelling.</p><p>“I am fine. But the magic is already effecting me. I suspect you have longer due to your more durable bodies. We need to hurry.” Swirl stood back up and pushed forward once more. I moved to follow but snapped my head to the left to look through the trees. But nothing was there. <i>This place is terrifying.</i> I followed the others quickly so I didn’t get left behind. </p><hr/><p>An hour later something changed. The air got three times heavier and the yellow light blinked out of existence. Silence filled our group as we quit walking. A shuffle sounded to the right and our heads snapped over to look. Another shuffle to the left. Another ahead of us. “Its right by us Starswirl.” Celestia whispered to him.</p><p>“I know. Here.” He handed them the elements and they grabbed them in their hooves. They both touched them to their horns and the Elements changed into rings that they slipped onto their horns. Three for each sister. </p><p>Luna slipped the Elements for Loyalty, Laugher, and Honesty. While Celestia put on Kindness, Generosity, and Magic. Just in time for the rustling to stop.  Giant jaws leapt out of the brush to try and latch onto my neck. Suffice to say they missed.</p><p>I spun around the teeth and hit the beast on the back of the head with a wing. Then I slashed at him with my new blades. It jumped up just in time to dodge my attack. It grabbed me with it’s mouth and threw me into a nearby tree. It stalked forward to finish me off and I noticed he wasn’t missing a leg anymore. </p><p>Suddenly bolt of white magic hit it in the back of its head. “Foul beast!! To the grave with you!!” Again a bolt of white magic hit the creature causing him to stumble and growl. He decided that Starswirl was more important than revenge at the moment. He kept at Swirl and slapped him into the woods, out of sight. Then it leapt with open jaws at Luna.</p><p>“Never!” Celestia shouted and jumped in front of her sister. She threw up a shield that the creature face planted into. “Take that!” It did take it. Very well in fact. It almost seemed to grin as it bit into her shield. Then it made a pulling motion with it’s head. “Aaah! You foul creature! It’s draining my magic!”</p><p>Celestia’s shield grew dimmer while the shadows leaking from the creature started whipping around with energy. Finally the shield cracked and shattered. The creature almost seemed to laugh as it’s eyes began to glow a dark yellow. Celestia, to weak to evade, was hit by the giant foot of the creature. It walked up to a shivering Luna and opened up its mouth. <i>NOOO!!</i> “KEEEEEAR!!” I shrieked as I managed to stand up and throw myself at the beast. But I was to slow. The jaws closed around Luna’s neck getting ever closer to the skin. Until a dark blur smacked into its side. </p><p>“Squuueak!!” A high pitched bat like sound came from the blur. “Have at thee creature of darkness!!” A female voice also came from the blur. <i>Wait. Bat sounds? Is that a-?</i> A dark colored pegasus stood up from on top of the beast. Except it had bat wings instead of feathered ones. The batpony pulled a sword from a sheath on its side and stabbed it into the creature. “HA!! Take that!!” The beast threw her off and lunged for her. I intercepted it much to its irritation. <i>How about round two buddy?</i></p><p>“KEEEEAAAR!!” I shrieked at it before I bit into its neck with my sharp beak. The area around the bite turned black with frostbite.</p><p>“RAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!!” The beast roared in pain. I continued my onslaught by dragging my claws through his flesh as I swung onto his back. I saw Celestia emerge from the woods and run to Luna. <i>Get ready you two!</i>  I flashed my feathers green at them and continued fighting the beast onto the ground. I wrapped myself around it’s legs as best I could. From the corner of my eye I saw a bright light building. I was kind of preoccupied by the teeth snapping an inch from my face. <i>Well, he’s already mad. Yolo.</i> I quickly reached forward and bit into the underside of his jaw.</p><p>“Night! Move!” Celestia yelled. <i>Aaaand that’s my cue.</i> I released myself from the beast and threw myself away as the light reached maximum level behind me. But the creature wasn’t going down without a fight. It grabbed my leg and pulled me back onto the ground. I landed on my back so I could see the Rainbow headed for us both. <i>Yep. I shouldn’t have expected anything else.</i> Then the laser hit.</p>

<p>I woke up in the area where Twilight got alicorned. You know, the expanse of stars with the invisible floor. “So. You’ve finally done it.” A voice whispered all around me. “Thank you for destroying the darkness.” </p><p>“Who are you? Wait, I can talk! Yes! I’ve had so much I’ve wanted to say!” I shouted with joy.</p><p>“I am Harmony, I am glad to finally meet you face to face.” The voice whispered in return. “I am sorry about the circumstances surrounding your arrival. I truly am.” </p><p>“What do you mean? What circumstances?”</p><p>“Ah yesss, I almost forgot.” A thin thread light emerged in front of me and touched my head. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Rememberrrr.</span></p><hr/><p>I stood before a burning wreck on the road. The firemen had just arrived to put out the fire. The whole area was lit up in an orange glow that fought against the dark of night. <i>So that’s it then. Their gone.</i> My whole family had been in the car. I couldn’t seem to feel anything but numbness as the car burned in front of me. The hot metal hissed as the fire hoses try to put out the inferno. </p><p>A police officer came over to me with a sad look on his face, “I am so sorry for your loss. Would you like to stay and watch them get pulled out?” I didn’t think I could stand to see that. I simply shook my head. “Come on, I’ll get someone to drive you home sir.” He took me over to a police car with a women sitting in the driver seat. “This is Monica. Just tell her where you live and she’ll get you there ok?” I just nodded and slipped into the back of the car. </p><p>“What’s your address sir?” Monica asked sadly.</p><p>“4578 Maple Road.” I replied, barely above a whisper.</p><p>“You got it.”</p><hr/><p>I had been a week since the wreck. Every time I walked through the house I winced at the lack of people. <i>I need to get out of this house. Maybe go on vacation? I’m off of work for a month, I might as well.</i> Just as I went to look up vacation places on my PC, a knock came from the door. “Who could that be?” I cocked an eyebrow and made my way to the door. “Hello?” I opened the door to see a women standing there. A surprisingly tall women. I was six foot three and she stood even with me. She had pale skin and shiny blue hair. It almost looked transparent.</p><p>“Hello! My name is Harmony! Nice to see you today! Our company was simply offering these vacation slips to anyone we could find at home. We’re trying to get our name out there.” She handed me a slip of paper. “In this brochure you will find several very popular locations for a vacation. And all for a low price!” She smiled brightly. “I’ll just leave this brochure with you. If you want to choose a spot simply call the number on the back of the paper.” Which that she walked away.</p><p>“Well, that was convenient.” I stated after I shut the door. I went and sat on the couch while I read through the locations. And they were <b>really</b> cheap. “Twenty bucks for an island getaway? These prices are ridiculously cheap.”</p><hr/><p>After two days of holding myself back I had finally had enough. “I’m calling now!” I yelled at my hand as it refused to grab the phone. “Fine! Be that way!” I through my self forward onto the coffee table so I could grab the phone. I emerged victorious from the splintered remains of cheap furniture. I swiftly dialed the number and waited for someone to answer.</p><p>“Hello?” Someone answered the phone.</p><p>“Yes, I got your vacation brochure and I wanted to ask about it.”</p><p>“Which location would you like to ask about?” Her voice sounded familiar.</p><p>“The uh.” I picked up the brochure. “The magical forest getaway.” It seemed nice.</p><p>“Very nice choice! Are you sure that’s where you want to go?”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>“Wonderful! I’ll send you right away!” What?</p><p>“What do you mean-“ Darkness......</p><hr/><p>My head jerked back as I remembered things I had forgotten. It felt like a punch to the gut. “I am sorry for the removal of your memories, but I need you to be undistracted while the Darkness still roamed. Alas, the memories are not all I altered. I made a few permanent changes to your mind to better inhabit a different body.”</p><p>“Wha...” I had no words. This thing messed with my brain!?</p><p>“I also removed some of your....softer nature. I don’t wont you to starve because you feel bad when you kill animals.”</p><p>“What!?”</p><p>“Oh don’t worry. I didn’t remove your remorse of killing things. Just unintelligent animals. And only for food. You won’t enjoy killing now, if that’s what your worried about.” Harmony whispered at me.</p><p>“Yes, I am worried about it! What else did you change!?” <i>Its like a horror SciFi show, but real!</i></p><p>“Nothing besides your body.” The lights seemed to grow bright for a moment. “It’s a fine creature I created. Alas, such a creature as you does not exist naturally. You are the only one of your kind, thus I granted you immortality. As I have now done with the heavenly sisters. Beware young one, this is both a blessing and a curse. You and yours will need to support each other.”</p><p>“Why me?” I was genuinely curious.</p><p>“I needed someone with knowledge of this world. And I needed someone who would help.” She seemed to pause for a moment. “And I needed someone not attached to the world they lived in. I would never separate family or friends unwillingly. You weren’t my first choice, there were others. But they were all, to attached to their life. They didn’t want to leave, not truly.”</p><p>“And I wasn’t!? How do you know!?”</p><p>“I looked into your mind. So much sadness, so many memories of a life you couldn’t have anymore. You wanted to get away from the world. Start a new life far away. So I fulfilled your wishes, I gave you a new start. I hope you make the best of it.” The voice seemed to smile. The lights began to fade around us.</p><p>“Now wake young one. You are missed.” Harmony whispered before I fell into darkness.</p>

<p>My vision returned slowly and me head ached. I stumbled to me feet and held a hand to my head. <i>Hand? Why am I confused about having a hand?</i> I shook my head to try and clear it, but that just made the problem worse. I fell into a tree and leaned on it for support. I could hear a crackling sound, not unlike fire. I looked toward the sound and saw a blazing forest behind me.</p><p>My head pain suddenly forgotten I ran from the fire, only to go back instead of forward. The faster I ran, the faster I went back. I grabbed tree limbs and bushes to try and keep myself from burning. But the fire won in the end and I was dragged into the inferno.</p><p>I coughed as smoke filled my lungs with the scent of burning pine. A tree groaned and fell over not far from me. Through it all I felt something pulling my attention behind me. My head began to turn of it’s on will, and in the middle of the inferno I saw a car.</p><hr/><p>“WAKE UP!!!” I was startled awake by a very upset gray blob. <i>The gray blob is talking? It must be Monday.</i> My irrational mind slapped a sentence together as my head fell back again. “No!” A sharp pain on my face jerked me awake. I looked up at Starswirl we’ll i held my face with a wing. <i>Did you just slap me?</i>. My eyes must have asked the same question because he stated very plainl his answer. “Yes, I just slapped you.” <i>Ok, now that that’s cleared up.</i> Fire flashed in my mind. <i>Huh.....</i> I must have froze up again becuase Starswirl started shaking me with his magic. “Stay with me Night! You’ve been hit by the Elements, who knows what damage you could have suffered!?” I just stared blankly at him. I grabbed a piece of paper from a nearby desk. <i>Oh look. We’re in a building.</i> I yanked out a feather without a second thought, or flinch, and grabbed an ink bottle from the same desk. I simply wrote ‘I’m fine’. I then dropped the parchment and stared at the wall.</p><p><i>My family is gone. I was...I didn’t even </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">think</span><i> about them!!</i> My mind degraded further into a state of panic. <i>One moment I’m not even aware of them, and the next they're just gone!</i> I think Starswirl was shaking me, but I didn’t care. I payed back down and started to drift away. <i>What am I gunna do?</i> With that last thought my mind surrendered to sleep.</p><hr/><p>I was again rudely awoken. This time however it wasn’t by a slap. It was by the sobbing of a tiny blue horse. Luna was nestled into my wing as she cried her eyes out. The room smelled faintly of flowers and I spotted a vase of flowers on the bedside table. As well as a sleeping Celestia on a cushion in the corner. Luna, though she was half asleep, seemed to be deeply distressed. Her half closed eyes were full of tears. <i>Oh Luna, don’t cry.</i> I raised a wing a gently rubbed her with it. <i>Im fine. Don’t worry.</i> Luna’s eyes finally closed as she drifted off into sleep. Shortly after a small smile graced her lips.</p><p>As I lie down I started to think. <i>What am I going to do now? If Harmony is telling the truth I’m going to live for all eternity. I should have died in the crash, not live forever without my family.</i> I had to fight tears. <i>What am I without a family? I’ve always depended on them. And I’ve always been there for them. Through the good and the bad.</i> I thought about my mom and dad. And my brother. <i>I can’t do this! Not forever without them!</i> I considered ending it there. I could simply fly up high and close my wings. But something stopped me. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">You and yours will have to support each other.</span> Harmony’s words echoed through my head. <i>Am I truly alone?</i></p><p>I looked down at Luna, then at Celestia in the corner. I smiled a little as Celestia drooled on the pillow. <i>Maybe....Maybe I do have a family. It’s not my biological one, and I will miss mine. But I can’t leave these ponies. They’ve helped me, and I’ve helped them. And I plan to keep doing so.</i> I snuggled close to Luna and lay in the bed, careful not to disturb either sister. <i>Yes, I’m not truly alone.</i></p><hr/><p>I woke to a bright light beside my head. I slowly opened my eyes to investigate the source. To my surprise it was from a unicorn horn. Or alicorn horn to be more precise. Celestia was standing on the balcony my room apparently had, and her horn was lit very brightly. Beside her Luna was standing, her horn a cool blue instead of the burning yellow of her sisters. The light outside the window seemed to change rapidly, so I stood up and walked behind them to watch what I couldn’t believe was happening. From over the hills was the sun rapidly rose to push back the night, while the night retreated to the far side of the horizon. The moon sank below the sky to rest for the day as the sun took its place high in the sky.</p><p>“Night! Your awake!” Luna exclaimed all of a sudden. “I’m so happy you’re finally up!! It’s been forever!”</p><p>“It has been quite some time friend.” Celestia softly said. “A few weeks in fact.” <i>Weeks?</i> “Starswirl said that you had magic on your mind from the Elements. He said it seemed memories had been unlocked in you mind.” She puased to look at me. I flinched as I thought back to the car. Thankfully the pain was old, even though It seemed I just got the memories back. That combined with my realization the previous night caused the pain to fade to a low dull. It would hurt for a long time. But it was bearable.</p><p>‘He is right.’ I wrote and showed it to the sisters. ‘I remember my time before I met with you all. The good and the bad.’ I paused before I continued writing. ‘I remember the loss of my family. But the pain is less now, so do not worry to much. Besides, i believe I may have found a new family.’ I smiled at them and showed them what I wrote. Celestia sniffled before hugging me and whispering in my ear.</p><p>“Oh Night. I’m sorry to hear about your loss. And I would be honored if you considered us family.”</p><p>“Yeah!!” Luna shouted. “I’ve always wanted another brother or sister to help me beat Tia in magic games!” I laughed as Luna showed how innocent and young she was. ‘So, what have I missed?’ I asked. “We have our own town now!” Luna yelled. <i>What!?</i> I choked on spit from her statement. COUGH COUGH!! I pounded on my chest with a wing.</p><p>“Haha! So easily defeated Nightwing, are you?” Celestia laughed. “Starswirl would have loved to see that.” She giggled a little more before continuing. “Luna is correct, we do have our own town, small though it may be.” ‘How did that happen!?’ I shouted on the paper. “Well you see-“</p><hr/><p>Heavy Set</p><p>Heavy Set was no fool. He knew that the bird he was business partners with wouldn’t stay in his town much longer. Once they defeated this beast they were after they would leave for somewhere. But from hearsay and gossip at the local tavern, he deduced they didn’t really have a home to go back to. But he had heard mention of a crystal tree. And he was going to make sure that they had a home to go back to. So he could get his feathers of course. No other reason.</p><p>So heavy made his way to where he had an old....friend, who would know where this tree was. He was an explorer type. Always sticking his nose in places it was likely to get cut off. Heavy Set arrived at the house he was looking for and promptly spun around and bucked the door open. </p><p>“Danger Seeker! Where are yah?!” Heavy yelled into the building.</p><p>“Ah!” Someone screamed in the back. “Heavy! Such a....pleasant surprise!” A pony nervously chuckled as he came into the front of his home. He was a brown pegasus with a black and gray mane.</p><p>“Yeah yeah, listen I need a, favor!” Heavy said with a smile.</p><p>“Lo-look Heavy, I already paid you back okay? You don’t need to do this.”</p><p>“Oh but I do. Yah see I’m looking for a certain crystal tree. And I’m sure you know of it.” Heavy’s smile vanished. “Now spill the beans.”</p><p>“Look heavy, I just can’t unless you have money. I log special locations for records, and you can’t know where they are unless you pay. And I don’t owe you anything anymore. So you can’t make me!” Danger looked at him with a defiant glare.</p><p>“Oh really?” Heavy started to smirk. “Well then, I suppose yer right. I can’t do nothin.” Heavy turned to leave and Danger calmed down and gave a slightly confused smile.</p><p>“Good! Well, um, see you later I guess?” Danger just wanted Heavy to leave.</p><p>“Sure sure. But um.” Heavy’s smirk grew to epic proportions. “Apparently I won’t be able to make that next shipment of reinforced quills to you. My backs been hurting you see.” Danger’s smile immediately dropped.</p><p>“You wouldn’t dare.” </p><p>“Oh I would. I know how much you need those quills for all the notes you take. Unless of course, you want to pluck yourself bare.”</p><p>“Now,li-listen Heavy. Let’s not go crazy here.” But Heavy was already walking out. “Wait! Heavy don’t do this! Please!!” Danger ran after him. “Please stop! Don’t do-I’ll do anything! Anything!”</p><p>“Anything? Even tell me the location of a certain tree?” Danger has to think for a moment. Was it worth it? Yes. Yes it was. He need to take those notes. Needed to.</p><p>“Yes! Yes I’ll tell you!” Danger shouted. Heavy just smirked.</p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p>“So Heavy Set got the towns ponies inspired to build this town for us, and establish us as the rulers of the area.....apparently.” Celestia finished recounting to Nightwing. <i>What? Just....what?</i> I just sat down for a moment. “Oh! And one more thing!” Celestia looked at the door. “Sliver Wing! Please come in!” We all looked at the door as nothing happened. Celestia sighed and looked at the ground. “Luna? Could you-?” Celestia pointed at the door. <i>What now?</i></p><p>“Silver Wing! Could you come here!? I want you to meet my other friend! I think you’ll like him!” Luna called to the door. It immediately opened to show the Batpony that helped kill the beast.</p><p>“You called your majesty?” Silver asked as she stepped into the room. Celestia just huffed while Luna laughed. I, on the other hand, was immediately on my feet. <i>Oh. My. God.</i> </p><p>I lunged at her and her eyes widened as she tried to draw her wing blades to defend herself. Alas I was to fast for her. Celestia gasped as I tackled Silver to the ground while Luna just watched which a smile on her face.</p><p><i>You. Are! ADORABLE!!!</i> “EEEEEEE!” Was the sound that came from my beak as my feathers gained a light blue tint. I ensnared the pony in my wings and squeezed her close to me as I rubbed my face on her head.</p><p>“Ah! Call off your pet! Please your majesty!” Silver pleaded with Luna. Luna however.....well she was no help.</p><p>“Hahaha!! Night likes you!!” Even Celestia was smirking.</p><p>“Please you majesty! Call off your pet!”</p><p>“Haha! Night isn’t a pet! He’s just as intelligent as you or me. And apparently he likes you!” Celestia laughed. ‘She adorable!’ I wrote on the paper. ‘Can we keep her!?’</p><p>“Well, her people are living in the caves nearby now. They have apparently devoted themselves to Luna.” Celestia explained to me. <i>A whole cave of adorable Bat ponies!?</i> Somewhere a small green alien felt a disturbance in the force.</p>

<p>Third Person</p><p>The Everfree castle was quite the sight. It had huge stone walls with parapets and watchtowers. The brand new stone bricks were unmarred by vines or other such plants, and had an almost shiny quality to them. The walls surrounded a small village with a couple hundred houses. Heavy and the village he brought had picked up other settlements on the way, making for quite a sizable population.</p><p>The houses where mostly wood walled with straw roofs and poor quality glass windows. But there were some houses closer to the castle that were different. These houses were more like marble mansions. A few nobles from the old pony tribes had shown up. And of course they began sucking up to the princesses and building big mansions. These mansions were ridiculously over the top. They had white marble walls and gold plated roofs. Perfectly clear glass in the windows and marble columns around the outside. Fortunately there were only three, and they weren’t huge compared to some things on earth. They were about three times the size of the other homes though.</p><p>Then the castle itself sat in the middle of it all. Beautifully built walls and a large front gate. It had four large towers with bridges connecting them to each other. The stone brick walls were accented by the gold roofs and silver door frames. The front gate was solid oak with silver framing the outer edges. Under the silver however was a solid iron frame to stop any sieges against the castle. The windows were large and ornate with silver plated iron frames, and large balconies for every room in the towers. The floors inside the main hall were white marble with black at the edges of the walls. There were large white stone columns with gold spiraling around them to the roof, and a raised platform upon which sat two thrones. A large gold throne with silver accents, and a large obsidian throne with the same silver accents. The Batponies has supplied the obsidian for Luna’s throne. They said that it did the night queen justice.</p><p>They weren’t very happy that Luna was ruling alongside Celestia, but they grudgingly accepted when they were told that they were sisters. They were however, very happy about Night. Which made it much easier for him to get into their cave and snuggle them endlessly. Much to their confusion.</p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p><i>Give me all the snuggles!!!</i> I shouted in my head as I attempted to strangle a Batpony in my wings. “Please let me go...” Said Batpony asked nervously. He looked all the more adorable in his bright blue armor. “Eeee!” He let out a bat squeak as I squeezed one last time before I let go to find my next victim.</p><p>“Night! Stop torturing the poor ponies!” Shouted Swirl. He held a hoof to his face as I gave him a sad look. “Please act your age.” He stopped to think for a minute. “Or at least act mature. I’m not sure how old you are.” <i>Fiiiine. I suppose I can hold for a little while...</i> I stepped away from a shivering guard mare. But not before giving her a look. <i>Ill be back for you......</i> She seemed to shiver even more.</p><p>“Just...follow me Night. We are have spent far to much time here as it is. We need to get you acquainted with the town. Most ponies do not even know you exist, and you were not awake for the reward ceremony.” Swirl grumbled a little bit as his look soured. “Oh how I simply can not wait for the joy of introducing you to the crowds.” <i>Ow, my feelings.</i> Starswirl must have realized how it sounded becuase he apologized. “I am sorry Night. It is just....with the arrival of the Lunar Pegasi ponies are already on edge. They are a completely new species, to to mention they possess slight dark magic.” Starswirl sighed. “That alone nearly brought the ponies to a riot. I had to make a public announcement that becuase they are creatures of darkness the dark magic will not drive them insane.” Swirl stopped to rub at his temples. “You have no idea how many question I was asked about them sneaking into houses and drinking everypony’s blood. They do not even <b>drink</b> blood. They eat FRUIT!” Swirl once again sighed. “And that was the reaction to a new herbivore species. I do not want to imagine the reaction to a new carnivorous or omnivorous species. Which ever one you are.”</p><p>“Chirp!” I leaned over to comfort Swirl with a wing rub. “Puuuur!” I purred at him, trying to calm him. He just sighed again.</p><p>“Please just, don’t scare them to much.” He began to walk to the outer wall’s gate. “I know the ‘Batponies’, as you call them, love you and Luna. But normal ponies will have a much more......unwelcome reaction to you.” The gate was open at the time so we walked on through. The gate didn’t close until nightfall. And It didn’t open until sunrise. </p><p>Already we were getting looks by the ponies walking down the roads. Yes, they even had cobblestone roads. <i>I’m amazed they got this all done in a month! Magic!</i> Several ponies went out of there way to stay as far as possible from me. <i>Hmmm. It appears Swirly may be right about one thing. These ponies are ready to run from me at the slightest hint of danger.</i> Starswirl was headed for a large stage in the main square. The main square was directly in front of the main castle door, and had most of the market stalls held in it. As we made our way to the stage ponies had already began to gather. All of them looking nervously at me.</p><p>We went around to the stairs on the side and Swirl walked up onto the stage. I followed behind, or at least tried to. The steps were a bit small for me. <i>Welp, more than one way to skin a cat I suppose.</i> I opened my wings and flapped twice to get onto the stage top. Almost all the gathered ponies took a step back and gasped. <i>Yes yes. I’m know I’m beautiful. No need to make a big deal about it.</i> I laughed at my internal monologue and stood beside Swirl as he began to speak.</p><p>“Attention fellow ponies! Today is another fine day in Equestria is it not!?” Swirl shouted at the top of his lungs. He seemed to be trying to break the ice with the crowd. “Today we have a very good friend of mine and the Princesses with us! He has been incapacitated for the last month and was unable to attend the reward ceremony!” The ponies seemed less nervous and more curious now. Why was I getting a reward they seemed to be wondering. “Nevertheless! He was instrumental in bringing down the shadow beast plaguing our lands! May I introduce Nightwing! Avian of the Night! And Princess Luna’s personal guard!” <i>Wait what?</i> The ponies all perked up at this announcement, seeming to forget most of their nervousness. “As such I present to him a token of our thanks!” Swirl levitated up a blueish Silver breastplate that seemed made for me. “This enchanted breastplate, made metal created from his own feathers! Crafted by our own Heavy Set! May It grant you eternal protection!” He levitated the breastplate over to me and slipped it over my chest. It seemed to lock around my neck, and gently caress my wing joints. It was made of the same material that made my wing blades, and had a small obsidian crescent moon in the center.</p><p>The ponies all cheered as me and Swirl walked away from the stage and into the castle. ‘So when did I get promoted to personal guard?’ I asked on the paper I brought with me. “Oh that was Luna’s doing. But do not worry. You will not be working alone.” Swirl opened a side door to reveal four Lunar Pegasi in the same armor I was wearing, but with silver moons instead of obsidian. And among them were Silver Wing, and the guard mare that escaped my clutches earlier. All the Batponies perked up at my entrance except those two. They knew better. They knew the carnage I was capable of committing. They shivered as I stepped into the room and locked the door. Swirl just sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>Silver Wing</p><p>I sat down in the new bar and ordered a hard cider. Some drink the ponies made with apples. Of course it was a big hit with us since we loved fruit.</p><p>The bar had been constructed pretty soon after the ponies all settled down. After all, you can’t have a happy town without a bar right? It was a log cabin like building, with high ceilings and a second floor. It had a second floor that ran along the walls do you could look down to the first floor, and a main bar where the bartender was handing out drinks. Of course, most of the ponies left when I sat down. Only a few remained.</p><p>“Hey Silver!” Moon beam, another Thestral, shouted to me. “What’s up!?” She came and sat to my right, also ordering a hard cider.</p><p>“Oh nothing. Just trying to straighten out my neck from our new ‘captain’” I replied. We thestrals were more militaristic than the ponies of the day. Thus, having the buffoon Nightwing as her captain.....it was very irritating.</p><p>“Oh give him a break!” Lunar Lotus sat on the other side of me. “He <b>did</b> help fight the shadow. And he did a lot of damage to it if the story <b>you</b> told us is true.” Lotus also ordered a hard cider. It was quite popular among us thestrals. I took a sip of my drink before replying.</p><p>“Be that as it may, he doesn’t act like a captain should. He has no experience, and he demands no respect. All he does is-“ I shivered for a second. “.....I don’t want to talk about it.” I took a deep gulp of my drink.</p><p>“It’s not that baaad!” Moon said from my right. “You’re just a stick in the mud some times.” She took a sip from her mug. “Besides, if what that Starswirl pony told us is true, he has no combat experience. Which means he did really good with the shadow.” She looked into her mug for a second before smirking at me. “Remind you of anyone else? Hmm?” She downed the rest of her drink and got up from her seat. “Think about when you were young Silver. You were almost the exact same.” With that she walked out the front door just as Black Iron walked in. They exchanged a quick greeting before Moon left and Black walked over. His name was very fitting as his mane was a pitch black color.</p><p>“By the expression on your face I assume your talking about our new captain?” Black asked as he took Moon’s spot. He to ordered a hard cider. He took a drink then burped before saying anything else. “He has potential you know. Reminds me of you before you were trained. Taking on a couple bandits in the woods is no easy feat for an untrained filly.” He drank some more as I stared into my mostly untouched drink. He was right of course. Night did show potential. But he had no training.</p><p>“Well, her majesty did choose him to be the leader.” Lotus paused from guzzling her third mug. “Not much we can do about it.” I sighed. She was right.</p><p>“There’s only one thing to do then.” I downed the rest of my drink in one gulp. Hoping it would lessen the sting of what I was about to say. “We’ll just have to train him.”</p><hr/><p>“Keeear!!” Night shouted as I struck him on the head.</p><p>“Then dodge the stick!” I yelled at him. “It’s simple! Don’t get hit and it won’t hurt!” I swung the sword shaped stick at him some more as he futilely attempted to block with his wooden wing coverings. “You can’t be a captain of anything if you fight like that!” I yelled at him again. I was pushing him in a circle around the training area. It was located inside the inner wall of the castle. It was mostly used by the Solar Guards, but that was no surprise since not many ponies wanted to guard with Thestrals. There were a few, but the Lunar Guard’s numbers were much lower than the Solar Guard’s.</p><p>“You can do it Night! Shouted Moon from the edge of the circle. “Just stop being bad and you’ll be fine!!” <i>Very helpful.</i></p><p>“Keeeear!” Night cries and went on the offensive. Or he tried to anyways. He lunged at me with his wing covers....and I side stepped and hit him on the head. I stopped and sighed.</p><p>“We have so far to go.” I moaned as Night stood up and started spitting dirt.</p><hr/><p>One Month Later<br/>Nightwing</p><p>“Keeear!” I screeched at Silver.</p><p>“Then dodge the darn stick!!!” Silver yelled at me. We were in the same circle we had trained in every. Single. Day. For a month! Now our training was a favorite pass time for many of the guards on their off shifts. Even Starswirl was smirking at me from the sidelines. I suspected he just enjoyed seeing me get hit with a stick.</p><p>To be honest I was doing better. I wasn’t nearly as good as the Thestrals, but I was improving. Not every swing hit me now and I even got close to hitting Silver! I was better against the other Thestrals, but I suspected Silver had a bit more training.</p><p>She swung at me again and I managed to actually block it for once. “Good job! You finally blocked one!” She then followed up this praise with a jab to my neck. I jumped back out of the way before lunging forward to hit her. I swung at her shoulder but she dodged out of the way easily. Then she opened her own wings and flipped over me before smacking me in the back of the head. Once again sending me into the dirt. <i>I hate this so much......</i></p><hr/><p>Two Months Later</p><p>I dodged out of the way of Silver’s swing and swatted it into the ground with my wing. She quickly pulled her sword back to block my wing covers from hitting her. Hers ears pinned down on her head as she pushed me back before take a swing at my head. I swiftly ducked under the swin to return a swipe at her.</p><p>“Your getting much better!” She stated. “But-” She ducked under my swing and jabbed the underside of my wing with here sword. “-you have yet-“ she swung again at me as I drew back. <i>Ouch!</i> The blow to my wing hurt very bad, yet I continued fighting. I pushed her back towards the circle edge as I went on the offensive. Right before she stepped out of the circle she tried to press me back. Only for me to get a wing in and hit her across the head. “-to defeat me.” She finished as she lay on the ground exhausted. Then she started to laugh.</p><p>“Finally! It took you long enough to throw me into the dirt! Three whole months and you’ve finally managed to hit me!” She laughed some more as she shakily stood up. “I have to say, you have a mean right wing.” She winced as she held her head. “Okay, we’re done for today.”</p><p>“Chirp?” I asked her.</p><p>“I’ll be fine!” She waved me off.</p><p>“Woohoo! Night!” Moon shouted from the side. A few of the other guards were cheering as well.</p><p>“About time you beat her into the ground!” Swirl walked up to me laughing. “Seeing you get hit with a stick was almost getting old!” He stopped to think for a moment. “Never mind. That will never get old.” He walked off into the castle cackling like a mad man.</p><p>“Come on. Drinks on me.” Silver announced</p><hr/><p>Silver led me, Black, Moon, And Lotus to the bar. We all sat at the main bar and ordered hard ciders. To be honest I had never drank a lot of alcohol, so the strong smelling drink made me slightly nervous. “Come on! It won’t Bite!” Black stated before taking a large gulp of his drink. His slammed his mug down and belched. “Not much anyways.”</p><p>“You look like your scared of a little alcohol. Could the mighty Nightwing really be worried over such a thing?” Lotus asked me smugly. I just gave her a blank stare.</p><p>“Oh lighten up Night! We’re just teasing!” Moon said before taking a swig of drink. “Not like anything could go wrong.” I looked nervously a my drink before levitating it to may beak.</p><p>“Did you seriously just say that Moon?” Black asked. “Now I’m worried something <b>will</b> happen.” He laughed. I just looked at them all before giving up. <i>Whats the wors- Nope! Not finishing that sentence! Never!</i> I promptly threw the mug back and downed it all in one go.</p><hr/><p><i>WHYYYYYYYY!?!?</i> I screamed in my head as I woke up in my bed. The sun was so bright! <i>Aaaarg!! DIIIIIIIIIE!!!</i> I shrieked internally at the sun.</p>

					</header>


<p>Over the past three months a lot had happened. More ponies had filtered into the now small city.  More houses were built, and latge farms had sprung up around the outside of the walls. The forest made that slightly difficult, but the ponies managed to clear what land they needed. I looked down upon all of this as I soared through the air. </p><p>I was flying towards Celestia’s balcony in a hurry. She and Swirl said they need me and a few other guards for something important. Lotus and Black were meeting in the main hall where two other solar guards were meeting as well. But they requested that I meet them in a more private setting. <i>What has happened now?</i> I couldn’t help but wonder.</p><p>I kicked up a few leaves as I landed on Celestia’s huge balcony. “Caw!” I called out as I tapped on the window.</p><p>“Yes yes. Come in Night.” Swirl called from inside. I pushed open the glass doors and strode into the room. “About time you showed up!” Swirl had a small sfrown on his face. Celestia’s room was pretty....pretty I guess. White marble floor, with white stone walls. Gold accents on everything. And it half the size of a house. <i>How much space could you possibly need?</i></p><p>“Hello brother!” Celestia greeted me. Ah yes, that happened over the months as well. Me and the sisters had grown closer together, to the point of me gaining ‘brother status’. I couldn’t help but smile a little at her greeting.</p><p>“Chirp!” I greeted back and hugged her with a wing.</p><p>“Focus you two. We have important business to deal with.” Swirl interrupted. ‘Fine, what’s wrong?’ I wrote on some paper. Starswirl sighed before answering. “It seems that another small nation of ponies farther south is.....unhappy with our taking over this land.” An irritated look grew on his face. “This isn’t even their land! They said they were going to ‘claim it in the future’.”</p><p>“A few strange Pegasi flew over our town the other day. They circled a few times then flew off in the direction of the other city. It seems they were scouting us. The next morning a letter arrived with an armored guard. It stated that we had invaded land they wished to claim in the future, and we were to vacate immediately.” Her eyes narrowed for a second. “Or there would be consequences...” The words hung in the air for several seconds. <i>A rival nation threatened us?</i> My eyes widened fo a second. <i>Ooooh boy.</i></p><p>‘What is the plan?’ I asked. Starswirl answered, “The plan is for you and a small group of guards, you already know who, to deliver a letter to the city. This letter will state our intentions to stay on this land, and our hope that we can coexist peacefully.” He grumbled. “Even if they are irritating as hay.” Celestia gave a small smile at Starswirl.</p><p>“There <b>is</b> another objective as well. We wish to see how these ponies will react to two new races.” Celestia explained. “You must use the utmost caution Night. You may not be received well.” Celestia released a long slow breath. “Please be safe out there. We couldn’t bear to lose you.” Celestia gave me a hug.</p><p>“Darn bird.” Swirl grumbled as he gave me a pat on the back. <i>Oh, you know you love me Swirly.</i> I snickered at him. “Now begone with you! The others have already been instructed as to these events. They are most likely waiting for you by the gates.” Swirl shooed me out the door and off th balcony.</p><p>“Hur hur hur!” I laughed as I flew away. I flew swiftly over the town, ponies looking up as the strange shadow passed. A few of them smiled but most just looked slightly nervous. <i>Better than when I first showed up in public.</i> I could see a small group of guards by the front gate. They where leaning against the wall talking to each other.</p><p>The solar guards had quickly accepted the Thestrals over the three months. In fact, the Lunar guards had started to get as full as the solar. And not just with Thestrals. Regular ponies had started to join regularly, seeming to have gotten over their fear of the Batponies.</p><p>The two solar guards by the gate were field officers judging by the mark on their armor’s shoulders . They were right above infantry but below officer. Infantry was the lowest rank in the guard. Everyone started out as infantry and worked their way up the ranks, except for a few exceptions. Then came field officers. These were the soldiers that commanded from the field. They typically relayed orders from the Officers. The Officers commanded multiple field officers, and above them were the Captains. There were only ever four Captains. One for the solar guard, one for the lunar guard. One for the solar <b>personal</b> guard, and one for the Lunar personal guard. Captain was the highest rank possible and they commanded the officers and everyone below them. Thus when I landed, the two field commanders jumped up and saluted.</p><p>“Chirp.” I said at them. They looked at each other and held their salute. <i>Oh boy. This is going to be interesting.</i> ‘At ease.’ I made appear on my wing. I had learned how to do it during training, writing on my wings, but I constantly forgot I could do it. I had gotten used to writing on scrolls. The two soilders relaxed and dropped their forelegs to the ground.</p><p>“Greetings Captain Night!” The left solder greeted. He was unicorn that had a mane with two bright shades of blue and a white coat. <i>Oh boy, I wonder who’s ancestor you are.</i> I smiled. He had, surprise, a red shield for a cutie mark. “My name is Field Officer Gleaming Shield.” Gleaming pointed to his right. “This is Field Officer Armor Breaker.” Armor Breaker was another unicorn. He had a slightly longer horn than normal and his mane was a dull red. His coat was a light gray to complement the dull red.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you Captain.” Armor said in a very serious tone. In fact he looked like a very serious pony. The way he stood and talked made it seem like he was all business. We have already been briefed on the situation. We are ready to leave whenever you are.”</p><p>“Yep!” Lotus exclaimed. “Got all our supplies already packed.” She motioned to the saddle bags they all were wearing. <i>Shoot! I knew I forgot something!</i> I didn’t bring anything with me. “And don’t worry, I already grabbed your stuff for you.” She smirked and threw a bag to me. It had was designed to slip onto my back between my wings. It had my breastplate and wing blades clipped onto the side of it.</p><p>“Chirp!” ‘Thank you.’ I wrote across my wing as I slipped on the wing blades and breastplate. The breastplate was made of the same material as my wings, so It could also be used for a bigger scrying surface than my wing blades. I looked through the bag to find two blankets, two canteens, a stack of paper, an inkwell, and a small wooden box with several quills in it. I slipped the letter from Starswirl out from under my wing and put it in the bag. ‘Ok then, shall we head out?’ I asked.</p><p>“Ready when you are.” Black responded.</p><hr/><p>One Week Later<br/>Starswirl</p><p>I walked through the hall of the new magic school. The massive stone building sat right beside the school. It’s silver capped roofs and marble floors shown with a newness that almost hurt to look at. For the first time in a while I had been smiling all day. My ripe age of 137 had left me grumpy usually. But today was different. I had spent all morning instructing young ones in the art of magic. It was exciting enough to make my heart race! My bones may be old, but my mind was as sharp as ever. The looks on the young unicorns faces filled me with joy as they learned things they never knew about. New ways to use magic. New to them anyways.</p><p>I walked down the hall slowly, my shoulder had been hurting the last hour and I had been tired the past couple of days. As I approached my office door my chest started hurting. I gasped as I reached for the handle. <i>Whats wrong with me?</i> I pushed open the door and stumbled toward my desk. I fell flat on my face before I made it halfway. My vision was fading as I drifted to sleep, and I tried to channel a light spell to my horn. Anything to let someone know I needed help! However, as I channeled the energy to my horn......my vision finally faded.</p><hr/><p>Third Person</p><p>The energy building up inside Starswirl horn didn’t stop when he passed out. In fact it grew and grew until his horn could hold no more mana. Then it released in a large beam that burst through the roof and into the sky. The sisters could see the beam clearly from their castle. Upon noticing the color, they knew the worst had happened.</p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p>We had finally reached the city after a week. It took a week because our map was sideways for the first two days. Gleaming got a smack on the head for that. But after trekking through the Everfree and vast plains we were here, and I had to say, the city was impressive. It had high walls all the way around with only two entrances. The buildings were higher towards the center and lower around the edges so you could see all the way to the middle of the city. The walls were of dark stone, and the gates were framed in iron. It wasn’t as pretty as the Everfree castle, but it rivaled it in size. It had probably a thousand homes in its walls. The walls had guards constantly patrolling and watching everything in sight.</p><p>We observed all of this from inside the tree line. We were trying to decide the best way to go about this. ‘Lotus, Breaking.’ I got there attention. ‘You stay here as backup, me, Black, and Gleaming will deliver the message. I’ll signal if anything goes wrong.’ Silver had given me tips on basic common sense when in a dangerous situation.</p><p>“What’s the signal?” Gleaming asked me. ‘They’ll know trust me.’ I promptly stepped out of the trees with Gleaming and Black follow me. Gleaming specialized in shield spells apparently, so he would be good to have if anything went south. And Black was a Thestral. And our mission was to introduce Thestrals and myself to the ponies.</p><p>We were spotted the second we stepped out. The gate facing us opened up and at least twenty guards ran out in full armor. I was almost ready to fight until they slowed down in front of us. They were all wearing iron armor and bore iron swords at there sides. They all glared at me and the Black. One of the soldier carefully approached Gleaming.</p><p>“What is you business here?” He demanded.</p><p>“We come from the kingdom to your north, in the Everfree. We bear news from the Princesses!” Gleaming explained. The soldier perked up at that.</p><p>“Yes yes! We’ve been expecting you. Leave your.....bizarre pets outside and come in.” <i>Ouch. My feelings.</i> I glared at the soldier for a moment.</p><p>“I’m afraid I can’t do that sir. These <b>pets</b> as you call them are my superior officers. Unless they are allowed to enter then none of us will.” Gleaming defended us, bringing a smile to my face.</p><p>“HAHAHA!!!” The soldier laughed, along with some of the nearby guards. “These vile creatures are surely nothing more than beast!” He straitened up and continued. “Now come inside. Our leader is expecting you.” At that, Black had had enough of the foolishness.</p><p>“We would be glad to come in. Thank you for offering.” Black stated. All the guards gasped as he spoke. The soldier speaking to Gleaming gasped for a moment before putting on a strained smile. He was also sweating quite a bit.</p><p>“A-ah. I’m am So sorry. I have simply never seen another of your kind.” He tried to explain. “You must be the commanding officer!” He smiled in a hopeful way. <i>You aren’t getting out o this that easy.</i> I almost laughed in my head. Almost. I loved the Thestrals, so seeing someone insult them was mildly irritating.</p><p>“Nnnnope.” Said Black with a smirk. “This is our commanding officer.” He pointed at me a I glared down at him.</p><p>“H-hello?” The now terrified guard said to me. His eyes lifting up to meet mine.</p><p>“Caw!” The guards all flinched at that. ‘It is a.....<b>pleasure</b> to meet you.’ The words scrawled across my wing. The soldier gaped at me before his eyes rolled up and he fell over.</p><hr/><p>My talons clicked on the floor as I sat on a cushion in the main dining hall. The tension was thick enough to cut with a knife. The leader, named Over Time, sat on the other end of the table from me. To my right and left sat Black and Gleaming. On Over’s right and left sat two guards. “S-s-so!” Over stuttered. “My apologies for my guards actions!” He attempted to apologize. Every time I clicked my talon on the stone like a raptor, he flinched. “So! You are here to discuss your surrender of our land yes?” Gleaming choked on his water at my left. Black had an unamused face on as he wiped spit and water from his face. I just looked across the table at Over. I levitated the letter out and slid it down the table to him.</p><p>‘Read that. Then we’ll talk.’ I wrote across my breastplate. Yay for magic metal. He gulped as he took the letter and opened it. His expression changed wildly as he read from the letter. From hope to anger then finally to a blank expression as he set the letter down. He tapped the table twice and the unicorn guard on his left burnt the letter in a ball of fire.</p><p>“Unfortunately these terms are not agreeable. I will have to ask that you and your beast leave. Now.” He pointed towards the door in a angry manner. I quickly stood then spun around towards the door. I heard Black and Gleaming stand up next to me and begin to follow. We walked across the stone floor in a hurried manner, eager to leave.</p><p>Only seconds from the door a pink colored shield sprung up around us, and a faint CLINK was heard. I spun around to see an angry Gleaming drop the shield as the knife fell to the floor. Over had the look of being caught red handed on his face. You know, the look that says ‘oh crap! They saw me!’ The guards beside him jumped up in order to defend him, but I just spun around and left through the door way. Gleaming and Black followed me.</p><hr/><p>I wasn’t worried about getting killed. I couldn’t die now, so that was the least of my concerns. I was however worried about what the kingdom we just left would do in retaliation. The kingdom called Overia. Yeah, that was the name. They had an egotistical hothead for a leader. There was no chance this would just die off. So I took out my irritation on a pack of timberwolves we stumbled across.</p><p>“KEEEEAR!!” I screeched as I quickly dispatched the four wooden wolves.</p><p>“Ok, hand it over Gleaming.” Lotus smirked as Gleaming dropped a small bag of bits in her hoof. “Told you he would take them out in under ten seconds.” Gleaming just let out a groan.</p><p>“That was all my spending money to....” Gleaming looked at the ground.</p><p>“Never make bets with Lotus. Or anyone for that matter.” Laughed Black. “You’ll lose far to much money.” Breaking just stood on the edge of the clearing looking serious. Simply observing his surroundings.</p><p>I stood in the middle of the clearing and took deep breaths. After I had calmed down I stood back up and sighed. ‘I’m sorry about that. Between that pony insulting you and throwing a knife at me.....I lost my temper a bit.’</p><p>“Lost your temper?!” Lotus fell to the ground laughing.</p><p>“What she means to say.” Black glared at Lotus. “Is that you showed surprising control of your temper. Another pony would have attempted to kill him then and there. Yet you walked away.” He smiled at me. “That seems like a pretty good temper to me. One a respectable commander would have.” Gleaming walked up to me.</p><p>“I agree! I was about to take out his guards when you walked through the door!” He shyly rubbed the back of his head. “I suppose I didn’t think about the consequences.” I looked over at Breaking to see what he thought. He just stood there. <i>ooookay then.</i></p><p>Lotus had managed to stop laughing and stood up from her position on the ground. “Oh yeah! A younger Silver would have cut his head off!” She fell down laughing again. I honesty didn’t see what was so funny. She took a minute to calm down before she stood up again. “Okay! Okay. I think I’m done.” She breathed heavily.</p><p>“Come on, we have to get back home and tell Princess Celestia about this development.” Black stated before he started walking in the direction of the castle.</p><p>“Can’t wait to get back and buy some cider with all these bits!” Lotus bragged to Gleaming. I shivered at the thought of more alcohol. <i>Never. Again.</i></p><p>“Okay we get it Lotus. Leave the poor kid alone.” Black defended Gleaming Shield. “Don’t feel bad Gleaming. I’ve lost more than once to her.” He hung his head. “Took me far to long to learn no-“ Black was interrupted as a letter appeared in front of me in a burst of yellow magic. I snatched it out of the air and ripped it open. My eyes widened as I read what it said.</p><hr/><p>Third Person</p><p>Nightwing’s eyes widened as he read the letter. Then, in a flash of blue and black light, he vanished. “So uh, do we just wait her or....” Gleaming asked. Black went over to pick up the fallen letter. Upon reading it his eyes closed for a moment.</p><p>“Come on. It’s time to head home. Starswirl has fallen ill.”</p>

<p>Nightwing</p><p>I laid beside Luna as I attempted to calm her sobbing. Luna’s room was the opposite of Celestia’s in all but size. Black floors and dark blue walls. Silver and Black stood outside the door to make sure no one disturbed us. “Coooooo.” I cooked to Luna. I nuzzled her with my head. Slowly she quieted down and drifted into sleep.</p><p>She had been crying ever since we took her away from Starswirl. The doctors needed to focus and they couldn’t with Luna crying in the room. Me and Celestia had to practically drag her from the room. The doctors predicted Swirl would live, but he would be weak for a long time. Even his magic would be effected due to his surge when he fell unconscious. His magical power would be reduced by one quarter for the rest of his life due to the damage in his horn.</p><p>I left Luna’s night themed room in a bad mood. I nodded to Silver and Black as I made my way to the main hall. The nobles has gotten word of the nation to the south, and that combined with Starswirl’s sudden fall to illness....the nobles had demanded an audience with Celestia. Fortunately for me the main doors were closed when I enter from a side entrance. Celestia was slumped down on her golden throne.</p><p>“Chirp!” I got her attention. She perked up as she looked tiredly at me.</p><p>“Oh. Hello brother. Forgive me for not getting up to greet you. I seem to be quite tir.....” Celestia stopped talking as she drifted into sleep. Her head slowly lowered until it was right above the arm of her throne. Then it suddenly dropped making an audible THUNK as her head hit the metal. “I’M UP STARSWIRL!!!” She yelled before looking around and realizing where she was. She looked down and sighed. “Even in our dreams his state plagues us.” She levitated a letter up to me. “Here, read this. I can't bear to read it again.” I took the letter and unfolded it in front of me, the wax seal already broken. </p><p>The writing was flowery and almost unreadable to my untrained eyes. <br/>‘From <br/>his majesty Over Time.</p><p>I am sorry you could not accept my fair offer. You have forced my hand in the matter. My forces shall be there in a fortnight. I hope you will have reconsidered by that point.’</p><p>I crushed the letter in my talon as it burst into cold blue flames. I slammed the ashes into the marble floor as I looked up at Celestia. “What am I to do Night? We cannot compete against him. His forces are greater and more extensively trained.” She seemed to sink further into her cushion. “I couldn’t bear to move our home now. Not after we have just settled. And with Starswirl as he is.....” She stopped and started to cry softly. Suddenly she jumped up and ran to me. He threw her hooves around my neck and cried into my shoulder. All the while I was forming a plan. My eyes narrowed as a small smile came to my face. I pushed Celestia back for a second. ‘I’ll be back shortly. I may have an idea to help with this situation.’ I spun around and raced over the marble floor and out the main doors. I pushed threw the ponies on the other side, much to their irritation.</p><p>I swiftly took to the skies once I was out side. Over the city I flew, looking down on the oil lamps lighting the streets. Most of the windows were dark. But the building I was targeting had the windows lit with an eternal light. The forge is where I was headed. I landed outside the door and stirred up the dust and leaves on the road. Heavy Set has changed much from his grumpy self in Brightshine. He had gotten much happier since his promotion to royal blacksmith. I knocked on the door in a hurried fashion. “Yes?” He opened the door to see who had interrupted his late night forging. “Nightwing! So nice of you to visit!” His eyes widened and he smiled at me. “I can’t tell yah how much everything yah’ve done for me means!” He practically dragged me into the building. “I’ve been getting yer shipments of feathers by the way! I’ve put them to good use to!” Every time I lost feathers during preening I put them in a box. At the end of the month I sent the box to Heavy.</p><p>“Here! Try these!” He handed me two sharp pieces of blue steel. That’s what we had named the metal made of my feathers. It’s basic ability was the opposite of red steel, which was made with Phoenix feathers. Blue steel froze things, and red steel burned things. The only other difference so far was that blue steel could scry things. ‘Are these....rooster fighting blades?” I held up the very similar looking blades. My friend had showed me pictures of the wicked looking knives one time. The only difference was that they covered the whole foot except my talons. The covering was some kind of blackened leather, which matched my black talons. I slipped them onto my feet on at a time. “Oh! Lift up you back claw!” Heavy looked excited. My black claw fit threw a hole in the leather beside the blade. I lifted it up and with a SHINK the blade retracted into the lower half, leaving a unassuming piece of metal on the glove. I lifted my talon again and the blade slid back out. <i>Well this is going to be useful.</i></p><p>‘Thank you Heavy!’ I happily printed on my wings. I looked around to make sure the building was empty. ‘I have a special request.’ Heavy perked up even more at hearing this.</p><p>“Oh? And what be the request?” He looked at me curiously.</p><p>‘Have you ever heard of a catapult. Or a ballista?’ I asked hopefully. I only knew the basics of how they worked, so I hoped he would know how to make them. Heavy rubbed his chin with a hoof.</p><p>“I can’t say I have. What are they?” Heavy stared at me with joy at the possibility of learning something new.</p><p>‘They are large machines built for war. Made for launching stones and giant spears.’ I paused and looked around again. I didn’t won’t word about the attack getting out yet. ‘There is going to be an attack on the city. No one knows about it except me and Celestia.’ Heavy put in a serious face.</p><p>“From that city in the south eh? I knew they didn’t respond well, but an attack?” His face turned angry. “This place is the best thing that’s happened to me. I won’t lose it. What’s the plan?” I pulled several sheets of paper from a table top and pulled out a loose feather. <i>Finally. That ones been bothering me.</i> “Sorry, But I’m outa ink.” Heavy said as I looked around. <i>Out of ink huh? I don’t have time for this!</i> I concentrated on the feather in my telekinesis and the tip lit up with black magic. <i>Maybe this will work.</i> I put the feather to the paper and drew a basic picture of a ballista with a spear in it. The marks left by the feather sparkled slightly, making the lines of the picture look like they had glitter on them.</p><p>“This is amazing!” Heavy exclaimed when he saw the picture. “Where did you come up with this!?” He looked at me in excitement.</p><p>‘That is a long story my friend. Can you build it?’</p><p>“Of course I can build it! I may need a few helpers though....” Heavy looked thoughtful for a moment. “AHA! I’ve got it! I’ll get Silver anvil, you remember him, and a few construction ponies. Me and Silver will make the metal bits, and the others can slap um together!” Heavy looked as if he were about to start prancing around.</p><p>‘Wonderful! We need several of these. I also have some ideas about specialty arrows for them....’ I drew up another design of an arrow that, once launched, would unfold on the sides and make long ones sticking out. These would spin through the air and down any Pegasi.</p><p>“Night, if you were a mare and not a bird I would kiss you.” Heavy looked at me. “I wil start construction immediately!”</p><p>‘Wait! One more thing.’ I drew up one last picture. This one of a catapult. ‘These launch large boulders. You can even light said boulders in fire. Or replace the big boulder with many smaller ones.’ I stopped to think for a moment. ‘When they are constructed I want some catapults and ballistas hidden in the woods. I want some in the castle as well. Hopefully these will make it an easy battle.’ I turned around to leave. I had several things to do in preparation. ‘It was good to see you Heavy! I’ll be back again! Busy night tonight.’ I walked out the door and took off into the night sky, blending in perfectly.</p><p>I raced just under the clouds to the other side of the castle. I banked right and circled down till I was level with a balcony. I flew towards the lit up doors and landed on the stone deck. TAP TAP! I knocked on the windows quickly with my beak. The pony in the office jumped in his chair when he heard me. “Goodness, you surprised me Night!” He said as he opened the doors. I stepped into the room and looked around. It was the first time I had been in the solar Captain’s office. <i>I probably need to look at my office. I probably have lots of papers to read.</i> His office had plain stone floors and walls. He had a few bookshelves scattered around the edges, and a mirror across from his desk. “What do you need at this late hour my feathered friend?” Light Lance asked as he went back to his desk.</p><p>‘Late? Maybe for you.’ I wrote as I walked over. ‘We have an issue. Overia is moving against us in a fortnight.’</p><p>“What!? Why!? Because we didn’t give them our land!?” Light stood up and started pacing. “We can’t win this! My scouts have seen their forces, they have almost two men for every one of ours!” Light was pacing furiously now and muttering to him self.</p><p>“Caw!” I grabbed his attention. ‘I have that handled, I just need you to accelerate the training of the current recruits by as much as possible. They will help to even the odds.’ I looked directly into his eyes. ‘We can win this. I have an ace in our sleeve.’ I reassured him. ‘Just make sure the guards are ready. I bid you goodnight.’ I walked back out to the balcony and jumped off, only opening my wings when I reached the second story of the castle. I used the extra speed to rocket across the courtyard in the center of the castle. I lifted up and flew up the side of the tower to my balcony. I entered into my room quickly and shut the door behind me. I drew the curtains and walked to the mirror I had hanging on the wall. My room was night themed than most of the castle. It was closer to Luna’s. Black marble floors with silver flecks in them. My bed was a large circle resting against the wall. The stuffing was literally made of clouds, and the comforter was made of blue velvet. I had an empty walk in closet on the side that I used to store my blades and breastplate. I hadn’t gotten any clothes yet, I had no need. Beside the balcony doors I had a writing desk. And in front of me sat a project I had been working on. I had the frame of a mirror, and in the frame seemed to be a window into space.</p><p>I had gotten the royal seamstress to make the place the feathers in such a way that they looked like one solid piece. She was always trying to make me clothes, but I had managed to settle her down with this project. The oval frame was made of silver with onyx inlaid into it in a spiral. I reached up and touched the feathers in the middle and focused on p what I wanted to see. This mirror would give me a bigger viewing surface than my wings.</p><p>The center of the scrying mirror swirled for a minutes before it stopped on a black image. Nothing but black. I frowned at it for a second. <i>Did it not work?</i> The mirror flashed once before showing a circular room with several ponies in it. And in the middle on the mirror was Over Time. His brown coat and black mane caused me to clench my beak for a second.</p><p>“Uh, sir.” One of the unicorns spoke up while looking at the wall.</p><p>“What now!?” Over yelled at him.</p><p>“I-I saw the anti scrying runes flicker. It was probably nothing, they’ve stabilized.” </p><p>“Good! Now no more false alarms!” Over rubbed his temples as he sighed. “Now! Here’s the plan.” He started explaining the plan to, what I assumed, were his generals. I zoomed in on the map he had on the table. “We will approach from the south and the east, the forest is thinner on that side than the west. Once we have breached the outer wall you will command your men to set fire to al building on the way to the castle. When we arrive at the castle we will break open the doors and slaughter their so called, princesses.” Over looked around with a glare. “Is everything clear?” The other ponies nodded. “Excellent! Meeting adjourned. Prepare the forces, we move in one week!” They all filed from the room in an orderly fashion. I stopped concentrating and the mirror faded back to a starry background. I contemplated what I had heard as an asteroid flew past the mirror, leaving a dusty trail behind itself.</p><p><i>So. They plan to attack a week earlier than they said. A surprise attack. I’m glad I told Light to speed up the training. We will need all the soldiers we can get.</i> I stood up and walked over to the writing desk. I pulled over a few sheets of paper and began to write several letters. Forgoing the ink pot, I pulled out a levitated the feather I had used at Heavy’s shop and relit the tip with black fire. <i>This looks so cool.</i> I thought before I began to write.</p><p>‘It seems the enemy is planning to strike a week early. Any efforts you can make to speed up progress would be very much appreciated. Be ready. In one weeks time we battle.</p><p>From Captain of the Lunar Personal Guards, Nightwing.’</p><p>I copied the letter again and sent one to both Light Lance and Heavy Set. <i>I hope we can win this. I don’t know what we’ll do if we lose.</i> One thing was for sure. I wasn’t letting my sisters get slaughtered. My eyes glared into the mirror. <i>You better be ready Over. Nothing is going to stop me from reaching you.</i></p>

<p>One Week Later</p><p>I circled over the castle with two Pegasi in light iron armor. I had on my wing and claw blades, as well as my breastplate. We were watching from high above as we waited for the enemy to appear. The castle had been fortified and the citizens placed in the main castle. Three ballistas sat on watchtowers facing the south and west, and two catapults sat behind the walls. Two more ballistas were in the woods along side another three catapults. Each ballista had a mixture of arrows available to them.</p><p>Maple spears were the spears that unfolded and extended arms out to their sides. They resembled maple seeds as they twirled through the air. Then they had basic spears. And then the Hot Tip spears. Heavy had developed these with some unicorns. The arrows were tipped with gems, which were apparently very common in equestria. The gems were covered in runes. The runes registered hard impacts to the gem. So when the gem tip hit the ground, or a pony, the sensing runes would activatethe second set of runes. Theses runes were designed to release the overpressured magic in the crystals in large fiery explosions.</p><p>The catapults also had a range of ammunition. They had your basic boulders, then they had smooth stone pellets coated in oil. The pellets would be lit on fire before being launched. Hopefully the catapults would set wide areas on fire. We had Pegasi waiting to put out the fires outside the wall after the battle.</p><p>Light had finished the new guards’ training just the day before. <i>Just in time to.</i> Heavy and Silver had not only made the ballistas and catapults, they had also forged iron armor and weapons for all the new guards. All of the guards now had full armor and weapons. Me and the rest of my guards, Silver, Black, Lotus, And Moon, had all gotten blue steel weapons and armor. It was incredibly light and strong. Unfortunately we didn’t have the supplies to make enough for everyone. Unless I wanted to be featherless for a year.</p><p>We circled once more around the castle. The watch guards had yet to raise the alarm. Everyone was anxiously waiting for the enemy to appear. The forest was dead quiet.</p><p>UUUUUUUUUURRRRRR!! A horn sounded from the westernmost tower. “KEEEEAAARRR!!!” I shrieked as me and my entourage turned to fly in that direction. Already I could see enemy units in the distant trees.</p><p>“FIRE CATAPULTS!! FIRE PELLETS!!” Field officers across the wall yelled out in unison. With a loud FWOOSH! what looked like cloud of fire flew out of the trees. The enemy units stopped an gaped for a moment before they charged the wall. “FIRE BALLISTAS!! HOT TIPS!!” With a sharp TWANG! several spots in the enemy units erupted in fire balls. Just in time for the first wave of pellets to hit. The hot tips took out large chunks of the enemy, but the pellets didn’t harm the soldiers themselves. No, the pellets lit the forest ablaze and caused the soldiers to panic. Flaming trees fell across the charging soldiers. They were halfway to the wall now, and you could practically see their fear. </p><p>Then, from behind a wall of clouds, a wall of metal appeared. The enemy Pegasi had arrived. “FIRE THE MAPLES!!!” Another TWANG echoed through the woods. Large spears flew up through the air. The Pegasi simply adjusted their course slightly. After all, how could a simple spear do any damage to them all the way up there? Those thinking that quickly died as I watched the spears unfold just before they hit the flying soldiers. The spinning poles took out huge groups of the pegasi, and in just one volley their forces were cut in half.</p><p>Broken metal forms fell around us as we flew over the enemy army. I had one specific target. The unicorn Over Time. I could see the fear in the soldiers below us. They had never faced such opposition. Yet they courageously marched on. They had almost reached the wall. <i>Therrrrrre!</i>  I hissed in my head as I located Over behind his soldiers. He had a shield over himself as he followed a safe distance behind his army. <i>Your time has come.</i> “KEEEAAARR!!” I started to lower down with my stone faced guards following closely.</p><p>I didn’t lower all they way to the ground, instead I let the heads of the soldiers below slow me down as they hit my wing blades. Some of them bounced of as their helmets protected them. Others had grown a little to tall.... As I finally settled down on the ground I released my claw blades. The soldier beside me didn’t live more than ten seconds after I landed. The one behind him received a knife to the chest.</p><p>I flipped over the dead pony in front of me and pierced my claw blades through the armor of the pony behind him. As he fell dead I threw out a wing and decapitated th soldier charging me from the side. Then I jumped up in time to avoid the blow from behind. I picked up the pony as he landed in the dirt under me. “Aaaah!!” He screamed as my claws dug into his flesh, spreading dark frostbite along his back. “PLEEEASE!!” He so-called out as I lifted him up. I flew over his leader and threw him down at the shield. “NO! NO NO NOOOO-“ His screaming was cut short as he impacted the shield. <i>Not even a crack.</i> I had to admit, Over wasn’t a wimp with magic. But I could do better.</p><p>I left my entourage to take care of the soldiers behind us as I approached Over. He shot a bolt of magic through his shield. I simply side stepped it. His cocky smile made me angrier. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Slaughter their so called princesses..</span> His words ran through my mind as I got closer. He shot another bolt of magic. Once again I stepped around it. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Slaughter their princesses...</span> My feathers started to glow as they darkened. The ground around me turned cold and frost formed on it as I walked closer. Now his eyes were starting to get worried. I was right outside his shield now. He fired another bolt of magic. I didn’t even dodge it, it simply dispersed over my feathers before disappearing. Now the fear shone clear in his eyes. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Slaughter....</span> As I reached his shield I reached out a wing to touch it. I looked over it before looking directly into his terrified eyes. Then I pushed.</p><p>Slowly my wing slipped through the shield. Followed my my foot, then my leg. After a few seconds my whole body was on the inside of his shield. “Wha-what <b>are</b> you!?” He shivered as I reached up a talon to his neck. “AAACK!” He choked as I lifted him off the ground. <i>I won’t lose this family....</i> I bit onto his horn and clenched my beak as hard as I could. “AAAAA-“ His shrieking stopped as his life was ended by my claw. I dropped him on the ground and turned to face my stunned guards.</p><p>‘Finish them off! Let any who run get away, we don’t need to kill them all.’ I marched past them toward the wall. Any soldiers who approached me met a swift end. Just as I was about to kill a soldier in my claw, I stopped. I turned to look into the woods as I threw the pony down. He ran away crying as I peered deep into the trees. <i>THERE!!</i> A bolt of emerald green magic flew from the woods and hit an enemy soldier. Another two followed it and finished the soldier off. As I focused on the origin of the light I could see three black figures. Suddenly a pair of bright blue eyes met mine. Then, they were gone.</p><p>I blinked and stared at the spot for a long minute. Then I shook my head and turned back to the battle. <i>Later.</i> I told myself. There weren’t many ponies left attacking the castle. They hadn’t even breached the wall. I saw a few running, and as per my orders they were not chased. The last of the attackers fell swiftly as the guards inside the castle ran out to finish off the few that remained.</p><hr/><p>The cleanup was long and hard. The bodies cleared from the woods and buried. Friend and foe were buried, none left uncovered. As the last of the bodies was covered up I looked into the small bag I had brought with me. Inside was a single brown horn. <i>To remember what happened today.</i> I tied the bag close and flew off to get cleaned up.</p>

<p>After I had washed the blood from my feathers, and the smell of death didn’t follow me, I walked to Luna’s room. I stopped to knock on the door but stopped myself. <i>I don’t think I can be with Luna with what has happened tonight.</i> Luna wasn’t aware of the battle. She had heard the yells and screams of course, but she didn’t know what was happening. Celestia had made sure of that. So I continued walking aimlessly through the castle, looking out the large windows and into the night sky. <i>For a kid Luna sure is a god artist.</i> I watched as a few shooting stars streaked across the sky.</p><p>Eventually I ended up in the medical wing. I looked around as I realized where I was. I was directly outside of Starswirl’s room. I sighed and entered to check on the still sleeping unicorn. “It is about time you showed up!” Starswirl yelled at me. I just stood in the door choking as I stared at him. “What is it now? I go to sleep for a few days and I wake up to the sounds of mana explosions and battle!” He raised an eyebrow at me. “Well? I’m waiting.” I just rushed up to him and gave him a hug. “Ow! Ok ok!” I pulled back to see him smiling. “It’s good to see you to Night. How are the sisters?” </p><p>‘Wonderful! Have they seen you yet!?’ I excitedly flashed across my feathers.</p><p>“All in due time Night. Now, explain to me what has happened.” And so I did. I explained the response from Overia, and the battle resulting from it.</p><p>‘I have many regrets Starswirl. I regret we weren’t able to peacefully settle the matter. I regret not being here when you were hurt. And I regret how cruelly I killed Over Time.’ I sighed as I sat beside his bed. I opened up the bag around my neck and dumped the horn onto the bed before Swirl. ‘I kept this. To remind me of the unneeded pain I caused.’ Starswirl attempted to pick the horn up in his magic, only for his horn to fizzle out and stop glowing.</p><p>“That will take getting used to.” He looked up at his horn in irritation. Then he picked up the horn I had placed on the bed. “Hmm.” He looked at the horn then back at me. He looked back to the horn as he spun it in his hooves. “Did I ever tell you about the time I beat a bully in school?” He asked all of a sudden.</p><p>‘Um, no?’ I rubbed my head, confused. ‘What does that have to do with anything-‘</p><p>“WHEN I was a young colt.” He interrupted me. “I enrolled in the magic university. Now, I was by no means a strong colt. I was thin and weak. The only thing strong about me was my magic.” He paused as he looked at the horn in front of him in deep thought. His brow furrowed as he continued. “Now, due to my scrawny nature, I was the subject of much bullying. One colt in particular loved to bully me. He would shove me into walls, steal my lunch, whatever he felt like doing. And one day I had enough.” He looked in my eyes now. “I snapped. He came up to me one day and threw me into a wall. And I shot a bolt of magic into his side.” He looked down in regret. “Now, I was never bullied again. I had earned the respect of everyone in the university.” He looked back at me with a pain in his eyes. “And I hated every minute of it. When that poor colt came back to school he was not the same. He could hardly walk. He had permanent scarring on his side. And he had never been strong with magic. He didn’t last a year in the university. When he was kicked out....I never saw him again. He ran from home, off to wherever.” His gaze hardened as he looked into my eyes. “I had ruined that colts life forever. Because I did not control my power. Sometimes, in some situations, those with power have it harder than those without. You have to keep your senses, you can not let it go to your head. And sometimes, even when you are in the right, you have to restrain yourself.” He sighed and looked back at the horn. “No one is going to fault you for what you did. In fact, some may praise you for it. But the question is, how do <b>you</b> feel about what you did? Did it bring you any real satisfaction? Did it fix what was already done? Think about it, and let the answer decide how you handle similar situations in the future.” He handed me back the horn and I slid it back into the bag.</p><p>Did what I get any satisfaction from giving him a cruel death? Did it really solve any problems? <i>No. It ended the same as it would have had I just killed him quickly.</i> “Now!” Swirl exclaimed making me look up. “Let us go get some food shall we? I am starving.” He hopped out of bed and started walking towards the door. He looked back at me when he noticed I wasn’t following. “Come on! I want to leave before the nurse gets back.” He turned back around. “Darn mare will not even let me go to the bathroom by myself.” He muttered under his breath.</p><hr/><p>I hadn’t used my bed much since I woke up from the Elements. But tonight was one of the few times I decided to use it. After Swirl had gotten some food he went back to sleep. And with nothing more for me to do, I decided I might as well sleep. The bed was amazingly soft anyways. Cloud beds for the win.</p><hr/><p>Third Person</p><p>Somewhere in a desert far away, a pony paced back and forth in a large throne room. “Are you <b>sure</b> he saw you?” They asked the smaller ponynin front of them.</p><p>“Yes my queen!” The smaller one had a serious expression on their face. “What are your orders?” The queen thought for a moment.</p><p>“Prepare a small group of warriors. Staying unknown is what keeps us alive. This creature endangers us. Try and remove the memories without harming it. But if that fails.....you know what to do.”</p><p>“Yes my queen.”</p>

<p>Breaking Armor</p><p>I crept through the darkened halls of the castle towards my target. I had my pony disguise on and my golden armor donned. I had received the order only an hour before via the hive mind. It did have a limited range, large though it was, so we had groups of changelings acting as relay points everywhere. The orders were clear. Erase the memories of changelings for Nightwing’s mind or, failing that, kill him. I regretted this happening to him, but the queen gave orders for a reason. To protect us all. </p><p>I was accompanied by two other disguised changelings as I approached the door to our target. Once we arrived outside I looked both way down the hall. Seeing nothing, I cracked open the door and peered inside. I could see everything clearly with my night vision. I looked over to the large bed and saw Night’s sleeping form. His chest slowly rose and fell under the covers. I motioned for my brethren to follow me inside as I skittered into the room. We all walked slowly up to the bed and took positions around Nightwing’s head.</p><p>Looking at the others I nodded and we all lit our horns. After a few seconds small strings of light came off our horns and made their way to the birds head. Once they connected to his forehead he jerked for a second before calming down. Then everything went wrong.</p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p>I slowly opened my eyes to the strangest feeling. A tickling on my forehead. As I opened my eyes enough to see around me they shot open the rest of the way. <i>Changelings!</i> Now, I didn’t have much knowledge on changelings other than that they were evil in the show. And admittedly adorable. So my first reaction was to lash out.</p><p>My left wing shot out and threw the two on my left into the wall, knocking them out. The one on my right jumped back and charged up his horn for something. I didn’t know what but I knew it probably wasn’t good. I launched across the room and tackled him to the ground before head butting him to sleep. <i>Never a dull moment.</i></p><hr/><p>Third Person</p><p>Far away, a certain queen frowned as she felt three of her children go unconscious.</p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p>I dragged three limp lumps down the hall in a bag. I nodded at the very concerned guards I passed on the way to the small dungeon we had. <i>Down the stairs and down the hall, come on bugs! Let’s have a ball!</i> I rhymes inside my head for no reason. <i>You three are heavy!</i> I nodded once more a a random guard. He had a <b>very</b> concerned look on his face.</p><p>“U-um. Do you need hel-“ He stopped as the bag twitched violently. “Did. Did it just move?”</p><p>‘No.’ I looked directly at him. ‘Please fetch Starswirl and Celestia. Let Luna sleep if she is sleeping. And tell her guards to keep a sharp eye out for anything suspicious.’ I continued walking as he hurried off to do as I commanded. I finally reached the door leading under the castle. <i>Sorry guys, gunna get bumpy.</i> I apologized as I started heading down the stairs. I could have used magic to lift them, but you know what? They were doing something to me in my sleep. So they may have deserved to get a little roughed up. <i>Besides, they have natural armor. They’ll be fine.</i></p><p>Once at the bottom of the steps it was just a short trip to the first cell. They were all empty so far. I drug the bag in and walked out, shutting the door behind me. <i>I’ll get the key later.</i> I had left them in my office. Why carry a key ring to bed? Apparently in case you have to arrest people in the middle of the night. <i>The </i><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">one</span><i>time I decide to sleep.</i> I grumbled slightly. The captives stirred inside the prison cell as they awoke.</p><p>A panting Starswirl and Celestia raced down the stairs and though the door. “NIGHT! What’s wrong!? What happe-WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT PONY!?” Celestia screamed as a changeling stepped from the bag. As amusing as her reaction was I had to,stop her from opening the door to help the ‘wounded pony’.</p><p>‘They’re fine Celestia. They are changelings, they just look like that.’ A wave of fire covered the changeling as he saw us. Breaking Armor appeared when the flames disappeared. ‘Or that.’ I sighed. ‘They’re shapeshifters.’</p><p>“Fascinating!” Swirly exclaimed as he pressed up against the bars. “Can you talk?” He asked the changeling. The changeling simply sat down and stared into space for a few seconds. “Can they talk Night?” Swirl turned to look at me.</p><p>‘Yes. Though this one seems to be acting difficult.’ I walked closer to the bars.</p><p>“Difficult? I will not let a moody creature stop my studies!” Swirl announced.</p><p>“And I will not let my children be experimented on.” A regal voice came from the cell. The changelings eyes had turned green. “Now, I have your attention. My name is Queen Lytra. I am speaking through the drone you see in front of you.” She paused to look around her cell. “The only reason you are being graced with my presence is because you have not murdered my subjects like so many others.” She focused in on me. “And you. You have knowledge of our species now. That is why I sent theses three to erase your memories or...dispose of you should that fail.” Lytra jumped back as Celestia slammedinto the bars. Celestia’s eyes glowed and her horn had small sparks flying from it.</p><p>“What did you say?” She asked in a deadly tone. “You were going to dispose of our brother!?” The bars began to melt around her as she stepped forward. “You come into our kingdom, change your forms and infiltrate our guards, then threaten to kill our family members!?” The bars were now nothing more than puddles on the floor. Celestia walked fully into the cell with her eyes glowing and her horn alight. “Give me one reason I shouldn’t end your life now.”</p><p>I ran in and jumped in front of Celestia. I spread my wings wide to block them from seeing each other.  ‘Hey hey hey! Calm down!’ I looked her in the eyes. ‘I’m still here! I’m not dead yet! Let’s at least hear her out.’ I had to admit that I was curious as to why she was speaking to us. ‘Just back out of the...hole in the wall I guess.’ The cell was now just a room on the side of the hall. All the bars had melted. Celestia stared at me for a few seconds before her eyes returned to normal.</p><p>“Very well. We shall see what this cur has to say.” She stiffly walked out of the room to stand beside Starswirl. Swirl took a small step away from her. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">Never</span><i>making her angry.</i> I turned around to look at the body Lytra was speaking through.</p><p>‘What is it you want exactly?’ I looked closely at her. Him. Whatever.</p><p>“What do I want? Well you had better get a lot of paper.” I simply stared at her. “Oh fine, your no fun.” She looked around again. “It would be nice if we could take this somewhere more comfortable.”</p><p>‘I quite like it here.’ I wrote.</p><p>“Fine! Have it your way. I wish to...make a treaty.” At all of our confused looks she explained. “You see, I can’t simply get rid of you all. Not only would that be impossible while also maintaining our secretive status, it would also remove our food source.” Celestia began to heat up again.</p><p>‘They eat emotions Celestia.’ The room cooled down again.</p><p>“Ooh! Quite knowledgeable this one. And how, may I ask, did you come across such information.” The queen looked at me curiously.</p><p>‘No where you need to worry about. No one knows except for those in this room.’ I answered in a reassuring way.</p><p>“Very well. I believe you. Hard to lie to us anyway. What with our ability to detect emotions.’ She smirked at me.</p><p>‘Yep. So what are the terms of this alliance, or treaty.’ She seemed disappointed that I wasn’t surprised.</p><p>“Well, it’s simple really. You tell no one about us and allow us to feed off of your emotions! We won’t hurt anyone of course. That wouldn’t make sense. If we hurt you ponies, we lose food.” She told Starswirl and Celestia. “And in return we can provide assistance in any future battles you face. Your friend Night has already witnessed our battle prowess at your latest skirmish.”</p><p>‘It’s true’. I wrote on my wings. ‘I did witness them helping.’</p><p>“And you didn’t say anything!?” Swirl asked loudly.</p><p>“Your sure our ponies will not suffer from your feeding?” Celestia interrupted.</p><p>“It will be like we were never there.” The queen smirked. Celestia chewed on her lip for a minute.</p><p>“Very well. We accept. It would be nice to make some allies for a change.” She walked forward and shook hooves with the queen.</p><p>‘Wait! I have one request to make before we seal the agreement.’ I interjected.</p><hr/><p>The three changelings smiled as I wrapped them in my wings and crushed them in a hug. <i>I agree with Celestia on this matter. It is very nice to make allies for a change.</i></p>

<p>One Year And Three Months Later</p><p>The city had changed a lot in just a year and a quarter. Equestria was a actual country now, instead of just a large city. The territory of the sisters had expanded greatly. Overia had joined with us soon after their leader and army fell. The citizens almost seemed happy that Over was gone. Of course, the name had to be changed. It was now aptly named Las Pegasus due to the high number of Pegasi living there. Starswirl and the sisters couldn’t figure out why I had laughed for hours at the name. Not that I could blame them. <i>Hah! It’s still funny.</i> I though as I flew over Las Pegasus. I was high in sky, circling above Luna and her entourage.</p><p>Our territory now extended north out of the forest. All the way to what I assumed would be the future city of canterlot. And yes, the mountain was huge. I had flew to the top for fun one night, and the view was amazing. To the west and east were now ours as well. Small towns had begun to form outside the forest. Poor Celestia had been busy with paperwork, electing mayors, and establishing city lines.</p><p>Speaking of change, Luna was now a legal adult at the age of five. I remembered that horses matured faster on earth, but I never thought it would apply to magical ponies. Especially ponies that could live up to one hundred and eighty years! Swirl had a fun time telling me that. Especially when I had a coughing fit over it. Anyway, regardless of how fast ponies matured, the act was that Luna was a desirable young mare. Which meant I had a new duty to attend to. Speaking of which.... A stallion was approaching Luna’s carriage with a small smile on his face. He seemed to think he had gone unnoticed so far, but I could see the small smirk on Silver’s face. <i>Time to start operation, protect/embarrass little sister. GO!</i></p><p>I dropped from the sky at a ridiculous speed. When I was a mere twenty feet in the air I threw out my wings and started flapping to slow down. Yet even as waves of air hit the ground the stallion didn’t notice me. THUMP! I landed on the ground behind the stallion, finally getting his attention. His light blue coat started shaking as he slowly turned around. I leaned in so his forehead was pressed against mine when he completely turned his head around. His ears pressed against his head and his eyes went wide as I stared into his soul. “Chirp.”</p><p>“AAAAAAAAH!” He let out a not so manly scream and bolted.</p><p>“Hur hur hur hur!” I laughed as I walked over to Luna’s carriage.</p><p>“Greetings Captain Night.” Luna said in a very unamused way. She had been a little grumpy with me since I started scaring off all the ponies looking to approach her. Well, not all the ponies. Just the young males.</p><p>‘Lighten up Luna! You’ll thank for this years from now....maybe.’ I laughed at her straight face. I even saw Black crack a smile from behind the carriage. And Lotus was trying to refrain from dying on the left side, beside me. I could almost see the tears of laughter in her eyes. <i>Oh wait. I can see them.</i></p><p>“Night, please don’t be so...overbearing. I am an adult now, and I may date somepony if I so wish.” Luna let out a humph as she turned away from me. “Besides, I am not the only one ‘drowning in stallions’ as you put it. Tia has more approach her than I do. And you don’t protect <b>her</b> from them!” She glared at me.</p><p>‘Your sister can shoot laser beams from her forehead. I think she’ll be ok.’</p><p>“I can too!” Luna shouted at me. I simply sighed.</p><p>‘Luna, Tia is much older than you. She has more experience with this type of thing than you do, so she needs less protection than someone your age. I’m sure that some of the stallions approaching you are nice ponies. But some aren’t, and some may think that they are in love with you! But have any of them actually met you?’ I looked at her intently, making sure I had her attention. ‘And even if they did meet you, they are young. Many of them have more hormones than stars in the sky! So they may honestly think that they love you, when really they’re just physically attracted.’ Luna looked down at this. She felt bad as all the other mares her age had colt friends.</p><p>“I suppose your are right brother. I just see everyone else my age has mare friend or colt friend and...I suppose I feel a little left out.”</p><p>‘I understand. But you know what? All these young relationships? They don’t last long. They may last for a few months, maybe even a year! But they rushed into their partnership. Sometimes they don’t really love one another, so they split up.‘ I lifted her chin up with a wing. When she looked at me I smiled for her. ‘All I’m saying is to give it time. You just turned five not long ago. You have plenty of time!’ I looked around in a conspiratorial manner. Then I put a wing on the other side of my beak as if to block other ponies from overhearing. ‘Besides, you want to know the real reason I protect you more the Celestia? You my favorite sister.’ I joked with her. She knew I was joking, that I loved them the same. But she still smiled.</p><p>“Thank you Night. You always know how to make me feel better.”</p><p>“We’re here!” Moon shouted from the front. I looked up to see we had arrived at a rather large hotel. “I’ll go in to make sure they have your reservation your majesty.” Moon Beam ran into the hotel to make sure the rooms were in order. I took everything up her position on the front of the cart as we waited for her to return. A few moments later she came back out. “Ok! The rooms are ready!” Moon said in a chipper voice. Black and Silver moved to the left of the carriage as Lotus opened the door for Luna to step out. </p><p>“Thank you Lotus.” Luna thanked as she stepped down onto the ground. I had to push back a small crowd of ponies as Black and Silver lead Luna into the Hotel. Lotus and Moon helped me make sure no ponies snuck in to pester Luna.when they got in and closed the door we followed into the building. The lobby was fairly simple. Wood floors and lighter wood walls. A small desk in the center back with a nervous mare behind it.</p><p>“Come with me please your majesty. I have the keys already.” Moon lead the way to the stairs. I approached last and gave the stairs a critical eye. <i>Stairs. My old enemy.</i> I carefully walked up the stairs behind the others. Our rooms were on the top floor, so we took three flights of stairs. Once at the top floor we walked down the hallway to door numbers three twelve and three thirteen.</p><p>‘Ok! Silver, you and Lotus take first shift. Black, you and Moon rest up for second shift.’ They nodded and checked the room three thirteen before Luna entered. After making sure it was safe they allowed Luna in. Silver and Lotus took up positions guarding the door while Black and Moon went into room three twelve to rest until night fall. After I looked around the hall one more time I went down the stairs to exit the building. We were here on a scouting mission. Luna wanted to come with the scouters since she had recently reached adulthood. We were scouting a large bay to the east of Las Pegasus. I had made the suggestion to the sisters that we establish some ports for moving materials. I hoped that this would lead to the discovery of the rest of the world. I knew that griffons and dragons were somewhere. And come on! Who doesn't want to meet a dragon!? Granted, being immortal does make it less scary. But still, <b>dragons!</b></p><p>As I exited the building I approached an inconspicuous pony standing the the corner of two streets nearby. He appeared to be standing there reading a newspaper, but I knew better. I gave a nod to the disguised changeling as I walked past. The Shadow hive, as the Queen Lytra informed us was the name, had been very helpful with surveillance and scouting. I walked back to the carriage and lightly wrapped the straps around my chest. I started pulling the carriage around the corner of the hotel. When I got around to the back I parked it out of the way near the back exit. Next I took to the skies to the other side of town. I had to do a patrol through the woods, some ponies said something about a flying lion. Others said it something about a giant four legged bird. Personally I hoped I was right about what it was. A griffin. If a griffin resided in the woods nearby, well, that would change a lot.</p><p>Once I landed on the edge of town four guards approached me. All were solar pegasi guards, most of the lunar guards were sleeping. “Captain! Reporting for duty!” All of the guards saluted me.</p><p>‘Are all of you prepared?’ They all nodded. Each had a small bag of supplies on them. I decided to travel light, only bringing my armor and blades. ‘Alright, let’s move.’ I took to the sky as they followed me to the woods near by. We glided over several times before descending in a clearing. ‘Ok. Set up a small camp. Nothing big, just something for two days.’ I looked over them as they started making a small camp. <i>We should be done in two days.</i> I looked up at the sky and spread my wings. <i>I might as well get started.</i> I pushed my wings down and left a cloud of dust as I took off.</p><p>I could see for miles over the flat land. Most of it was plains with a few forest scattered here and there. In the very far distance I could see the edge of what was called the badlands. A massive desert. Queen Lytra lived far into the endless desert. I would have to visit one day, if only to see the hive. The hive in the show looked amazing! <i>Focus!</i> I yelled at myself as I flew over the forest below me. I scanned it with sharp eyes, looking for even the slightest of disturbances.</p><p>A fox here. A bluejay there. A rabbit waaay over there. <i>Mmmm. Rabbit.</i> Imlooked up to see the sun was in the middle of the sky. <i>Well, I suppose a lunch break wouldn’t hurt.</i> I turned to the rabbit. He didn’t even realize I was there as I stalked him from high above. When I was just above him I folded my wings and dropped. The wind whistled past my ears as I fell, gaining speed faster and faster. Then when I fell below the tree line I opened my wings and shot forwards at the rabbit. It didn’t even know what hit it as I slammed into it’s small body. The rabbit died instantly from the impact. I flew up again and looked for a river or stream. Quickly locating one I turned to land beside it.</p><p>I landed with a thud beside the river bank. I quickly bit into the delicious rabbit. <i>Yeeeees!</i> Rabbit was turning out to be my favorite food. I had tried squirrel, mole, fish, and even a few small birds. But nothing topped a rabbit. Of course I had to wonder when animals started getting smarter. So far I hadn’t seen any show more intelligence than on earth. Aside from a few exceptions anyways. Like dogs. There were a few wild dogs that showed above average intelligence. I didn’t think I could ever eat a dog though. Soon the rabbit was nothing but a pile of bones on the ground. I walked into the cold water and rinsed off my beach and claws.</p><p>As I was washing, something caught my attention. A SWOOSH went behind me and I paused for a moment before continuing my washing. I pretended to not be concerned as I splashed in the water. <i>Whatever it is, it’s trying to be sneaky. I’ll play along.</i> I stepped out of the water and onto the bank. As gave myself a shake before walking like I was about to take off. I almost smiled as I felt the blade press against my neck.</p><p>“Move, And you die.” A femal voice said from behind me. “I’m not sure what kind of strange griffin you are, but your are going to do exactly as I say.”</p><p>‘Of course.’ I wrote on my shoulder so she could see it. I felt her grip loosen for a second before it retightened.</p><p>“Can you speak?”</p><p>‘Nnnnope.’ She sighed behind me.</p><p>“Wonderful. This makes it all the harder. Still, you will suffice.” Several branches snapped as two more griffins descended from the sky.</p><p>“Halt! In the name of the prince!” The left one yelled. <i>Now this is getting interesting!</i> “We have come to return you to your rightful place beside his majesty! Come with us willingly or you will be punished!” Both were armed with crossbows.</p><p>The female behind me nearly choked me as her grip tightened even more. “Give me a feather, or I’ll slit your throat!” She whisper yelled into my ear. I saw my soldiers in the woods. I used my wing tip to tell them to wait.</p><p>‘Yes, because I can move so well right now.’ She growled before discreetly reaching behind me and ripping out one of my tail feathers. <i>What is it with this world and yanking feathers?</i></p><p>“Sorry fellas!” She slipped my feather into her wing behind my back. “You’ll just have to return empty handed!” She stepped away from me and showed them her wing with my feather. “After all, the prince cant marry a hen that’s already married, can he?” <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">Very</span><i> clever.</i> I smiled internally at the dumbfounded looks on the two male griffins. Suddenly the right one threw down his crossbow.</p><p>“Clipped!” He shouted. <i>Was that a griffin curse word?</i> “Half ways around the world and she’s already married!?” He took off and started flying off. “Ain’t no money worth this trouble!” He broke through the trees and disappeared. The left griffin sighed and looked back at us with a glare.</p><p>“You better watch your backs. The future king will not be happy about this.” He picked up his friend’s weapons and shot into the sky. When he disappeared the griffin behind me let me go and turned me around.</p><p>“Well! I must apologize for my holding you hostage. But it seems I must be on my way! Later!” She tried to take off and run, but a single wing motion from me had her tackled by two pegasi. They swiftly held her on the ground as the other two approached my side.</p><p>‘Bind her wings. We return to town after this.’ The two beside me rushed forward and tied her wings down with a piece of rope.</p><p>“You can’t do this! Let me go!” The griffin screeched on the ground.</p><p>“KKKKEEEEEEAAAAARR!!” She quieted down after that. The guards lifted her up and turned her to face me. ‘You have assaulted a captain of the Lunar guard. You will be detained until further notice. Resistance is futile.’</p><hr/><p>The griffin sat in her cell, tapping the stones and making a soft clicking sound. She hadn’t talked since we brought her back. Luna walked into the small jail and stepped up to the door of the cell. “Night. I see you have captured the creature the peasants were worried about. What is it?” She looked at me in curiosity.</p><p>‘<b>She</b> is a griffin.’ I laughed al little. ‘She has refused to talk since we arrested her.’</p><p>“And why did you arrest her?” Luna asked as I wlked up beside her.</p><p>‘Oh you know, she held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me. Business as usual.’</p><p>“If anyone else said that I would be worried.” Luna turned around to leave the building. “Very well. I shall leave you to question the prisoner. I must join the scouts.”</p><p>‘See ya later Princess.’ The griffin actually reacted as I said goodbye to Luna.</p><p>“Wait!? That was a Princess!?” She started to hyperventilate. “I attacked the captain of the <b>Princess’s</b> guard!? What is she gunna do to me!? What’s the <b>Queen</b> gunna do to me!?” I laughed as she panicked in the cell.</p><p>‘There is no queen. The princesses are the queens.’ I chuckled as she just panicked more. ‘Relax! If you just answer some questions I’ll let you go.’ She calmed down a little at that.</p><p>“You’ll....let me go? Why?” She stared at me in confusion.</p><p>‘It’s simple really. I don’t need a prisoner, you were held me hostage to protect yourself, and if you killed me I would have just hunted you down later.’</p><p>“What?”</p><p>‘I don’t stay dead for long.’ She just lowered her head into her claws and shook her head.</p><p>“Life was so simple before this. I hunted animals for meat. I sold the meat. I made money. Then that stupid prince came and decided he wanted to marry me.” She looked up at the ceiling. “Why can’t life stay simple?”</p><p>“Hur hur hur!” I laughed. She glared at me as I wiped a nonexistent tear from my face. ‘So you get to get married to a prince? What’s so bad about that?’</p><p>“What’s so bad is that I’ll have to go live in the castle! I’ll never go hunting again, never do anything fun, have lots of kids for someone I don’t even love!” She angrily punched the wall beside her. “That’s what’s wrong!”</p><p>‘Hmm. Well, how about this. You answer my questions and I’ll let you go. Then you can fly as far away as you want.’ She looked up at me with a small smile.</p><p>“I think I’d like that. Thanks.”</p><p>‘Ok, first question. What is you name?’</p><p>“Golden Huntress.” I wrote her name down on the paper work that was levitating in front of me.</p><p>‘How did you get here? To this land I mean.’</p><p>“I snuck onto a trade ship when I was running from the prince. When it passed close to the land I jumped off. Griffins never come here, so I thought I would be safe. Obviously not.” She leaned on the wall and sat on the floor.</p><p>‘Why do griffins never come here?’</p><p>“Because this land is unknown. We simply haven’t explored it. We prefer the high mountains, and this land has few of those. All of our cities are on mountain peaks.” She looked at me. “Don’t you come from the griffin lands?” She looked confused.</p><p>‘If provided with a ship, could you point the way to the griffin lands?’ I ignored her question.</p><p>“No way! I’m not going back!” She growled as she approached the cell door.</p><p>‘I wouldn’t make you. But if you were given a compass would you be able to point in the direction?’ I looked up from the paper.</p><p>“Of course! Any griffin worth their salt could point back home!” She stated proudly.</p><p>‘Worth their salt? Are a lot of griffin sailors?’ She laughed.</p><p>“No. But my parents were. And my grandparents. And so on.” She looked longingly up towards the sky. “I guess that’s were I got my sense of adventure from.” She frowned as she looked back to the cell she was in.</p><p>‘Ok!’ I wrote down the last of the information. I walked over to the cell door. ‘A deal is a deal! Your free to go.’ I unlocked the door and swung it open. ‘Oh, one more thing.’ I handed her a compass. ‘Could you point toward griffin land?’</p><p>“Griffin land? Hah! Sure thing. I didn’t think you would actually let me out.” She took the compass and pointed straight West. “Head that way and you’ll hit the coast soon enough. It’s not that long by boat, maybe a week.” She looked at me again. “And, thanks. I guess I owe you one.” With that she walked out the door. I stood there for a few minutes, thinking. <i>Something tells me we’ll see each other again.</i></p>

<p>Four Months Later</p><p>The griffin coast was on the horizon. It had been four months since we went to scout out the bay, and in that time a small town had been built. Well, maybe not small. More medium sized. It had a thousand ponies more or less, with warehouses and big docks for trade ships. Most of the docks were empty when we left. The ponies didn’t have many ships, in fact the one we were on was one of two large vessels. The only other boats we had were small fishing dinghy.</p><p>Starswirl had given me a few lessons on magic before we left. After all, a guard who could fly and use magic was a pretty good guard. Of course he couldn’t teach me some of the magic I could use. Like dark magic. Oooh scary! But in all honesty, dark magic wasn’t bad. It <b>was</b> bad if a light creature used it, because it drove them insane, so it had a bad reputation. Especially since creatures of the light out numbered dark creatures by....all, almost. Well, not if you counted Thestrals, but they could only do one thing with dark magic. All they can do is make the area around them dark or darker, they can’t cast different dark magic spells. In fact, the only beings Swirl had seen who could safely cast dark magic were me, the sisters, and the windigos. <i>I wonder when the sirens show up. Or Tirek.</i></p><p>I glided behind the ship, riding thermals with Moon Beam. We slowly circled around the ship as the land crawled toward us. The griffin lands were full of huge mountains. And I mean huge! <i>That one is almost twice as big as Canterlot mountain!</i> Forest filled the valleys between the mountains, their lush leaves ending at the cliffs that lead to the ocean. Water hit the cliffs and frothed as it splashed high into the air. There were very few beaches we could make landfall at, however I managed to spot a small one.</p><p>“I see a landing location!” Shouted a changeling from the crows nest. The pilot turned the wheel and the ship slowly turned so it was alongside the small beach. Once we were across from it, the sails were lowered and the anchor was tossed into the ocean. Luna walked onto the deck from the captain quarters and, as she strode across the deck, ponies saluted her.</p><p>“How long until we can depart for land?” Luna asked as she looked at the new land. I landed next to her with a thump.</p><p>“We can be ready in just a few minutes your majesty.” A pony answered her.</p><p>“Excellent, I wish to be on land soon as possible.” Luna turned to face me. “Are you ready Night? Today we venture into the unknown.”</p><p>‘Of course I’m ready.’ I looked up into the air. “KEEEE KEEEE!” I called out to the rest of Luna’s guard. Black, Moon, Lotus, and Silver landed behind me in a line. ‘Get ready to move out. Be prepared for anything, we don’t know what’s out there.’</p><hr/><p>We had left the rocky beach not long ago. We were swallowed by the thick trees almost immediately, the forest was extremely dense. Strange sounds filtered through the trees, low whistles and tinkling could be heard every so often. Bright flowers and berry bushes littered the ground and vines hung from many of the trees. There were surprisingly few animals though. We saw a few rabbits and squirrels, even a wild hog ran across the path. But I expected to see more with all the food in the forest. “Why are there no animals?” A thestral asked from the back.</p><p>“Most likely because the griffins eat them.” Luna looked around. “They are not herbivores like us, so the animal population is lower.” Luna explained, which made the guard shiver a little as he looked to the sky. <i>I didn’t even think of that! It would explain the lack of animals.</i></p><p>TINKLE TINKLE! We all looked around at the loud tinkling sound. A small insect flew by and every time it’s wings flapped it let out a small tinkling sound. It looked like a butterfly, but it had six wings made of a crystal substance. “What is it?” Moon asked as she started following it towards the woods.</p><p>“KEEE!” I called out to her. ‘Stay with the group!’ Not a moment later, three tendrils shot out of the woods to grab the crystal butterfly. The butterfly gracefully moved out of the way of the tendrils. Then it gently landed on the top most tendril. Suddenly the tendril erupted with fire. SCREEEEEEEEE!! Something in the woods screamed as the tendrils retracted, and heavy thumps could be heard as it ran off.</p><p>“I-I think I’ll stay with the group now...” Moon ran back to the line. We continued through the forest, though we were much more cautious. Many of the soldiers flinched at every breaking twig. I had to laugh when one jumped at a leaf landing on his back.</p><p>“These forest trees appear to hide many dangers.” Luna calmly looked around. “Such a hostile land, I wonder how the griffins survive so well here.” A few trees nearby shook and we all looked in that direction. The shaking moved towards us until it was just out of our sight. Then it stopped.</p><p>“RRAAAAAAAAWW!!” <i>Is that a....bugbear?</i> The massive creature stepped from behind the trees and faced us with hungry eyes. <i>I forgot that was even a thing.</i> I spread my wings wide and unsheathed my ankle blades. All the other guards did the same as they prepared for combat.</p><p>“HAAAAAA!” A young male voice rang out as a griffin impacted the bear like creature. The big bear hit the ground as the young black colored griffin started tearing into it with his claws. He had a black lion half, with brown feathers on his head.</p><p>“UUUURRR!!” We all watched, stunned, as the young griffin tore out the bears neck. It gasped a few times before falling dead.</p><p>“Nice kill Dark!” A older voice shouted from above. An adult griffin landed beside the freshly killed bugbear. He had a brown lion half and a brown head. “Very quick and clean! I’m proud of you! Now let’s get this thing back to town.”</p><p>“AAAAAAAAAAHH!!” One of the guards in golden armor screamed before running headfirst into a tree. I covered my face with a wing as the griffins looked over in surprise. The guard hit the ground unconscious as a limb fell on top of him.</p><p>“Hello! We come in peace!” Shouted Luna. The griffins looked at each other before the older one nodded at the young one. The young one, Dark I assumed, flew off while the adult approached us.</p><p>“I apologize, I didn’t see you there. Were you hunting this animal? I’m sorry if we stole your kill.” He cautiously stated, ready to bolt at a moments notice.</p><p>“Oh no, we weren’t hunting. It did startle us though, we were preparing to fight it off when you came down.” Luna looked at the dead bugbear. “I must thank you for that. We are new to these lands, I’m sure you can tell.” She smiled at the griffin. “My name is Princess Luna, might I have your name?” She waited expectantly.</p><p>“Yes, my name is Silent Wood.” He looked at all of our guards. “May I assume you arrived by ship? From the unknown lands?”</p><p>“If you mean the lands to the east, then yes. We hail from the kingdom of Equestria. We wish to establish diplomatic ties with your rulers.” She look around the forest. “Would you know where to go in order to get an audience with them?”</p><p>“Well you see-“ Silent started. He was interrupted as griffins in iron amor landed all around us. There must have been fifty, outnumbering us by two to one.</p><p>“Halt! By order of the Pri-!” The guard was interrupted as a crossbow bolt pierced his chest armor.</p><p>“FOR THE KING!!!” Fifty more griffin fell from the sky and attacked the iron clad ones. These new griffins were wearing a much thicker iron armor, yet it didn’t seem to impede them at all. As the area around us turned into a small battleground, we stood in the middle of it all with Silent. We only moved when we had to avoid a griffin hitting us on accident. The new griffins killed the other ones extremely fast, the battle only lasting for a few minutes. “Hah! Take that you scoundrels!” The same Griffin spoke as the last of their enemy flew off. He urned to look at us. “Now, what do we have here?”</p><p>‘Well, you’ve got a pony princess, a giant bird, an patrol of griffins, and a single hunter. I’m still waiting for the punch line honestly.’ The situation was so ridiculous that I said the first thing that came to my head. ‘We're here to have a diplomatic talk with your leader. Although, it appears you may have a....situation with that. Am I right?’ The griffin leader just gaped at me. <i>Oh boy.</i> I sighed. ‘Luna? Could you please explain it to him?’</p><p>“Certainly Night.” Luna stepped forward, taking the leader’s attention away from me. She cleared her throat before speaking. “What he said.”</p><p>“Bu-wha-I.........” He closed his mouth before speaking again. “My name is Crimson Blade. Please follow me.” He started walking off through the woods. As we followed, the rest of the griffins surrounded us on all sides. One of the other guards had picked up the unconscious guards and was carrying him on their back. <i>No end to the excitement. At least I’ll never be bored.</i></p><hr/><p>We all sat in a large dining room. We had walked for hours in the woods before arriving at the port city nearby. It was just behind some cliffs, so we didn’t see it from the ocean. The city also held the king’s castle so that was a plus! Sort of. Me and Luna sat across from King Dusk Song. He had a black lion half, and dark purple feathers. He was currently staring at us from across the long table. He tapped his claws on the table as he stared at us. None of us had spoken once since we arrived in the room. That was three hours ago. The moon had long since risen, thanks to Luna, and the king just continued to stare at us. The only reaction he had shown was when Luna rose the moon, and he mostly looked irritated. The long oak table was covered in a red cloth and nothing else except for the kings golden goblet. I decided enough was enough. ‘Your majesty, we are here to-‘</p><p>“Be silent.” He said in a deep voice. <i>Excuse me?</i> I did a better job at hiding me irritation than Luna did.</p><p>“We have co-“ Luna attempted to say.</p><p>“Be silent!” The king said louder. “I am trying to decide what to do with you.” His eyes narrowed. “A creature who controls the moon? I will not be deceived by your clever trickery. And the inbred spawn of peasants?” He looked at me. “I must simply decide what to do with a liar and her deformed friend.” He laughed. “A kingdom across the sea? Ruled by princesses who raise the sun and moon? How stupid do you think I am!?”</p><p>‘Very!’ I glared at him. ‘We will be leaving now. I advise you don’t follow.’ Me and Luna stood up to leave only for the king to start laughing.</p><p>“Oh you won’t be leaving.”</p><p>“And why is that?” Luna was beyond mad. Her mane had actually started to shift a little, like it wanted to start floating.</p><p>“Because, I have your little guards held captive, and you have no way to escape.” He chuckled “unfortunately for you, I don’t have time to deal with ridiculous things like this.” He slammed his claw down on the table, and the doors opened as guards rushed in. We were surrounded quickly as the king smirked at us. <i>He doesn’t think we can hurt him.</i> I kept my face neutral. “Take them to the gallows. We shall have a hanging in the morn.” Me and Luna looked at each other. We both nodded at what we had to do.</p><p>“Yes your majesty! Right awa-AAAAH!” The griffin guards wing was removed as I swung my wing up. I used magic to harden my feathers and spun in a circle. The guards around me fell as feathers pierced their necks. Luna simply made an expanding forcefield and smushed the griffin on the walls. The king now,looked slightly worried.</p><p>“Guards!” He called. More guards ran in but it was to late. I took to the air with Luna following me. With one last glare at the king, I flew through the windows in the dining room. Luna followed after me as I glided over the city. I saw our guards fighting in the streets below. There were to many for us to fight, and more were coming. I made a quick decision. I slowed down till I was beside Luna.</p><p>‘Drop down when we get above them. Don’t open your wings till I say.’ I looked back to see the griffins chasing us.</p><p>“What? What are you planning to do-“</p><p>‘NOW!’ I folded my wings and Luna closed hers as well. We dropped from the sky at an ever increasing rate. Luna looked worried, but didn’t open her wings. The soldiers below us grew closer and closer. Iron looked up and locked eyes with me. Then he looked down and got the others to form a circle for us to land in. Still we grew closer. Luna was panicking now.</p><p>“Night! When do we open-“</p><p>‘Open open open!!!’ My wings snapped open and I felt the joints strain against the air. Luna had a pained look on her face, but she held her wings open. We were still going down fast, but we were slow enough to not die when we hit the ground. THUMP! We impacted the stone road in the middle of our group. And in a flash we, as well as a few griffins, disappeared.</p><hr/><p>Dusk Song</p><p>I stared out the broken window in disbelief. I had been so quick to assume that they were lying....<i>I think I’ve made a large mistake.</i> I had insulted the leader of another kingdom, and very badly. Then I threatened to hang them. But then they did those impossible things, and I realized how much trouble I had caused. <i>I can’t afford this. Not with the rest of my kingdom slipping away. My son taking things from my kingdom!</i></p><p>I growled as I threw my cup across the room. <i>The towns are slipping from my manipulation. I control less every day. And all because of his stupid kindness and generosity! Who ever cared about those things!?</i> I paced around the room. <i>I need to be rid of him. He is taking away my kingdom, my power! No one can rule these lands but me!</i> I looked out the window once more. <i>I will win, just wait and see.</i></p><hr/><p>Nightwing</p><p>We impacted the wooden ship deck hard. The ponies on the ship looked up in surprise before tackling the griffins. Lotus rubbed her head as she stood up. “I’m guessing it didn’t go well.” She then collapsed, unconscious.</p>
